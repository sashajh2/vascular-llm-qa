C. Left carotid TCAR.

D. Right carotid endarterectomy.

E. Placement on Apixaban and measurement of PF4 with medical management.",D,Right carotid endarterectomy. The patient has evidence of amaurosis fugax with temporary monocular blindness as a sign of symptomatic right internal carotid artery disease. His left carotid artery is in a high-grade range and therefore is lower risk of stroke than the contralateral symptomatic lesion. There should be no immediate surgical treatment of the asymptomatic left carotid lesion. There is no evidence that the patient has an underlying arrythmia that needs cardioversion and medical management with Apixaban and PF4 levels are unrelated to this patient 's current pathology.

3a,apdvs,"gk, lq",lower extremity arterial disease," A 65-year old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco abuse presents to the vascular surgery clinic with complaints of pain in his legs. Patient states that the pain is crampy in quality, mostly in his calf muscles, it starts after he walks 4 blocks, and is worse on the right as compared to the left. He notices that when he stops walking, the pain resolves. This pain is keeping him from being able to participate in social events and spend quality time with his family.

What is the name of the symptom the patient is experiencing?
A. Neuropathy

B. Claudication

C. Ischemic rest pain

D. Bilateral sciatica

E. Normal symptoms",B,"Claudication is defined as reproducible pain or cramping of the lower extremities that occurs with ambulation and significantly improves or resolves at rest. Claudication can occur in any muscle group distal to the area of arterial stenosis and/or occlusion. As such, the calf muscles are the most common anatomic location to experience pain as they are distal in the lower extremity. As the patient does not report pain at rest, they do not have ischemic rest pain. Neuropathic pain or bilateral sciatica and claudication can be confused. Neuropathic pain is shocking in quality whereas claudication is describes as a cramp-type pain. Furthermore, claudication is absent at rest, triggered by exercise, and relieved by a return to rest. This pattern helps distinguish claudication from neuropathic pain. This patient also does not have normal pathology, as one should not have pain on ambulation and needs to be further evaluated."

C. Duplex Ultrasound

D. Angiogram

E. Ankle-Brachial Index and Pulse Volume Recording (ABI/PVR)",E,"Ankle-Brachial Index and Pulse Volume Recording (ABI/PVR) is a non-invasive method that measures the ratio of blood pressure in the lower legs to the blood pressure in the arms. Abnormal ABIs have been shown to have high specificity with identifying PAD. Patients who have claudication usually have ABI ranges from 0.5 to 0.9. Pulse volume recordings (PVR) use pressure cuffs to record the shape of a pulse. The type of waveform provides important information about the characteristics of blood flow. Waveforms can be used to diagnose and monitor arterial diseases, assess the severity of stenosis, and determine the effectiveness of treatment interventions. This patient likely has claudication based on the history and symptoms. The first non-invasive testing to confirm the diagnosis would be ABI/PVR. While a CTA would provide helful information with regards to arterial anatomy and the extend of calcification, it cannot provide the physiologic information that one would obtains an ABI/PVR. Furthermore, CTA requires contrast and radiation exposure. While used in measuring an ABI, a Doppler probe is not nearly as sensitive in identifying PAD and does not provide data helpful in creating a management plan. A Duplex Ultrasound would provide physiologic information as to the burden of disease. However, it is highly operator dependent and requires more resources. It may be considered as a second line investigation. While an angiogram is the gold-standard, it is an invasive technique that requires the use of contrast.

Performing an ankle-brachial index (ABI) requires an appropriately sized manual blood pressure cuff and a hand-held, continuous-wave Doppler probe. The patient should be in the supine position and allowed to rest before the examination begins. The blood pressure cuff is placed above the ankle. The Doppler probe is used to locate the dorsalis pedis (DP) or posterior tibial (PT) pulse. The pressure cuff is inflated until the Doppler signal is obliterated, and then the cuff is then slowly released. The pressure at which the Doppler signal returns is the ankle pressure. The same process is repeated for both legs (DP and PT signals) and both arms. The arm pressure must be measured with the Doppler probe and the manual blood pressure cuff. To calculate an ABI, the higher ankle pressure (DP or PT) is divided by the highest arm pressure (left or right). Note that the higher arm pressure is used to calculate the ABI for both legs. For this specific case, the highest arm pressure is 150. To calculate on the right, 165/150=1.1, on the left 120/150=0.8. A normal ABI is 0.9 to 1.2. Patients with claudication usually have an ABI ranging from 0.5 to 0.9, and those with ischemic rest pain or tissue loss usually have an ABI less than 0.5.

If 3 or more toes are removed, the stability of the foot can be compromised and thus the correct amputation for him is a transmetatarsal amputation (TMA). He has adequate distal perfusion with palpable pedal pulses, and therefore, he will likely be able to heal from the amputation. A TMA will remove infected tissue and will provide him with the greatest amputation stump length. A below-knee amputation (BKA), through-knee amputation (TKA), and above-knee amputation (AKA) are too extreme for the burden of foot infection.

E.	Cellulitis",D,"Smoking. Smoking contributes to worsening peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Peripheral arterial disease results when the arteries narrow due to plaque accumulation which prevents or decreases the amount of oxygen-rich blood reaching your legs. The chemicals in tobacco products increase the rate of plaque formation in arterial walls thereby narrowing the arterial lumen. Smoking also constricts blood vessels and causes blood to clot, ultimately putting PAD patients at a higher risk of further complications such as heart attacks, limb amputations, and death.

E.        Full enhancement in the posterior tibial artery ending in the region of the medial malleolus.",C,"Enhancement in the peroneal artery contributing to pedal circulation. Because of its location in the deep compartments of the lower leg, the peroneal artery becomes the most likely artery to remain patent in diabetic patients with vascular disease. Therefore, when performing preoperative imaging to plan an infrapopliteal bypass, a more common target site for anastomosis is the peroneal artery. It is important to remember that it is necessary for the peroneal artery to have patency to the anterior or posterior tibial artery to perfuse the entire foot. Choice B is incorrect because this is more of a presentation in a patient with acute occlusion of only the popliteal artery, as in a posterior knee dislocation. Patients with vascular disease tend to have more distal vessels affected before proximal. Choice A is incorrect because the geniculate arteries themselves are collaterals. Although there is a chance that these will be affected by vasculopathy, it is unlikely that only they will be affected. D is a representation of imaging in a patient with femoral artery disease.

 Stage IIb: immediately threatened limb that is salvageable only with immediate revascularization (mild to moderate motor loss with significant sensory loss, with usually inaudible arterial signal)
 Stage III: Irreversibly damaged limb with major tissue loss or permanent nerve damage (profound motor and sensory loss, generally with paralysis and inaudible arterial signal)

An arterial embolism refers to an acute event where thrombogenic material lodges in an arterial tree, usually at a branching point. Various etiologies exist, including septic and cardiogenic sources. In a patient with atrial fibrillation, a laminated thrombus with a cardiac origin is likely the cause of his embolus. As previously mentioned, when an embolus occurs, it often becomes lodged at an arterial bifurcation, usually at a narrowed peripheral location where the arterial caliber changes. One of the more common locations for obstruction is the common femoral artery at the bifurcation of the superficial femoral artery and profunda femoris, which can lead to an acute arterial cutoff sign as seen in the computed tomography angiogram described in this case. Patients presenting with acute limb ischemia classically present with one or more of the six Ps: pulselessness, pallor, pain, paresthesia, paralysis, and poikilothermia. The man has several of these findings, making the diagnosis of an acute embolic event reasonable. The findings of buttock claudication, erectile dysfunction, and decreased femoral pulses are a classic presentation of Leriche syndrome, which is caused by chronic aortoiliac occlusive disease. Bilateral decreased foot sensation and pain is more likely seen in a patient with diabetic neuropathy and venous stasis. Reproducible calf pain that improves with rest and has decreased signals is consistent with chronic peripheral arterial disease and claudication. Lastly, a patient with loss of sensation, decreased motor function, and mottling of the skin but with palpable femoral pulses has a high likelihood of having irreversible, Rutherford III acute limb ischemia, commonly due to infrageniculate thrombosis."

14.6,case_studies,cs,lower extremity arterial disease,"A 65-year-old man presented with acute severe pain in his right leg. Medical history
revealed non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for 3 years and a myocardial
infarction (MI) some 5 years ago. The pain in the right leg developed suddenly over
6 h without associated trauma and became worse over time. On admission, the right
leg looked pale distally from the level of the knee. There was loss of light touch
sensation on examination of the foot. The patient had difficulties in wiggling the
toes. Plantarflexion and dorsiflexion of the toes were still possible. Palpation of the
calf showed soft but tender muscles. Clinical examination of the abdomen showed
no abnormalities. There was no pulsating mass. Irregular but bounding pulsations
were felt in the right femoral artery. Popliteal artery and tibial artery pulsations were
absent. Normal pulsations were felt in the left popliteal and posterior tibial artery.

With the diagnosis of acute arterial ischaemia in mind, a full dose of intravenous
heparin was administered immediately.

A chest film X-ray showed no abnormalities. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed
atrial fibrillation and signs of an old MI. Laboratory studies were normal. Duplex
examination showed a thrombotic occlusion of the right femoral bifurcation and the
superficial femoral artery. A weak flow sign was present in the popliteal artery. The
tibial arteries were not visualised.

After placement of a central venous catheter, the patient was taken to the operat-
ing theatre and the right femoral bifurcation was exposed under local anaesthesia. A transverse arteriotomy confirmed complete thrombotic occlusion of the femoral bifurcation. There was good inflow. Thrombi were removed from the femoral bifurcation, and pulsatile backflow was obtained from the profunda femoris artery. Multiple thrombi were removed from the superficial femoral artery and the popli- teal artery after several passages of Fogarty embolectomy catheters numbers 3 and 4.

Intraoperative angiography showed good patency of the superficial, popliteal and pero-
neal arteries. The anterior tibial artery was completely occluded. The posterior tibial was patent in its first portion but occluded distally. A small catheter was inserted into
the popliteal artery, and 350,000 units of urokinase were infused as a dripping infusion
over 30 min. Repeated angiography showed further clearance of the posterior tibial
artery to the level of the ankle joint. The anterior tibial artery was still occluded. It was
decided to accept the situation. The arteries were flushed with a diluted heparinised
saline solution, and the transverse arteriotomy was closed with the aid of a Dacron
patch. Sodium bicarbonate was administered intravenously before reperfusion.

Postoperatively, the foot was well vascularised and the patient was able to wiggle
his toes almost normally. Pulsations were felt in the posterior tibial artery.
Intravenous heparin was continued. Brisk diuresis was maintained with mannitol
and alkalisation of the urine. Repeated laboratory studies showed no evidence of
acidosis or hyperkalaemia.

Six hours postoperatively, the patient developed significant limb swelling with
augmentation of pain, venous hypertension and sensory impairment of the foot. A
perifibular fasciotomy to decompress all four compartments was performed under
general anaesthesia. Afterwards, the swelling subsided and the fasciotomy wound
was closed in a delayed primary fashion after 1 week.

With the pre- and peroperative diagnosis in mind, which of the following is true?

A. The patient should be placed under antiplatelet therapy postoperatively in order to prevent another episode of embolism.

B. Heparin and oral anticoagulants remain the treatment of choice during the post-operative period.

C. Subsequent investigation with regard to the source of the embolus is not necessary, because this will not change the medical treatment.

D. Postoperative investigation with regard to the source of embolism can be limited to cardiac examinations such as echocardiography and Holter monitoring.",B,

revealed an injury to the patient 's right hand; no other significant injuries were pres-
ent. The patient was transferred to the operating theatre.

In the operating theatre, under general anaesthesia, the patient was placed in the
supine position. The lower abdomen and both legs were prepared and draped widely
and IV broad spectrum antibiotics were administered. Closer examination revealed
that the left leg had sustained extensive injuries. The foot and distal calf were cold,
pale and mottled. There was a compound injury to the left femur and tibia with
complete disruption of the superficial femoral artery, superficial femoral vein and
extensive injury to the sciatic nerve. It was decided that primary amputation of the
left limb was required. On examination of the right leg there was complete disrup-
tion of the distal superficial/popliteal artery, a ragged laceration of the popliteal vein
and significant bruising to branches of the sciatic nerve. There was a shrapnel injury
to the right hand involving the thumb and middle finger.

Immediate surgical steps were as follows: (a) a proximal thigh tourniquet was
placed on the left leg to arrest haemorrhage prior to formal amputation. The lacera-
tion to the right lower leg was then extended distally to facilitate exposure of the
neurovascular structures. Control of the superficial femoral and below-knee popli-
teal artery was obtained and a careful distal embolectomy performed. A Javid shunt
was then placed between the right superficial femoral artery and right below-knee
popliteal vessel. Significant bleeding from a large defect in the popliteal
vein occurred following shunt insertion; this was repaired using a lateral suture. The
long saphenous vein was harvested from the left leg, prior to performing above-
knee amputation. While the left above-knee amputation was being performed, the
orthopaedic surgeons carefully assessed the right lower limb and placed a tempo-
rary fixation device traversing the right knee joint. Having obtained bony stability, with an external fixator device, the temporary intraluminal shunt was
removed and a definitive bypass performed using reversed left long saphenous vein graft. Formal fasciotomy was performed of the right lower leg using a standard lat-
eral and medial approach; distal pulses were confirmed in the right foot. Further debridement of necrotic muscle was performed and the wound on the medial aspect
was partially closed; the anterolateral wounds were debrided and irrigated, as were
the fasciotomy sites, with sterile dressings being applied to both.

clinic complaining of left calf heaviness from walking 100 yards. Medical
history includes coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes and obesity.
He cannot recall details but states that his last intervention was approximately
3 years ago at another institution. He tells you that he has previously tried
cilostazol but stopped taking it due to pedal edema and gastric upset.
On your physical examination both femoral pulses are palpable, the popli-
teal pulses are difficult to palpate due to habitus and the left pedal pulses are
appreciable by hand-held Doppler only. You order a bilateral US Duplex arte-
rial study. The study reports restenosis in the left SFA. As the patient is
severely symptomatic you proceed with invasive angiography.

Which of the following statements is NOT correct?
A. The SFA stented segment is occluded with collateral flow through the profunda femoris.
B. There is evidence of stent fracture.
C. The anterior tibial artery is occluded.
D. The reconstitution point is at the tibioproneal trunk.",D,

Discussion with the patient occurred pre-procedurally in the office setting. She
was offered concomitant intervention if deemed appropriate at the time and informed
consent was obtained. The patient was given appropriate sedation and anticoagu-
lated with heparin. The diagnostic 5Fr sheath was exchanged for a 6Fr RDC angled
guiding sheath. Cannulation of the contralateral common iliac was performed with
the aid of a SOS catheter and 0.035 stiff hydrophilic guidewire under constant fluo-
roscopic guidance. The sheath was advanced to the right external iliac artery.
Roadmap techniques and small amounts of contrast were used to cross the SFA
lesions. An angled, hydrophilic coated 5Fr catheter was employed to assist in cross-
ing the stenoses. The tip of the guidewire was placed in the distal popliteal artery. A
5 mm × 4 cm cryoplasty balloon was inflated at each diseased area with an adequate
angiographic appearance and no evidence of dissection or other complication.
Next, the 0.035 guidewire was exchanged for a 0.014 exchange length guidewire
and the lesions in the anterior tibial artery were crossed. The stenoses were treated
with a 2.5 mm × 5 cm balloon with good results and no complications (Fig. 21.5).
The sheath was partially withdrawn and the left femoral artery was imaged. The
access site was felt to be adequate for an arterial closure device which was placed
without complication. The heparin was not reversed.Following treatment, her post procedure anterior tibial ankle waveform was mul-
tiphasic. Her ulcer improved with a reduction in diameter, however the first metatar-
sal head was exposed. The patient underwent right first toe transmetatarsal amputation 2 weeks later which healed nicely. Six months later, routine lower
extremity arterial non-invasive testing showed a flat right ankle PVR. The patient
denied new ulceration or rest pain.

diabetic, with well controlled hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. She
denied any history suggestive of cerebro-vascular events and not known to
suffer from ischaemic heart disease. She stopped smoking 10 years ago. She
is on best medical therapy including aspirin, antihypertensive medication and
a statin. Five years earlier she underwent an above knee femero-popliteal
bypass for similar problems using her left greater saphenous vein after a failed
angioplasty attempt. She was discharged a year after completing a success-
ful duplex graft surveillance program. Her right greater and lesser saphenous
veins were treated with stripping and multiple phlebectomies for symptomatic
varicose veins when she was 30-years old. She has tried Cilostazol in the past
but without clinical improvement. She continues to exercise regularly but her
walking distance has continued to decrease.
On examination, she had a full complement of regular pulses in her neck and
arms without any bruits. The scars of her previous left femero-popliteal bypass
could be seen as well as her varicose vein surgery on the right leg. Groin femo-

or pedal arteries. On the right side a popliteal pulse could be easily felt but the
pedal pulses were not palpable. Laboratory studies have excluded underlying
thrombophilia disorder that could explain her graft failure.

previous myocardial infarction 3 years previously with subsequent coronary
angioplasty and stenting. He is a life long smoker, but rarely takes any alco-
hol. His symptomatic claudication arises after walking for approximately
200 m on the level. He is receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibi-
tor (ACE-I), which, according to the General Practitioner 's letter, was com-
menced about 2 months before referral, and he also receives a diuretic and a
calcium antagonist at full dosage to optimize his blood pressure. On examina-
tion he is noted to have bilateral ilio-femoral bruits but palpable pedal pulses.
His blood pressure remains sub-optimally controlled at 170/90 mmHg. He is
commenced on an alpha-blocker (Doxazosin). Following the clinic visit you review his blood results and notice that there
has been a deterioration in his renal function with the serum creatinine increas-
ing from 120 to 180 μmol/L and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
decreasing from 58 to 36 mL/min since the time of referral.

In this patient, magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse aorto-iliac disease.
There was a 90% stenosis with post stenotic dilatation at the ostium of the left renal
artery and the kidney was 10 cm in length. On the right hand side there were two
renal arteries, the smaller of these exhibited a 50% renal artery stenosis (RAS). The
kidney measured 11 cm in length. In view of the deterioration in renal function and the poorly controlled hyperten-
sion it is decided to stop the ACE-inhibitor and to proceed to intervention.

The patient underwent percutaneous angioplasty with bare-metal stent place-
ment in the left renal artery. The right renal artery was not amenable to endovascular
intervention. The procedure progressed without complications and the patient was
sent home the day after treatment in good condition. He was reviewed again after 2 weeks at which stage his creatinine had improved to 140 μmol/L (eGFR 49 mL/min). His blood pressure (165/90) control had
improved to some extent.

Which of the following would be most appropriate for his future management?
A. Regular clinic review with attention to medical control of blood pressure, and vasculoprotective therapy
B. Repeat renal artery imaging with possible repeat left renal artery stenting
C. Right renal artery PTA and stenting
D. Surgical revascularization of the left kidney",A,

severe abdominal pain. Abdominal pain developed 4 days prior and he had
been hospitalized at another hospital. The abdominal pain was severe (numeric
rating scale, 8/10), and included steady epigastric pain that had lasted for 5 h
before pain killer administration at the hospital. Thereafter he suffered from
epigastric discomfort, in particular after meals. He was a social drinker and
quit smoking 4 years prior after 30 years of cigarette smoking. There was no
recent history of peptic ulcer symptoms, heavy alcohol drinking, blunt
abdominal trauma, arrhythmia or past history of abdominal surgery, or aortic
angiography. Vital signs at the time of initial presentation were blood pressure (BP) of
135/93 mmHg (not on antihypertensive medication), pulse rate (PR) of 73/

the bulb of the internal carotid artery, which went a short distance beyond the bulb
into the internal carotid artery distally. Beyond this point, the vessel was circumfer-

tal pulse was noted. Since the patient had experienced only transient symptoms and
not a completed stroke, it was our plan to use an internal shunt only if there were
electroencephalogram (EEG) changes with trial clamping. A bolus of 5000 units of
heparin was administered, and the internal, external and common carotid arteries
were clamped. The EEG was observed: there were no changes. The amplitude and
frequency of the EEG wave form were maintained. A longitudinal arteriotomy was
made in the common carotid artery and extended through a very tight carotid steno-
sis. The plaque within the carotid bulb showed evidence of recent intraplaque haem-
orrhage. As we passed through the plaque, we emerged into an unencumbered
internal carotid artery distally. A bifurcation endarterectomy was then performed
with clean endpoints in the internal, external and common carotid arteries. The
intimectomised surface was then irrigated with heparinised saline, and small bits of
medial debris were removed carefully. The intimal endpoint was adherent to the
media. Once we were satisfied that there was no evidence of intimal flap and all of
the loose bits of medial debris were removed, attention was turned to closure.

Closure of the arteriotomy should be:
A. A primary, carefully placed closure with 6-0 prolene
B. Closure with a patch angioplasty

34.6,case_studies,cs,carotid disorders,"A 72-year-old white male was referred for evaluation and management fol-
lowing the finding of an asymptomatic carotid bruit, picked up on routine
physical examination by his primary-care physician. The patient was asymp-
tomatic with respect to ocular or hemispheric ischaemic events. His risk fac-
tors included a 30-year history of smoking one pack of cigarettes a day, which
he quit a year ago. He had hypertension that was controlled well by two drugs.
He had no history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, or symptoms
of peripheral vascular disease. On physical examination, his temporal pulses
were equal. His carotid pulses were full and equal, but there was a loud bruit
over the right carotid bifurcation. His femoral, popliteal, dorsalis paedis and
posterior tibial pulses were normally palpable bilaterally.

The patient underwent a bilateral carotid duplex scan. The scan demon-
strated a category 60-79% right carotid bulb stenosis. The plaque characteristic was
one of mixed consistency, a mildly irregular surface, and minimal calcification. The
left carotid bulb showed a category 20-59% stenosis. Both vertebral arteries were
imaged with normal antegrade flow velocities.


The patient was placed on aspirin antiplatelet therapy, begun on a statin,
counseled regarding the importance of good blood pressure control including the
use of a beta blocker or ACE inhibitor, and given an appointment for a return visit
in 6 months time for a repeat carotid duplex scan to see whether there was any evi-
dence of progression. The patient was also counseled regarding the importance of
calling the vascular service should he develop ocular or hemispheric transient isch-
aemic attacks within the 6-month interval before his return appointment.
The patient did quite well for the next 4 months; then one afternoon, he noted the
onset of an episode of numbness and weakness of his left hand. The hand was not
totally paralyzed, but it was clearly numb, weak and uncoordinated. This cleared
completely within a period of 10 min. The patient thought that this might have been
related to his arm position and chose to do nothing further until the next day, when
the same event occurred. At this point, he called his physician and was advised to
return immediately. An emergent carotid duplex scan was ordered. The scan now
showed progression to a category 80-99% stenosis with plaque once again of mixed
consistency.

The patient now had two clear indications for proceeding with carotid endarter-
ectomy: the onset of symptoms in the territory of the carotid lesion, and progression
of the lesion to an 80-99% stenosis. Two additional decisions also had to be consid-
ered: the timing of operation and whether brain imaging was indicated. In view of
the fact that the patient had an appropriate carotid artery lesion, and the symptoms
were typical for hemispheric transient ischaemic events in the distribution of the
carotid lesion, information gained from brain imaging such as computed tomogra-
phy (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would be of limited value.
Therefore, the cost/benefit ratio for brain imaging was clearly unfavorable. The
timing of carotid endarterectomy was urgent. The patient had a new onset of tran-
sient ischaemic attacks and evidence of plaque progression. Therefore, the patient
was now at highest risk of a hemispheric stroke. The optimum management for this
patient would be emergent admission to the hospital and rapid evaluation for opera-
tion, including the patient 's cardiac status. While this was taking place, it
would be appropriate to start the patient on intravenous heparin anticoagulation.
Once cleared from a cardiac standpoint, plans should be made to proceed with oper-
ation either that day or the next morning.

The patient was admitted as an emergency to the hospital and started on intrave-
nous heparin with a loading dose of 5000 units and a continuing dose of 1000 units/h.
He was seen in cardiology consultation, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained
and a stress-echo study was performed. In the absence of any symptoms of coronary
disease, a relatively normal ECG, and a stress-echo study showing a 55% ejection
fraction, the patient was cleared for operation.

The patient was taken to the operating room the next morning. Before this, EEG
electrodes were placed for intraoperative monitoring. An arterial line was placed for
blood pressure monitoring, and general anaesthesia was administered. A vertical
incision along the anterior border of the sternomastoid muscle was made. The facial
vein was divided, and the common carotid, carotid bifurcation, internal and external
carotid arteries were fully mobilized. There was a posterior plaque present in the
common carotid artery, which was nonocclusive. The major plaque build-up was in
the bulb of the internal carotid artery, which went a short distance beyond the bulb
into the internal carotid artery distally. Beyond this point, the vessel was circumfer-
entially soft. The distal internal carotid artery was somewhat collapsed, and no dis-
tal pulse was noted. Since the patient had experienced only transient symptoms and
not a completed stroke, it was our plan to use an internal shunt only if there were
electroencephalogram (EEG) changes with trial clamping. A bolus of 5000 units of
heparin was administered, and the internal, external and common carotid arteries
were clamped. The EEG was observed: there were no changes. The amplitude and
frequency of the EEG wave form were maintained. A longitudinal arteriotomy was
made in the common carotid artery and extended through a very tight carotid steno-
sis. The plaque within the carotid bulb showed evidence of recent intraplaque haem-
orrhage. As we passed through the plaque, we emerged into an unencumbered
internal carotid artery distally. A bifurcation endarterectomy was then performed
with clean endpoints in the internal, external and common carotid arteries. The
intimectomised surface was then irrigated with heparinised saline, and small bits of
medial debris were removed carefully. The intimal endpoint was adherent to the
media. Once we were satisfied that there was no evidence of intimal flap and all of
the loose bits of medial debris were removed, attention was turned to closure.

The patient 's arteriotomy was closed with a patch angioplasty using a collagen-
impregnated knitted Dacron patch that was cut to length and beveled at each end.
Upon completion of the closure, blood flow was begun first to the external then to the
internal carotid artery. Excellent pulsation in all vessels was noted. We then carried
out a completion angiogram by placing a small needle in the patch and injecting con-
trast into the carotid bifurcation using a portable cine-fluoro unit. The carotid bifurca-
tion was imaged, and there was an excellent technical result with no evidence of
residual stenosis or intimal flap. Intracranial imaging was also carried out, and excel-
lent flow into the carotid siphon and the anterior and middle cerebral arteries was
confirmed. After meticulous haemostasis was achieved, a 7.0-mm Jackson Pratt drain
was placed in the wound and brought out through a separate stab wound. The platys-
mal layer was closed with an absorbable suture, and the skin was closed with a subcu-
ticular absorbable suture. An adhesive plastic dressing was applied directly to the
skin, and the patient was returned to the recovery room. The patient awoke at his
neurological baseline with no evidence of cerebral or cranial nerve deficit. His blood
pressure was monitored carefully and was noted to be stable at 150/80 mmHg.

After an appropriate stay in the recovery room, to where should the patient be
transferred?
A. An intensive care unit with continual monitoring overnight

presumably as a result of external compression. Aspiration of the perigraft collec-
tion would have allowed preoperative bacterial culture but was considered to be too
difficult to perform safely.

In situ replacement with autologous vein was chosen because of the reduced risk
of persistent infection.Femoropopliteal vein was used as it is ideally suited to supra-inguinal graft
replacement as it is relatively thick-walled, is of adequate diameter and has suffi-
cient length.

A duplex scan of the femoral veins confirmed that they were patent and of ade-
quate calibre. The patient was operated on electively on the next available operating
list.

Routine blood investigations, chest X-ray and ECG were all performed, and in
view of the magnitude of the procedure, echocardiogram and lung function tests
were also ordered. They were all satisfactory. Because the bacteriology of the infec-
tion was not known preoperatively in this patient, intravenous combination antibac-
terial therapy with teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin, co-amoxiclav and metronidazole was
given immediately before surgery.

The anaesthetised patient was catheterised, prepared and draped so that the
abdomen and both legs were exposed. First, both superficial femoral veins were
simultaneously dissected out by two operative teams and the branches divided
between clips from the profunda femoris vein to the knee joint. The femoral veins
were left in situ whilst the abdomen was opened, exposing the graft and obtaining
control of the proximal infrarenal aorta and the right common iliac bifurcation.
The graft was encased in fibrous tissue, making dissection difficult and hazardous.
The underlying prosthesis showed poor tissue incorporation and there was a local-
ised abscess between the graft and the duodenum, which was evacuated and cul-
tured. The left groin was exposed, obtaining control of the common femoral
artery, its branches and the profunda femoris artery. After systemic heparinisation,
the vessels were clamped and the infected graft excised and sent for culture. The
graft bed was washed repeatedly with povidone iodine and hydrogen peroxide.

One femoral vein was excised, reversed and inserted end-to-end from the infrare-
nal aorta to the right common iliac artery bifurcation using 4/0 polypropylene
sutures. Size discrepancy at the aortic anastomosis was overcome by ""fishmouth-
ing"" the end of the vein to prevent the angulation associated with spatulation. The other femoral vein was reversed and anastomosed end to side to
the intra-abdominal part of the vein graft and to the left common femoral artery. Both veins were led through a fresh tunnel and surrounded by greater
momentum to avoid contact with the bed of the infected graft. The arterial anasto-
moses were covered by gentamicin-impregnated collagen foam and the wounds
were closed with suction drainage. Antibiotic prophylaxis and low molecular
weight heparin were continued postoperatively. Despite the copious pus around
the graft, no organisms were grown in the laboratory. Combination antibiotic ther-
apy was stopped after 7 days but co-amoxiclav was continued empirically for a
further 5 weeks

Exposed grafts present a difficult problem for achieving skin closure and the
addition of a local muscle flap in the groin to graft replacement with autologous
(femoropopliteal) vein is the most certain method of cure. The author 's preference
is a rectus femoris flap for this.

The patient had the most common complication of this operation, which was a
large seroma in the left thigh and a smaller one in the right thigh despite prolonged
suction drainage. These were aspirated repeatedly and resolved after 3 weeks,
although in other cases reoperation and reinsertion of a drain may be required.
Intestinal obstruction is no more common following this operation than other
abdominal procedures.
The patient otherwise made a good recovery and was discharged from hospital
at 14 days. The graft and pus swabs were sterile so most of the antibiotics were
stopped at 1 week but the co-amoxiclav was continued for 6 weeks on empirical
grounds.

tion for a couple of years. Her walking distance had gradually decreased to
around 50-100 m. She had previously been healthy and very active. At inves-
tigation, she had no femoral pulses and a bilateral ankle brachial index of 0.6.
Further evaluation with angiography showed an aortic occlusion at the level
of the renal arteries, and she was reconstructed with an aorto-bi-iliac polyester
graft (16 × 8 mm) after local proximal aortic endarterectomy. The proximal
anastomosis was made end to end, and the iliac end to side. Polypropylene
sutures were used. The operation was somewhat technically difficult, with the
proximal anastomosis having to be redone; the duration of surgery was 3.5 h
with a blood loss of around 800 mL. The immediate postoperative course was
uneventful. After 3 years, the patient had distal septic microembolization in
the left leg with an abscess around the left distal graft limb. This was extir-
pated, the wound was drained and a femoral-femoral cross-over graft was
inserted. She was put on antibiotics for 6 months.
Five years after the aortic operation, she had melaena and a decrease in
hemoglobin.

The patient was investigated at her primary health care centre with gastroscopy
and colon enema, with negative results. After 2 months, she again had melaena;
after further melaena 3 months later, she was referred to the hospital. On this occa-
sion, she also had slight back pain and low-grade fewer.

A gastroscopy showed a very distal duodenal ""ulcer"" with a green colored (bile
stained) graft in the bottom.  A computed tomography (CT) scan showed
fluid around the proximal part of the graft, with some gas bubbles.

Following a diagnosis of a secondary aortoenteric fistula, and with the patient
being circulatory stable, an axillo-bifemoral polyester graft was inserted. During the
same period of anesthesia, the old aortic graft was extirpated. A duodenorraphy was
made, and the aortic stump, which was about 2 cm below the renal arteries, was
sutured and covered with omental tissue.

43.ten,case_studies,cs,venuous disease,"A 42-year-old type 1 diabetic of normal weight has recently progressed to
chronic renal disease. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM) has been
managed by the same primary care physician for the preceding 12 years; glu-
cose control has never been a problem in this cooperative and well-educated
individual. The renal failure was initially managed with appropriate adjust-
ments to diet and medications; the presumptive diagnosis is diabetic nephrop-
athy. Recent laboratory tests demonstrate a creatinine of 4.1, a blood urea
nitrogen of 94, a potassium of 4.8, mild proteinuria, and a creatinine clearance
of 20 mL/min.

A nephrology work-up finds no reversible cause and the patient 's immune status
precludes any further consideration of transplantation. The patient is referred for
construction of a hemoaccess.

The patient is right hand dominant.
Right: Cephalic (diameter 3.3 mm) and basilic (diameter 3.5 mm) veins course
through both the forearm and upper arm to their junctions with the axillary and bra-
chial veins respectively; however, both superficial forearm veins demonstrate post-
thrombotic changes in the forearm. The brachial artery (diameter 4.2 mm) bifurcates
into a radial (diameter 2.8 mm) and ulnar (diameter 2.7 mm) artery 3 cm below the
antecubital crease; the palmar arches are intact. The deep venous structures are normal
from the forearm veins through visualization of the axillary and subclavian veins.
Left: The basilic vein is post-thrombotic and thickened in the forearm; it has a
normal 3.5-mm diameter lumen just below the elbow continuing into its junction
with the brachial vein at mid-humerus. The cephalic vein (diameter 3.5 mm) has a
normal luminal surface, extends to the wrist, is superficial, communicates with the
proximal basilic at the antecubital junction, and remains patent into its junction with
the axillary vein. The brachial artery (diameter 4.2 mm) bifurcates into a radial
(diameter 2.8 mm) and ulnar (diameter 2.7 mm) artery at mid-humerus; the palmar
arches are intact. The deep venous structures are normal from the forearm veins
through visualization of the axillary and subclavian veins.

Your initial hemoaccess has functioned well for 6.4 years, but the hemodialysis
staff has noted increasing difficulty obtaining adequate flows for the external
machine circuit; arterial pressures were low at 70 mm Hg and venous pressures
elevated to 350 mm Hg. You are asked to consider revision or a new hemoaccess.
A new duplex examination demonstrates progressive stenosis of the distal radial
artery, and multiple sites of localized thrombosis extending into the upper arm
cephalic vein. You determine that there is no role for angioplasty of the lengthy arte-
rial stenosis or the multiple venous lesions.

A new hemoaccess is constructed and an excellent thrill achieved. During initial
maturation, hemodialysis is continued via the original left arm hemoaccess.
Fortunately, the original left hemoaccess provides sufficient flow for adequate inter-
val hemodialysis, but 6 weeks later has spontaneously thrombosed. Dialysis using
the new hemoaccess is successful and the hemoaccess functions well for thrice
weekly puncture.Two years later you are again contacted to evaluate this individual. One year
previously, an uneventful coronary bypass was performed. Subsequently, following
an episode of syncope, and tachyarrhythmia, a permanent defibrillator was installed
on the left anterior chest wall 2 months ago.
The patient is complaining of an obviously swollen left arm.

All of the interventions aimed at reducing the left arm edema are unsuccessful,
and the patient is discharged home. After multiple attempts, the dialysis staff reluc-
tantly admit they are no longer able to reliably cannulate the left arm AVF. You are
again asked to consider revision or a new hemoaccess.
A new DU is obtained. The appropriate postoperative findings are noted; otherwise,
the relevant arm anatomy is unchanged from the initial survey

The left arm symptoms resolve, and the new access functions well for 2.6 addi-
tional years. However, dilation begins to appear in two sites most commonly used
for the tri-weekly puncture for hemodialysis. Duplex examination of the larger dis-
cerns the presence of a large pseudoaneurysm with a 0.6-mm neck communicating
with the lumen of hemoaccess. The individual reports several recent episodes of
prolonged difficulty achieving hemostasis after removal of the access needles.
During duplex interrogation, a thrombotic plug is dislodged. Pulsatile bleeding
ensues, which is controlled with 30-45 min of direct compression.

The best treatment option at this time is which of the following?
A. Ligation of the hemoaccess.

This patient underwent a thorough investigation of the nature and extent of the con-
genital vascular malformation (CVM) involved.
A combination of various non- to minimally-invasive studies were performed to
confirm the clinical impression of venolymphatic malformation (VLM): duplex
ultrasonography, whole-body blood-pool scintigraphy (WBBPS), magnetic reso-
nance image (MRI) study, transarterial lung perfusion scintigraphy (TLPS), and/or
radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy.
The primary hemodynamic impact and the secondary musculoskeletal impact of
the venous malformation (VM) were assessed as the main CVM lesion in addition
to the extent/degree of each component of the VM, truncular (T) and extratruncular
(ET) form, involved in the extremity.
A thorough skeletal evaluation of the long-bone growth discrepancy of the lower
extremity and the degree of pelvic tilt with its compensatory scoliosis was also
made with conventional bone X-rays.
The TLPS assessment was performed substituting arteriographic investigation of
the lower extremity for the possible hidden micro-arteriovenous malformation
(AVM) lesion, which was marginally indicated due to an unusually increased venous
flow by the isolated VM lesion alone on the duplex scan under the normally devel-
oped and functioning deep vein system.

An ascending phlebography was also performed together with the percutaneous
direct-puncture phlebography as a therapeutic guide; mandatory confirmation of the
presence of a normal deep vein system of the lower extremity was made before
starting the treatment to the infiltrating ET-form lesion of the VM.
The final diagnosis confirmed extensive involvement of the VM as an infiltrating
type of the ET form causing serious clinical impact directly to the venous system
hemodynamically as well as to the skeletal system to induce abnormal long-bone
growth of the left lower extremity. A moderate degree of venectasia as a T form of
VM along the left femoral-popliteal vein segment was also found, by WBBPS, MRI
and duplex scan, and subsequently confirmed by separate ascending phlebography.

A venectasia of the femoral vein was assessed to have a limited clinical signifi-
cance at this stage in comparison to the ET-form lesions of the VM.
The lymphatic malformation (LM) component which is mixed with the ET form of
VM, was confirmed as the ET form, giving minimum and limited clinical impact so
that a conservative management/observation was instituted for this LM component.
Therefore, the ET-form lesions of VM along the knee region were selected for
active treatment as a priority; this was followed by the ankle and foot lesions.
The primary indication to initiate the treatment immediately was that these
lesions were potentially limb-threatening (e.g., hemarthrosis) due to their proximity
to the joints with increased vulnerability to repeated trauma, especially as a cause of
her knee symptoms.
The treatment was further indicated to arrest/slow down their impact on abnor-
mal long-bone growth.
Multiple infiltrating ET lesions of the VM along the knee region, which is surgi-
cally not amenable, were selected for ethanol sclerotherapy as independent therapy.
Multisession ethanol sclerotherapy was given using the absolute ethanol in the range
of 80 to 100% concentration in calculated dosage not exceeding 1.0 mg/kg of body
weight as maximum dose per session by direct puncture technique under general
anesthesia. Close cardiopulmonary monitoring during the procedure was ensured to
control and/or prevent transient pulmonary hypertension by the unavoidable spillage
of ethanol into the systemic circulation from the lesion during treatment.
The symptomatic lesions along the knee with recurrent painful swelling following
minor injuries were controlled well without complication/morbidity and substantially
reduced the risk of intra-articular bleeding and subsequent hemarthrosis. Subsequently,
the ET-form VM lesions at the foot and ankle underwent surgical excision following
preoperative multisession ethanol and N-butyl cyanoacrylic glue embolosclerother-
apy with much reduced perioperative morbidity to improve foot function.

Following successful control of multiple VM lesions along the knee, ankle, and
foot with priority as a potentially limb-threatening condition, other VM lesions,
scattered throughout the lower extremity, were also treated with absolute ethanol to
assist further attempts to arrest the abnormal long-bone growth of the lower extrem-
ity. The abnormal long-bone growth is attributed to these VM lesions scattered
within the muscular structure of the lower extremity in the extensive infiltrating type
of ET, with significant impact on the venous circulation along the epiphyseal plate.
In addition to the multisession embolosclerotherapy as independent and/or adjunct
perioperative therapy to the VM lesions, the conservative supportive measures to
improve and/or maintain overall venous function have been supplemented with the use
of a graded compression above-knee stocking to prevent chronic venous insufficiency.
The final decision for the T-form lesion was left femoral-popliteal venectasia, but
it was decided to defer treatment until urgent treatment of the ET form of the VM
was finished, but to keep it under close observation. It might eventually require
treatment (e.g., venorrhaphy, venous bypass) to prevent development of venous
thromboembolism when significant venous flow/volume reduction should occur
following successful control of the ET form of VM lesions. The hemodynamic con-
sequences of the treatment of such extensive ET-form lesions directly affect total
venous blood volume through the deep vein system.
The LM component in this patient was treated only with complex decongestive
therapy (CDT) in order to prevent full development of lymphedema. The infiltrating
ET form of LM detected together with the ET form of VM has been shown to put extra
burden on the marginally normal lymph-conducting system on lymphoscinti-graphic
evaluation. Therefore, continuous surveillance for aggressive preventive measurement
of local to systemic cellulitis along this ET form of LM lesions is mandated.
This patient will continue to be managed by the multidisciplinary team of the
CVM Clinic at regular intervals for her entire lifetime, through periodical follow-up
assessment of the treatment results and the natural course of the untreated lesions.

compressive dressings at a hospital wound care center. Ulcers in the same general
area had occurred intermittently in the past but had healed with local wound care
and dressings. The ulcer was very painful, particularly with dependency of the leg
(7/10 over a visual analogue scale) and frequently at night. The patient had made
a habit of elevating her legs during the day whenever feasible, and to sleep with
her legs elevated on a pillow at night. She had been using a nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drug once or twice a day at work for pain relief, but lately a narcotic
prescribed by her physician was required for sleep at night. Even so, on some
nights, she had to ""walk off"" the pain for 20-30 min before she could fall asleep.
Past medical history: She had been hospitalized on two occasions during the
past year for cellulitis of the leg, which required intravenous antibiotics. Her
saphenous vein was stripped 15 years ago when the ulcer initially appeared.
This resulted in healing of the ulcer but it recurred 2 years later. During adoles-
cence, she sustained a closed tibial fracture of the same extremity during a ski
accident and was in a plaster cast and crutches for several weeks. Family his-
tory: No one in the family had varicose veins or deep venous thrombosis.

could be followed over both great saphenous veins (GSV) down the thigh. A
possible minimal reflux was also noted in the popliteal fossa on the right side,
although it was difficult to confirm this when the Doppler examination was
repeated. Foot arteries were palpable on the dorsum of the foot on both sides.

pressure 130 in both legs and right arm. Duplex ultrasound scanning of the venous
system performed with the patient in 60° reversed-Trendelenburg position, using
pneumatic cuff with automatic inflation/release on the lower leg to evaluate the
reflux, showed bilateral reflux in the GSV, from the common femoral vein down to
below knee, as well as two incompetent perforator veins on the medial aspect of
the right calf with a diameter of 4 mm. The diameter of the GSV at the groin was
12 mm on the right side and 9 mm on the left side. The reflux time exceeded 4 s in
both GSV, with peak reverse flow velocity more than 30 cm/s. Reflux less than
0.5 s was noted in the lesser saphenous vein on right side. No reflux was present in
the deep veins except for minimal reflux in the common femoral vein with reflux
duration of approximately 1 s on the right side. There were no signs of post-throm-
botic changes.

were aggravated by standing and walking. She also reported diffuse swelling
of the entire left limb and mild redness. There was minimal relief at home
with ice packs and leg elevation. She denied fever, chills, chest pain, shortness
of breath, diaphoresis, back pain, leg weakness, tingling or numbness. There
was no history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), thrombophilia, bleeding
disorders, malignancy or recent trauma. Her medical history includes severe
osteoporosis, mitral valve prolapse, breast fibroadenoma, and benign liver

extension into the left external iliac vein. The inferior vena cava, left common
iliac, and internal iliac veins were patent.
A diagnosis of provoked proximal acute DVT of the left lower extremity was
made. Recent surgery and use of raloxifene were considered inciting factors.

Raloxifene was discontinued and anticoagulation was initiated with unfractioned
heparin drip, which was titrated to an activated thromboplastin time of 60-90 s.
Different treatment options were discussed with the patient, including anticoagu-
lation, venous thrombectomy and thrombolysis with venous angioplasty and stent-
ing if necessary. There were no contraindications for thrombolysis and the patient
consented to proceed with treatment.
Two days after the onset of her symptoms, the left popliteal vein was accessed
with ultrasound guidance and a venogram was performed. Venography showed a
patent left femoral vein with no evidence of thrombus. The left common femoral
vein was occluded with collaterals seen proximally. The left external iliac and com-
mon iliac veins were also occluded with cross-over collaterals to the right iliac
system. A thrombus extending approximately 2-3 cm into the IVC was also seen
.Due to the thrombus extension into the IVC, the decision was taken to perform
CDT without mechanical thrombectomy. Utilizing an angled Glidewire (Terumo
Medical Corporation, Somerset, New Jersey) and angled glide catheter (Terumo
Medical corporation, Somerset, New Jersey) the occlusion was transverse. The
angled glide catheter was removed and a 5F Uni-Fuse 30 cm infusion catheter
(AngioDynamics, Latham, New York) was inserted over the wire and positioned
within the thrombus from the distal IVC to the common femoral vein. The thrombus
was pulse-sprayed with 8 mg of t-PA and a t-PA infusion was initiated at 1 mg per
hour. Heparin was infused through the side flush of the 7-French sheath at
500 units/h. The sheath as well as the catheter were secured to the posterior aspect
of the popliteal fossa.
After 24 h on CDT, a follow-up venogram was performed.

Venography showed a widely open femoral vein with areas of spasm and some
residual thrombus into the left external iliac vein. Residual thrombus was present in
the common iliac vein with collateral flow through cross pelvic veins as well as into
the ascending lumbar vein. The venographic findings suggested
a proximal left common iliac vein obstruction. An intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)
was performed from the level of the access site to the mid IVC using a 0.035 IVUS
catheter (Philips Volcano, San Diego, California). The femoral vein was small in
size with no evidence of thrombus. There was residual thrombus within the proxi-
mal common femoral, distal external iliac and common iliac veins. A stenotic seg-
ment >50% was found in the proximal left common iliac vein where the right
common iliac artery was crossing over with residual thrombus. There appeared also
to be some narrowing (<50%) within the proximal external iliac vein.

An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) using the proximal saphenous vein anastomosed
to the superficial femoral artery increases flow velocity through the iliofemoral
venous system, reducing the risk of rethrombosis. A thrombectomy of the proximal
great saphenous vein was required in this patient, as is often the case. Since the goal
of the AVF is to increase venous blood flow velocity, the size of the anastomosis is
limited to 3.5-4 mm in order to avoid a steal and avoid venous hypertension. A
small piece of PTFE is wrapped around the saphenous AVF and looped with a 2-cm
piece of O-Prolene, which is left in the subcutaneous tissue. This will
serve as a guide should the AVF require closure.
However, since the AVF is small, it is considered permanent and closure is not
anticipated. To further reduce the risk of rethrombosis, a heparin infusion catheter
(pediatric feeding tube) is placed into the proximal posterior tibial vein and brought
out through a separate stab wound adjacent to the lower leg incision. Infusing unfrac-
tionated heparin through this catheter to achieve a therapeutic PTT ensures a high
concentration of heparin in the target vein, a concentration much higher than would be
achieved if the patient was treated with standard intravenous anticoagulation through
an arm vein. A monofilament suture is looped around the catheter in the posterior
tibial vein and brought out through the skin and secured with a sterile button. This is
used to occlude the vein after 5-6 days when the catheter is removed following full
oral anticoagulation with warfarin. In the case of this pregnant patient, intravenous
anticoagulation through the leg veins was maintained for 4 days, after which she was
converted to subcutaneous enoxaparin at 1 mg/kg every 12 h. The catheter was

neck symptoms. In the year 2000 he was diagnosed with anaplastic large cell
lymphoma of the neck and axillae. He was treated with 6 cycles of chemo-
therapy. Five separate Hickman lines were used, three were right sided and two
were left sided. Over the years he developed worsening exercise tolerance and
gradually he became unable to perform the physical demands of his job. He
complained of dull headaches, he developed worsening fascial and neck swell-
ing and on three different occasions he had epistaxis. Bending forward for
5-10 min after manual exercise, precipitated presyncopal symptoms and on
two occasions he lost consciousness. For the last 6 months prior to his outpa-
tient visit he stopped working because of the severity of his symptoms. On
examination the patient had a plythoric engorged face. There were varicose
veins visible over the sternum and the right anterior axillary line. There were
also scars on the anterior chest wall from previous Hickman line insertions.
