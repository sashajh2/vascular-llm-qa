ABSTRACT
The Society for Vascular Surgery, the American Venous Forum, and the American Vein and Lymphatic Society recently
published Part I of the 2022 clinical practice guidelines on varicose veins. Recommendations were based on the latest
scientiﬁc evidence researched following an independent systematic review and meta-analysis of ﬁve critical issues
affecting the management of patients with lower extremity varicose veins, using the patients, interventions, comparators,
and outcome system to answer critical questions. Part I discussed the role of duplex ultrasound scanning in the evaluation of varicose veins and treatment of superﬁcial truncal reﬂux. Part II focuses on evidence supporting the prevention
and management of varicose vein patients with compression, on treatment with drugs and nutritional supplements, on
evaluation and treatment of varicose tributaries, on superﬁcial venous aneurysms, and on the management of complications of varicose veins and their treatment. All guidelines were based on systematic reviews, and they were graded
according to the level of evidence and the strength of recommendations, using the GRADE method. All ungraded
Consensus Statements were supported by an extensive literature review and the unanimous agreement of an expert,
multidisciplinary panel. Ungraded Good Practice Statements are recommendations that are supported only by indirect
evidence. The topic, however, is usually noncontroversial and agreed upon by most stakeholders. The Implementation
Remarks contain technical information that supports the implementation of speciﬁc recommendations. This

comprehensive document includes a list of all recommendations (Parts I-II), ungraded consensus statements, implementation remarks, and best practice statements to aid practitioners with appropriate, up-to-date management of
patients with lower extremity varicose veins. (J Vasc Surg Venous Lymphat Disord 2024;12:101670.)
Keywords: Ablation; Compression; Cyanoacrylate; Chronic venous disease; Mechanochemical; Endovascular; Endovenous; Foam; Guidelines; Thrombosis; Thrombophlebitis; Venoactive drugs; Laser; Radiofrequency; Sclerotherapy; Saphenous vein; Varicose veins; Venous insufﬁciency

Summary of recommendations and statements
1. Evaluation of patients with varicose veins
1.1. Classiﬁcation and grading of clinical severity of chronic venous disorders
Good Practice Statements
1.1.1.

We recommend the use of the 2020 updated clinical stage, etiology, anatomy, pathology (CEAP) classiﬁcation system for
chronic venous disorders. The clinical or basic CEAP classiﬁcation can be used for clinical practice, and the full CEAP
classiﬁcation system should be used for clinical research.

1.1.2.

We recommend the use of the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) for patients with chronic venous disorders for
grading of clinical severity and for assessment of post treatment outcome.

1.2-1.5. Doppler ultrasound scanning (DUS)
Guideline
1.2.1.

Grade of
Recommendation

For patients with chronic venous disease of the lower extremities, we recommend DUS as 1 (strong)
the diagnostic test of choice to evaluate for venous reﬂux.

Quality of
Evidence
B
(moderate)

Implementation remarks
1.3.1.

Reﬂux is deﬁned as a minimum value >500 ms of reversed ﬂow in the superﬁcial truncal veins (great saphenous vein [GSV],
small saphenous vein [SSV], anterior accessory great saphenous vein [AAGSV], and posterior accessory great saphenous vein
[PAGSV]) and in the tibial, deep femoral, and perforating veins. A minimum value of >1 second of reversed ﬂow is diagnostic
of reﬂux in the common femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins. There is no minimum diameter required to have pathologic
reﬂux.

1.3.2.

Axial reﬂux of the GSV is deﬁned as uninterrupted retrograde venous ﬂow from the groin to the upper calf. Axial reﬂux in the
SSV is deﬁned as being from the knee to the ankle. Axial reﬂux in the AAGSV and PAGSV is retrograde ﬂow between two
measurements, at least ﬁve cm apart. Retrograde ﬂow can occur in the superﬁcial or deep veins, with or without perforating
veins. Junctional reﬂux is limited to the saphenofemoral (SFJ) or saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ). Segmental reﬂux occurs in
only a portion of a superﬁcial or deep truncal vein.

1.3.3.

A deﬁnition of “pathologic” perforating veins in patients with varicose veins (CEAP) clinical class C2 includes those with an
outward ﬂow duration of >500 ms and a diameter of >3.5 mm on DUS.

Good Practice Statements
1.4.1.

We recommend that evaluation of reﬂux with DUS be performed in an Intersocietal Accreditation Commission or American
College of Radiology accredited vascular laboratory by a credentialed ultrasonographer, with the patient standing whenever
possible. A sitting or reverse Trendelenburg position can be used if the patient cannot stand.

1.4.2. We recommend that for evaluation of reﬂux with DUS, the sonographer use either a Valsalva maneuver or augmentation to
assess the common femoral vein and SFJ and distal augmentation with either manual compression or cuff deﬂation for
evaluation of more distal segments. Superﬁcial reﬂux must be traced to its source, including the saphenous junctions, truncal
or perforating veins, or pelvic origin varicose veins. The study should be interpreted by a physician trained in venous DUS
interpretation.
1.4.3.

We recommend that a complete DUS examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities include transverse gray scale
images without and with transducer compression of the common femoral, proximal, mid, and distal femoral and popliteal
veins, SFJ, and at least two segments along the GSV and SSV.

1.4.4. We recommend that a complete DUS examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities include measurement of the
spectral Doppler waveform using calipers. Reﬂux at baseline and in response to a Valsalva maneuver or distal augmentation
in the common femoral vein and at the SFJ and in response to distal augmentation in the midfemoral and popliteal vein
should be documented. Reﬂux in the GSV at the proximal thigh and knee, in the AAGSV or PAGSV at the SFJ and at the
proximal thigh and in the SSV at SPJ and at the proximal calf should be documented.
1.4.5.

We recommend that a complete DUS examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities include diameter
measurements in patients with the leg in the dependent position, from the anterior to the posterior wall, in the GSV 1 cm
distal to the SFJ, at the proximal thigh and at the knee, in the AAGSV and PAGSV in the proximal thigh, and in the SSV at the
SPJ and the proximal calf. Images of both normal and abnormal ﬁndings should be documented in the records of the
patient.

1. Evaluation of patients with varicose veins
Consensus statements
1.5.1.

In asymptomatic patients with telangiectasias or reticular veins (CEAP Class C1) DUS evaluation of the lower extremity veins
should not be routinely performed, since testing could result in unnecessary saphenous vein ablation procedures.

1.5.2.

In symptomatic CEAP Class C1 patients with bleeding or with severe symptoms of pain or burning due to moderate to severe
telangiectasias or reticular veins, DUS evaluation may be performed to exclude associated venous incompetence; however,
saphenous ablation for C1 disease without bleeding is rarely required.

1.5.3.

In symptomatic patients with varicose veins (CEAP Class C2) the deep venous system should be routinely evaluated for
infrainguinal obstruction or valvular incompetence

1.5.4.

In symptomatic patients with varicose veins (CEAP Class C2) evaluation for iliofemoral venous obstruction with DUS or with
other imaging studies should be performed if suprapubic or abdominal wall varicosities are present and in patients with
symptoms of proximal obstruction, including thigh and leg fullness, heaviness, swelling and venous claudication. CEAP
Classes 3-6 warrant DUS or other imaging studies to evaluate for iliofemoral obstruction.

1.5.5.

In patients with medial thigh or vulvar varicosities evaluation of pelvic venous pathology with DUS or other imaging studies is
not indicated if they have no symptoms of pelvic venous disease.

4.1.6.

For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and axial reﬂux in the GSV who place a high 2 (weak)
priority on the long-term outcomes of treatment (quality of life [QOL] and recurrence), we
suggest treatment with endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA),

5. Factors affecting choice of superﬁcial truncal ablation and outcome
Guidelines
5.1.1.

Grade of
recommendation

In symptomatic patients with C2 disease we suggest against using truncal vein diameter 2 (weak)
to determine which patients need venous ablation

Quality of
Evidence
B
(moderate)

Consensus statements
5.2.1.

In asymptomatic patients with C2 disease, prophylactic intervention does not prevent progression of venous disease. Weight
control, compression stockings, and avoiding prolonged standing may be beneﬁcial.

5.2.2.

Interventions to treat varicose veins can be performed in an ofﬁce-based setting, surgery center, or hospital operating room,
at the discretion of the physician, who is specialized in vein care. Better patient experience and lower cost was reported for
procedures performed in an ofﬁce-based setting.

5.2.3.

In patients with symptomatic C2 disease, isolated SFJ incompetence does not justify ablation of an otherwise competent
GSV.

5.2.4.

In patients with symptomatic C2 disease, ablation of the incompetent GSV may be indicated, even if the axial reﬂux is not
complete and the SFJ is competent. Ablation of isolated reﬂuxing GSV segments, in the presence of competent segments
proximally and distally, is rarely indicated. Shared decision-making with the patient is warranted.

5. Factors affecting choice of superﬁcial truncal ablation and outcome
5.2.5.

In patients with reﬂux in the below-knee GSV, ablation to the lowest point of reﬂux resulted in better early outcome.
Nonthermal techniques are better for ablation of reﬂuxing distal calf saphenous veins, to avoid thermal nerve injury.

5.2.6.

In patients with an epifascial or superﬁcial saphenous vein, thermal ablation may result in skin burns, hyperpigmentation, or
induration, while nonthermal techniques may cause hyperpigmentation or induration. Miniphlebectomy or limited stripping
is safe and effective if the saphenous vein is close to the skin (<0.5 cm).

5.2.7.

For patients with large (>10 mm), nonaneurysmal saphenous veins, thermal ablation with EVLA or RFA should be performed
rather than using nonthermal ablation techniques.

5.2.8. The incidence of superﬁcial thrombophlebitis has been reported to be similar for thermal and nonthermal ablations.
5.2.9.

In patients with uncomplicated C2 disease (no venous claudication, thigh swelling, suprapubic or abdominal wall
varicosities) due to concurrent superﬁcial incompetence and iliac or iliofemoral venous obstruction, treatment of superﬁcial
incompetence ﬁrst is indicated.
6. Interventions to preserve the GSV

Guideline

Grade of

For treatment of symptomatic varicose tributaries, we recommend miniphlebectomy or
ultrasound guided sclerotherapy using physician-compounded foam (PCF) or polidocanol
endovenous microfoam (PEM).

7.2.2. For treatment of symptomatic varicose tributaries, we suggest transilluminated powered 2 (weak)
phlebectomy as an alternative treatment for patients with clusters of varicosities by a
physician who is trained in the procedure.

C (low to

Consensus statements
7.2.3.

For patients with symptomatic varicose tributaries, treatment of the tributaries should be performed, even if the superﬁcial
trunks are competent.

7.2.4. There is no clinical evidence that FS using room air is less safe and effective than using CO2 gas mixture.
7.2.5.

There is currently no clinical study of sclerotherapy with PCF, prepared using the Tessari method, that shows that it is less safe

sclerotherapy for persistent or recurrent symptoms. Longer follow-up is recommended for those with recurrence or more
advanced CEAP class.
9. Management of recurrent varicosities

Consensus statements
9.1.1.

For patients with symptomatic recurrent varicosities, clinical evaluation and DUS
should be performed before treatment to determine the potential source of
recurrence.

9.1.2

For patients with symptomatic recurrent varicosities due to persistent or recurrent
reﬂux of the GSV or AAGSV, treatment either with open surgical or endovascular
techniques may be performed, with good outcomes expected.

9.1.3.

For patients with symptomatic recurrent varicosities due to persistent or recurrent
reﬂux at the groin, either EVLA or RFA can be used if there is a straight GSV stump,
long enough for thermal ablation. Sclerotherapy or phlebectomy should be
performed for recurrence due to neovascularization.

9.1.4.

For patients with symptomatic recurrent varicosities due to persistent or recurrent
reﬂux of the SSV, UGFS should be performed.

9.1.5.

For patients with residual or recurrent varicosities due to incompetent perforator
veins, treatment with both open and endovascular techniques may be used
depending on the physician’s experience, patient choice and availability of
technology.

Antithrombotic Therapy for VTE Disease: Second Update of the CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report. Chest. 2021;
160(6):e545-e608. The evidence base for these guidelines was adopted without review.

Consensus statements
11.4.1.

For patients with asymptomatic ARTE III and IV after endovenous ablation, anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant
(over a vitamin K antagonist) should be performed.

11.4.2.

For patients who receive anticoagulation for ARTE following endovenous ablation, treatment should be continued until the
thrombus retracts.
12. Management of superﬁcial vein thrombosis (SVT)

Guideline 12. addresses the management of SVT in patients who have not recently undergone superﬁcial venous interventions. The
management of ARTE and other thrombotic complications of superﬁcial venous interventions are addressed in Guideline 11.
Guidelines
12.1.1.

Grade of
recommendation

For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks and tributaries above the knee >3 cm 1 (strong)
from the SFJ and >5 cm in length, whether associated with varicose veins or not, we
recommend fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneously daily for 45 days. Alternatively,
rivaroxaban 10 mg/d for 45 days may be appropriate for patients unwilling or unable to
perform subcutaneous injections.

Quality of
Evidence
A (high)

Consensus statement
12.1.2.

For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks #3 cm from the SFJ, treatment with full anticoagulation for a minimum
of 6 weeks should be continued.

Guidelines
12.1.3.

Grade of
recommendation

For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks we recommend against using
1 (strong)
prophylactic or therapeutic dose low-molecular weight heparin and nonsteroid antiinﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Although both have been found to reduce SVT pain and
extension, they have failed to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE). If NSAIDs are used
for treatment of short segment distal SVT, surveillance with DUS for VTE extension is
recommended due to the high prevalence of concomitant DVT.

Consensus statement
12.1.5.

In patients with saphenous thrombophlebitis, ablation should be performed once the inﬂammation has resolved if there is
evidence of pathologic reﬂux on DUS.
13. Management of bleeding varicose veins

Consensus statements
13.1.

For patients presenting with acute bleeding from varicose veins, leg elevation,
direct compression, and sclerotherapy should be attempted before suture ligation
to control bleeding.

13.2.

For patients with bleeding due to varicose veins, prompt referral to a venous
specialist should be done.

13.3.

For patients who presented with bleeding from varicose veins, after the bleeding
has been controlled, evaluation for superﬁcial venous incompetence and
appropriate intervention on the responsible veins should be done to control venous
hypertension and reduce the risk of recurrent hemorrhage.

13.4.

Patients with varicose veins or venous ulcerations should be counseled on the
possibility of venous bleeding and their families, caregivers, or friends educated
regarding leg elevation and simple compression techniques to control severe
bleeding.
14. Management of superﬁcial vein aneurysms

Consensus statements
14.1.

For patients with superﬁcial truncal vein aneurysm, located within 3 cm of the SFJ
or SPJ, open surgical excision, with high proximal and distal ligations should be
performed. If symptomatic saphenous reﬂux is present, endovenous or open
surgical ablation (phlebectomy or limited stripping) of the distal saphenous vein
should be performed.

14.2.

For patients with an asymptomatic superﬁcial truncal vein aneurysm, located
>3 cm distal to the SFJ, endovenous ablation alone should be performed.
Thromboprophylaxis in these patients reduces the risk of VTE.

14.3.

Patients with symptomatic, thrombosed or large (>3 cm) aneurysms in the
superﬁcial veins are best treated with surgical excision.

DISCLAIMER
The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) develops evidenced-based clinical practice guidelines as a resource
to assist members in the practice of vascular surgery.
The guideline recommendations contained herein are
based on a recent review of published evidence. They
reﬂect the available body of evidence, and their applicability reﬂects the limitations of that data and are subject
to reassessment and revision as new knowledge
emerges. Given these limitations, clinical practice guidelines do not represent a statement of the standard of
care, nor do they substitute for clinician judgment or
supplant patient preference or shared decision-making.
The Society of Vascular Surgery recognizes that departure from guidelines may be warranted when, in the
reasonable judgment of the treating clinician, such
course of action is indicated by the clinical presentation
of the patient, limitations of available resources, advances in knowledge or technology, or patient preference. The reader must rely solely on their own
judgment to determine what practices and procedures,

whether included in this practice guideline or not, are
appropriate for them, their patient, their institution, or
their practice.

INTRODUCTION
Varicose veins of the lower extremities are among the
most frequent medical conditions affecting millions of
people worldwide.1-3 Chronic venous disease (CVD) may
cause minimal symptoms, but varicose veins may often
also be the source of discomfort, pain, swelling, thrombosis, bleeding, and ulcerations, causing disability and a
negative impact on physical, psychological, and social
functioning components of quality of life (QOL).4 Patients
with chronic venous insufﬁciency (CVI) may progress to
phlebolymphedema, skin changes with chronic inﬂammation, and venous leg ulcerations.5,6
The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), the American
Venous Forum (AVF), and the American Vein and
Lymphatic Society have collaborated to update the 2011
SVS/AVF guidelines on CVD,7 and recently published Part
I of the 2022 clinical practice guidelines for the

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders

management of varicose veins of the lower extremities.8 All
recommendations in Part I were based on a new, independent systematic review and meta-analysis9 that provided
the latest scientiﬁc evidence to support updated or
completely new guidelines on evaluation with duplex
scanning and on the management of superﬁcial truncal
reﬂux in patients with varicose veins. The writing committee recognized, however, that several additional important
clinical issues need to be addressed, but many have varying
levels of scientiﬁc evidence.10-41 When a systematic review
was not available, the writing committee based ungraded
statements on a comprehensive review of the literature,
combined with unanimous consensus of the expert panel.
Part II of the guidelines focuses on the rationale and scientiﬁc evidence for prevention and management of varicose
veins with compression, medications, and nutritional supplements, as well as on evaluation and treatment of varicose
tributaries, factors affecting treatment outcomes, the management of superﬁcial vein thrombosis (SVT), thrombotic
complications of varicose vein treatments, thrombus extension following ablation, management of bleeding varicose
veins and the treatment of superﬁcial vein aneurysms. This
comprehensive document provides a list of all recommendations (Parts I-II), as well as consensus and best practice
statements to aid practitioners with up-to-date, appropriate management of patients with symptomatic lower
extremity varicose veins (Clinical stage, Etiology, Anatomy,
Pathology [CEAP] Class C2 disease). Updates of other, previously published society guidelines5,7,42,43 will address the
management of venous ulcers, associated with varicose
veins (C5-C6 disease), evaluation and treatment of deep
vein obstructions and chronic pelvic venous disorders.

METHODS
A multisociety and multispecialty writing group that
included 20 members authored both Part I and Part II of
these varicose vein guidelines. The methods of writing
Part I of the guidelines was described previously.8 For Part
II, the writing committee conducted a survey and held
several meetings to compose a list of important clinical
topics, not addressed in Part I, that are intended to guide
comprehensive, up-to-date prevention and management
of varicose veins and associated complications. A ﬁnal list
of 80 questions were divided into ﬁve sections, with each
assigned to a writing group. The members of the groups
performed an extensive search, up to January 31, 2023, of
the English-language literature on their relevant topic, using
the Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of
Science, Cochrane Library, and Ovid Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews databases. Systematic reviews, metaanalyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and prospective and retrospective observational studies that included
>10 patients with varicose veins were used. Drafts of the
writing groups were discussed on Zoom meetings, and all
recommendations and statements were unanimously
approved by the writing committee. All clinical practice

guidelines in Part II were based on evidence established
with one or several systematic reviews, with or without
meta-analysis, using the GRADE method,44-46 as described
in detail in Part I of the guidelines.8 We used the standard
nomenclature of “we recommend” and “we suggest” to
describe strong and weak recommendations, respectively.
To make these guidelines comprehensive and practical
for clinicians, we developed three other types of
ungraded statements, in addition to formal graded recommendations. Good Practice Statements are recommendations that are supported by indirect evidence
that cannot be easily synthesized, yet the topic is usually
noncontroversial and agreed upon by most stakeholders.8 Implementation Remarks contain technical information that supports the implementation of speciﬁc
recommendations.47 Ungraded Consensus Statements
refer to evaluation or treatment as a unanimous
consensus of the expert panel, based on their own
comprehensive review of the literature, even though
some of the topics had minimal or low-quality evidence.

RECOMMENDATIONS AND STATEMENTS
1. Evaluation of patients with varicose veins
1.1. Classiﬁcation and grading of clinical severity of
chronic venous disorders.
1.1.1. We recommend the use of the 2020 updated
CEAP classiﬁcation system for chronic venous disorders. The clinical or basic CEAP classiﬁcation can be
used for clinical practice, and the full CEAP classiﬁcation system should be used for clinical research.
Good Practice Statement
Rationale and evidence. The CEAP classiﬁcation was
designed at a consensus meeting of international experts
in 1994,48 it was updated in 2004,49 and most recently in
2020.50 The classiﬁcation is based on clinical signs, etiology, anatomy and pathology (reﬂux and obstruction) of
chronic venous disorders. The basic or clinical CEAP classiﬁcation reports the single highest C class, and the
advanced CEAP reports all C classes present in the limb.
Patients with reticular veins (subdermal veins between 1
and <3 mm in diameter) and telangiectasias (subdermal
spider veins, <1 mm in size) belong to Class C1. Varicose
veins are dilated subcutaneous tributaries $3 mm in
diameter and patients with varicose veins belong to CEAP
Class C2. CVD is deﬁned as CEAP Class C2 to C6, CVI includes limbs with CEAP Class 3 to 6.49-52 The term CVI is
reserved for advanced CVD with functional abnormalities
of the venous system producing edema, skin changes, or
venous leg ulcers.51 Each clinical class has a subscript
indicating the presence or absence of symptoms (s or a).
Symptoms of varicose veins may include pain, burning,
cramping, feeling of limb heaviness or swelling, restless leg
or itching. The most important of these have been identiﬁed as HASTI symptoms and include heaviness in the
legs, achiness, swelling, throbbing, and itching.53,54 CEAP is

10

Gloviczki et al

January 2024

a descriptive instrument designed to categorize the
affected limb and not a quantitative severity scale, scoring
system, or an outcome measure that reﬂects changes over
time. For a table of the updated CEAP classiﬁcation please
see Part I of the Guidelines.8
1.1.2. We recommend the use of the revised Venous
Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) for patients with chronic
venous disorders for grading of clinical severity and for
assessment of post treatment outcome.
Good Practice Statement
Rationale and evidence. The revised VCSS is a physicianderived evaluative instrument that is useful to describe the
severity of chronic venous disorders. VCSS is responsive to
changes over time and is suitable to document response to
treatment. VCSS, together with the CEAP classiﬁcation, has
been widely adopted in North American5,7 and international55-59 venous guidelines. The instrument comprises
nine categories, each graded on a scale of 0 to 3. The categories include pain, varicose veins, edema, pigmentation,
inﬂammation, induration, presence and size of ulcers, and
use of compression therapy (Table I). VCSS has been validated and there is correlation between VCSS, CEAP, the
modiﬁed Chronic Venous Insufﬁciency Questionnaire
(CIVIQ) patient-reported outcome instrument and venous
duplex ﬁndings.60,61 The strongest correlation occurred in
pain (r ¼ 0.55; P < .0001). A good correlation was also found
in the ability of VCSS and the Villalta-Prandoni scale to
detect mild to moderate post-thrombotic CVD (gamma
statistic ¼ 0.71-0.98; P < .05).62
1.2-1.5. Evaluation with duplex ultrasound scanning.
1.2.1. For patients with CVD of the lower extremities, we
recommend duplex ultrasound scanning (DUS) as the
diagnostic test of choice to evaluate for venous reﬂux.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
For Rationale and Evidence, please see Part I of the varicose vein guidelines.8
Implementation remarks.
1.3.1. Reﬂux is deﬁned as a minimum value of >500 ms
of reversed ﬂow in the superﬁcial truncal veins (great
saphenous vein [GSV], small saphenous vein [SSV],
anterior accessory GSV [AAGSV], posterior accessory
GSV [PAGSV]) and in the tibial, deep femoral, and perforating veins. A minimum value of >1 second of reversed
ﬂow is diagnostic of reﬂux in the common femoral,
femoral, and popliteal veins. There is no minimum diameter required to have pathologic reﬂux.
1.3.2. Axial reﬂux of the GSV is deﬁned as uninterrupted retrograde venous ﬂow from the groin to the
upper calf. Axial reﬂux in the SSV is deﬁned as being
from the knee to the ankle. Axial reﬂux in the AAGSV
and PAGSV is retrograde ﬂow between two measurements, $5 cm apart. Retrograde ﬂow can occur in
the superﬁcial or deep veins, with or without perforating veins. Junctional reﬂux is limited to the

saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) or saphenopopliteal
junction (SPJ). Segmental reﬂux occurs in only a
portion of a superﬁcial or deep truncal vein.
1.3.3. A deﬁnition of “pathologic” perforating veins in
patients with varicose veins (CEAP clinical class C2 includes those with an outward ﬂow duration of
>500 ms and a diameter of >3.5 mm on DUS.
For Rationale and Evidence supporting the Implementation Remarks 1.3.1 to 1.1.3, please see Part I of the varicose vein guidelines.8
Good Practice Statements.
1.4.1. We recommend that evaluation of reﬂux with
DUS be performed in an Intersocietal Accreditation
Commission or American College of Radiology
accredited vascular laboratory by a credentialed ultrasonographer, with the patient standing whenever
possible. A sitting or reverse Trendelenburg position
can be used if the patient cannot stand.
1.4.2. We recommend that, for evaluation of reﬂux
with DUS, the sonographer use either a Valsalva maneuver or distal augmentation to assess the common
femoral vein and SFJ, and distal augmentation should
be used with either manual compression or cuff deﬂation for evaluation of more distal segments. Superﬁcial
reﬂux must be traced to its source, including the saphenous junction, truncal or perforating veins, or pelvic
origin varicose veins. The study should be interpreted
by a physician trained in venous DUS interpretation.
1.4.3. We recommend that a complete DUS examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities includes
transverse grayscale images without and with transducer compression of the common femoral vein, proximal, mid, and distal femoral veins, popliteal veins, the
SFJ, and at least two segments along the GSV and SSV.
1.4.4. We recommend that a complete DUS examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities includes
measurement of the spectral Doppler waveform using
calipers. Reﬂux at baseline and in response to Valsalva
or distal augmentation in the common femoral vein
and at the SFJ should be documented. Reﬂux in
response to distal augmentation in the midfemoral
and popliteal veins, GSV at the proximal thigh and
knee, and in the AAGSV and SSV at the SPJ or proximal
calf should also be documented.
1.4.5. We recommend that a complete DUS examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities includes
diameter measurements with the patient’s leg in the
dependent position, from the anterior to posterior
wall, at the SFJ, in the GSV 1 cm distal to the SFJ, at
the proximal thigh and knee, in the AAGSV, and in
the SSV at the SPJ or proximal calf. Images of both
normal and abnormal ﬁndings should be documented
in the patient’s records.

Statements 1.4.1 to 1.4.5, please see Part I of the varicose
vein guidelines.8

American Venous Forum Ad Hoc Outcomes Working Group. J Vasc Surg. 2010 Nov; 52(5):1387-96. AVF Document, with permission.

Consensus statements.
1.5.1. In asymptomatic patients with telangiectasias
or reticular veins (CEAP Class C1), DUS evaluation of
the lower extremity veins should not be performed
routinely because testing could result in unnecessary
saphenous vein ablation procedures.

Rationale. Asymptomatic CEAP Class C1 venous disorder
is usually a cosmetic problem; asymptomatic telangiectasias or reticular veins should not be treated for the purpose
of preventing progression to more advanced venous disease.
Saphenous vein ablation is not indicated in these patients for
medical reasons. The GSV may need to be used in the future

12

Gloviczki et al

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders
January 2024

as a conduit for bypass in coronary or leg arteries; therefore, it
should be preserved whenever possible. Thus, DUS evaluation of the venous system should not be performed.
Evidence. There is no scientiﬁc evidence that complications of venous disorders can be prevented by treatment
of asymptomatic telangiectasias or reticular veins. Because
the GSV can be used as a conduit for bypass in coronary or
leg arteries, it should be preserved whenever possible. The
SVS published the “Choosing Wisely” initiative, which suggests that routine venous ultrasound testing in asymptomatic C1 patients should not be performed and that it could
result in unnecessary saphenous vein ablation procedures.63 Ruckley et al64 found a signiﬁcant but weak association between advanced telangiectasias, located at the
medial thigh and GSV incompetence.
1.5.2. In symptomatic CEAP Class C1 patients with
bleeding or with severe symptoms of pain or burning
due to moderate to severe telangiectasias or reticular
veins, DUS evaluation may be performed to exclude associated venous incompetence; however, saphenous ablation for C1 disease without bleeding is rarely required.
Rationale. DUS examination is only indicated in patients with complicated C1 disorder. The most severe
complication is bleeding, but in rare cases, pain and
burning due to telangiectasias or reticular veins are also
indications for DUS to evaluate and treat associated superﬁcial venous incompetence. Patients with mild symptoms and certainly those with cosmetic telangiectasias
with intermittent itching or other mild symptoms do
not need Duplex evaluation that could ultimately lead
to unnecessary ablation of superﬁcial truncal veins.
Evidence. Studies by Ruckly et al64 suggest that there are
some patients with symptomatic advanced C1 disorder,
with telangiectasias and reticular veins located medially
along the GSV, who are candidates for saphenous ablation.
Evaluation with DUS is recommended by several groups
before sclerotherapy in patients with symptomatic telangiectasias and reticular veins.56,65,66 Engelhorn et al67
examined 269 limbs of women with telangiectasias
(CEAP C1 class). GSV reﬂux was detected in 44%, but it was
segmental in 73% and only 4% had SFJ reﬂux. The authors
propose further research on the management of the GSV in
these patients. Interestingly, in this study 78% of the limbs
with C1 disease were symptomatic. Somjen et al65 recommended that incompetent reticular veins, present in 80%
to 90% of these cases, should also be treated together with
sclerotherapy of the telangiectasias. However, these larger
reticular veins (1-3 mm) are always located above the superﬁcial fascia, so they can be well-seen with magniﬁcation,
or easily detected during the ultrasound guided liquid or
FS. This study, therefore, does not support routine preprocedure DUS for patients with C1 disorder.
1.5.3. In symptomatic patients with varicose veins
(CEAP Class C2), the deep venous system should be
routinely evaluated for infrainguinal obstruction or
valvular incompetence.

Rationale. Deep venous pathology, including reﬂux and
obstruction, may affect outcomes and complications
following interventions for superﬁcial venous incompetence. Evaluation of the deep system in C2 patients with
symptomatic CVD, therefore, is recommended.8,68
Evidence. Among 4881 patients who underwent endovenous ablation for superﬁcial truncal vein in the Vascular
Quality Initiative database, 2254 patients (46.2%) had
combined deep and superﬁcial reﬂux (Table II). After a
median follow-up of 336 days, symptoms improved in
both groups and improvement in VCSS score was greater
in patients with deep vein reﬂux. These patients, however,
had substantially higher rates of complications (10.4% vs
3.0%; P < .001), including paresthesia (2.5% vs 0.7%; P <
.001), skin pigmentation (1.2% vs 0.4%; P ¼ .023), superﬁcial
phlebitis (2.0% vs 0.9%; P ¼ .018), wound infection (0.8% vs
0.2%; P ¼ .040), and proximal thrombus extension (3.1% vs
1.1%; P < .001). After controlling for confounding factors,
the estimate of effect size for any complication had an
odd ratio (OR) of 5.72 (P < .001).74 Gianesini et al75 retrospectively analyzed long-term results of the CHIVA procedure in 381 patients and found an increased risk of GSV
reﬂux recurrence among those patients who initially had
reﬂuxing common femoral veins.75 Other investigators
found that ablation of superﬁcial reﬂux may restore
segmental competence of the deep veins76 and that
clinical outcome is excellent after superﬁcial ablation,
despite the presence of deep venous reﬂux.60,71 In one
study, those with persistent symptoms after superﬁcial
vein ablation had femoral or popliteal vein reﬂux velocities
of >10 cm/second.60
Data on infrainguinal deep vein obstruction and interventions on superﬁcial veins are sparse because many
vascular specialists avoid superﬁcial truncal ablation in
patients with extensive post-thrombotic deep vein
obstruction. There is a very low level of evidence that
saphenous ablation can be performed in patients with
femoropopliteal venous occlusion.77 It is important to
remember that, in severely symptomatic patients with
infrainguinal obstruction, the GSV may be used for
deep vein reconstruction.78 Occasionally, reconstruction
of the femoral vein is needed after superﬁcial truncal
ablation in patients, who have congenital absence or severe hypoplasia of the deep veins.79
In a systematic review of superﬁcial venous reﬂux in patients with deep venous obstruction, Benfor and Peden25
suggested that superﬁcial ablation can be performed in
patients with deep vein occlusions, but noted that the evidence to support this recommendation was weak. Most
patients in this review had suprainguinal/iliofemoral
obstruction and most had advanced CVD. In a series of
29 patients with a history of previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) Puggioni et al80 did not ﬁnd an increased
incidence of thrombotic complications after RFA.
1.5.4. In symptomatic patients with varicose veins
(CEAP Class C2), evaluation for iliofemoral venous

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders

Gloviczki et al

13

Volume 12, Number 1

obstruction with DUS or with other imaging studies
should be performed if suprapubic or abdominal wall
varicosities are present and in patients with symptoms
of proximal obstruction, including thigh and leg fullness, heaviness, swelling and venous claudication.
CEAP Classes 3 through 6 warrant DUS or other imaging studies to evaluate for iliofemoral obstruction.
Rationale. Varicose veins can be associated with primary or secondary iliofemoral venous obstruction.
Although many C2 patients with simple varicose veins
need no evaluation for proximal venous obstruction,
those who have more advanced symptoms or signs
(C3-C6) due to iliofemoral disease need further investigation and appropriate treatment.
Evidence. In a recent systematic review of 944 limbs
with previous DVT or current deep vein obstruction,
most patients had iliofemoral venous disease and
advanced CEAP class (C4-C6).25 These patients had better results when vein ablation was combined with
treatment of iliac vein obstruction. It should be noted,
however, that few C2 patients were included in the review leaving this issue unexplored and unresolved. In the
case of iliofemoral venous obstruction, interventions on
the superﬁcial venous system should not impair venous
return from the limb. For this reason, in patients with
symptoms of proximal outﬂow obstruction, like venous
claudication, thigh swelling and pain, or in those with
suprapubic or abdominal wall varicosities, or with
continuous ﬂow and lack of respiratory variations in the
common femoral vein on DUS, investigation of the iliac
veins is warranted. During ablation of the incompetent
superﬁcial veins, collaterals to the suprapubic and
abdominal wall veins should be preserved.
1.5.5. In patients with medial thigh or vulvar varicosities, evaluation of pelvic venous pathology with DUS
or other imaging studies is not indicated if they have
no symptoms of pelvic venous disease.
Rationale. There is an association between pelvic
venous insufﬁciency and medial thigh and vulvar varicosities, and lower extremity varicosities are often more severe in patients with associated pelvic varicose veins.81
Although ovarian vein embolization in patients with
pelvic venous disorders may be helpful for lower extremity varicosities, embolization in patients with varicose vein without chronic pelvic pain has not been
studied. In contrast, direct treatment of pelvic origin
lower extremity, vulvar, or perineal varicose veins without
ovarian vein embolization can be effective and durable.82
Evidence. Nonsaphenous, pelvic origin varicose veins
occur in women in the medial and posterior thigh, vulva,
and inguinal area.83 They are the result of reﬂux from the
internal iliac vein through the inguinal, obturator, perineal and gluteal escape points.42 Vulvar varicosities are
estimated to occur in 22% to 34% of women with varicose veins of the pelvis and in 18% to 22% of pregnant
women.82

Seventy-two symptomatic patients with pelvic source
varicose veins, however, only 7% had chronic pelvic
pain.84 In a systematic review of 13 studies on ovarian
vein embolization in 866 women, technical success was
99.8%; signiﬁcant improvement of pelvic pain was reported in nine studies.85 In one study, lower extremity
varicosities recurred only in 13% at 5 years after embolization.85 Hartung et al86 reported 51% improvement in
lower extremity varicosity following ovarian vein embolization in 119 women, who had both pelvic symptoms and
lower extremity varicose veins. In another study of 43 patients, Castenmiller et al87 showed improvement after
ovarian vein embolization in the lower extremity varicose
veins in 14%, but the success rate was 88% for treatment
of vulvar varicose veins.
Gavrilov reported good clinical results with direct treatment of vulvar varicosities with FS and phlebectomy.82 In
32 patients with asymptomatic pelvic varicose veins,
phlebectomy alone for vulvar varices resulted in no recurrence at 3 to 8 years after the procedure. Sclerotherapy
was effective at 1 year in 10 of 12 patients.82 Current
consensus of experts supports the strategy of direct
treatment of pelvic origin varicose veins in patients with
asymptomatic pelvic reﬂux using liquid or FS, phlebectomy, or pelvic escape points ligation, without the need
for pelvic vein embolization.56,82,83
2. Compression therapy
2.1. Compression therapy vs intervention.
2.1.1. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the superﬁcial truncal veins, we suggest compression therapy for primary treatment if the
patient’s ambulatory status or underlying medical conditions warrant a conservative approach or, if the patient prefers conservative treatment, for either a trial
period or deﬁnitive management.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
Rationale. In patients with varicose veins, compression
therapy has been used for decades to decrease pain and
swelling. Graduated elastic compression stockings
oppose tissue expansion when muscles contract. It can
narrow the superﬁcial veins diameter and therefore
decrease the venous reﬂux and venous hypertension,
key elements in the pathophysiology of CVD.
Evidence. The clinical beneﬁt of compression stockings
for the initial treatment of varicose veins has been studied in a recent Cochrane review of 13 trials, encompassing
>1000 patients88 (Table III). Compression stockings were
compared with no stockings or placebo stockings.88 Four
RCTs showed improvement in symptoms, but they were
subject to bias. Three of the four studies reported side
effects of discomfort, appearance, and application difﬁculty. The beneﬁts of stockings were offset by highly
variable reports of compliance, presumably due to the
most common side effects of itching and irritation.

Graduated compression stockings are classiﬁed according to the pressure applied at the level of the ankle: Class
1, low-pressure stockings exert an ankle pressure
<20 mm Hg; Class 2, moderate compression is between
20 and 30 mm Hg; and Class 3 stocking are high
compression stockings with ankle pressures of
>30 mm Hg.89 When comparing against different levels

of compression and lengths of stockings, there was no
clear difference in this Cochrane review.88 Patient preference for one stocking over another was largely driven
by comfort. None of the studies assessed QOL. Overall,
there was insufﬁcient high quality of evidence to determine whether compression stockings are effective as the
primary treatment for symptomatic varicose veins and if

suggest that compliance with compression stockings
can be as low as 37%.90 For additional evidence, see Part I

2.1.4. In patients with symptomatic varicose veins
who are candidates for endovenous therapy and wish
to proceed with treatment, we suggest against a 3month trial of compression therapy prior intervention.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)
Rationale. There is no rationale for a 3-month trial of
compression therapy before intervention for patients with
CEAP C2 class symptomatic varicose veins who are candidates for endovenous therapy and wish to proceed. Evidence for efﬁcacy of compression therapy in these patients
is less than for efﬁcacy of endovenous ablation (Table IV).
Evidence. Insurance companies and the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services frequently require a 3month trial of compression stockings before intervention
for patients with C2 disease, despite a lack of evidence for
efﬁcacy.90 In a UK-based cost analysis,91 accounting for
clinical recurrences and need for further treatment,
analysis included cost of procedure and subsequent
procedures and quality-adjusted life-years. Across all
measures, compression therapy was found to be inferior
to minimally invasive endovenous therapies (including
ultrasound-guided
FS
[UGFS]
and
endovenous

thermal ablation).91 Although the cost effectiveness was
calculated for the UK, sensitivity analysis suggests that
the conclusions are robust to substantial changes in relative cost, and pertinent to other global healthcare
markets.
As an example, the REACTIV Trial, in which a subgroup
of patients with severe varicosities were randomized to
surgical therapy (HL&S, phlebectomy) compared with
compression therapy.92 Consistently, surgical therapy
produced better results with regards to anatomical disease extent, patient satisfaction, QOL, and cost
effectiveness.92
2.2. Compression therapy after intervention.
2.2.1. In patients undergoing thermal ablation for
saphenous incompetence, with or without concomitant phlebectomy, we suggest postprocedure
compression therapy for a minimum of 1 week for
pain reduction.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Rationale. Compression therapy has been used to
reduce postoperative bleeding, bruising, edema, and
pain after thermal ablation of superﬁcial venous
trunks.93 The type of compression therapy prescribed
following treatment of varicose veins is widely variable
and driven by institutional-, physician-, and insurerlevel preferences. Most commonly, postprocedural
compression therapy is delivered with gradient elastic
compression stockings or elastic bandages. The presence of a pressure gradient, with the strongest
compression at the level of the ankle and lightest at the
top provides the most favorable hemodynamic proﬁle
for reducing limb edema. Stockings are constructed in
various lengths, such as knee high or thigh high, with
variable levels of compression. Compression levels
range from I to III, with I representing the lowest level of
compression and III the highest. Similarly, elastic
stockings vary in compressive properties based on the
length and type of bandage used.
Evidence. The use of compression therapy after ablation of superﬁcial truncal veins is controversial.94 In a

meta-analysis including six RCTs with patients Class C2
or higher, those treated with compression had less pain
within the ﬁrst 10 days postoperatively, and earlier return
to daily activities.13 No differences were noted in bruising
score, VCSS, QOL, complications, or vein occlusion rate. A
subgroup analysis of a meta-analysis, encompassing 1147
patients, suggested that the greatest beneﬁts in pain
reduction were in patients undergoing endovenous laser
ablation (EVLA), with no beneﬁt seen after RFA.26 This
ﬁnding is consistent with other studies demonstrating
greater pain with EVLA compared with RFA.95,96 An RCT
by Bootun et al97 demonstrated a clear beneﬁt of
compression leading to signiﬁcantly better pain scores
for the ﬁrst 5 days after endothermal ablation of saphenous veins. Compression was effective in reducing early
pain also in patients who underwent concurrent phlebectomies (Table V).
The duration of therapy has been studied in the
context of short-term (24-48 hours), mid-term (12 weeks), and long-term (3-6 weeks) therapy. A metaanalysis of 775 patients undergoing endothermal ablation found a difference in postoperative pain at 1 week
but not at later time points in patients undergoing 12 weeks of compression compared with those with
24 to 48 hours.99 Long-term therapy has been shown
to have equivalent outcomes to midterm therapy.98
Therefore, application of compression for 1 week after
any endothermal treatment, especially those with concurrent phlebectomy may be useful for pain reduction.
In the recently published multicenter society guidelines, a compression dressing of >20 mm Hg (corresponding with class II compression stocking pressure)
with eccentric pads over the ablation point is recommended for patients undergoing vein ablation for
greatest reduction in postoperative pain.100

3. Drugs and nutritional supplements
3.1. In symptomatic patients with varicose veins, who
are not candidates for intervention, who are waiting
for intervention or have symptoms after intervention,
we suggest micronized puriﬁed ﬂavonoid fraction
(MPFF) or Ruscus extracts for treatment of vein related
pain, leg heaviness and/or sensation of swelling.*
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
3.2. In symptomatic patients with varicose veins, who
are not candidates for intervention, who are waiting for
intervention or have symptoms after intervention, we
suggest hydroxyethylrutosides or calcium dobesilate or
horse chestnut extract or red vine leaf extract or sulodexide for treatment of vein-related pain, leg heaviness,
night cramps, and/or sensation of swelling.*
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low to very low)

and Drug Administration. The US Food and Drug Administration does not approve medical food or nutritional
supplements (https://www.fda.gov/).
Rationale. Venoactive drugs (VADs), also called phlebotropics or phlebotonics, have shown varying beneﬁts in
patients with chronic venous disorders. VADs have
been largely prescribed in Europe and other parts of
the world,101 but recently they have gained interest in
the United States, where they are available now, mainly
as nutritional supplements.102,103 The most frequently
used VADs include MPFF, diosmin, Ruscus extracts,
hydroxyethylrutosides, calcium dobesilate, horse chestnut extract/escin, and red vine leaf extract. Sulodexide
does not belong to the VAD family, but it has been used
for CVD (Table VI). Pentoxifylline is a vasoactive agent
that has been beneﬁcial in patients with claudication

Evidence. The efﬁcacy and safety of VADs was extensively studied in patients with CVD in double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials and meta-analyses.
There have been two Cochrane reviews, the most recent
in 2020, that included a systematic review and metaanalysis of 7690 patients, enrolled in 56 studies.104,105
The VAD used included rutosides, hidrosmine and diosmin, calcium dobesilate, Centella asiatica, aminaftone,

French maritime pine bark extract, and grape seed
extract. Diosmin is only one component of MPFF, and
MPFF studies were analyzed together with nonmicronized diosmin trials. Most studies included patients
with varicose veins (C2), but also with more advanced
CVI, like venous edema (C3), skin changes (C4-C5), venous
ulcers (C6). Pooled data analysis of VADs was given,
although the document also includes breakdown of the
different effect of individual products as well. The number of patients included in many studies was low and the

was low certainty of evidence that phlebotonics may
reduce pain, measured as a continuous variable,

compared with placebo (SMD, e0.35; 95% CI, e0.54 to
e0.17; 12 studies; 2232 participants). Thirty-seven studies
reported on adverse events; the most frequent were
gastrointestinal symptoms. Findings for speciﬁc groups
of VADs were limited due to small study numbers in
some studies and the heterogeneous results. The authors
downgraded certainty in the evidence from high to
moderate because of risk of bias concerns, and further to
low because of imprecision. It is clear from this review
and multiple other meta-analyses,14-16,112 however, that
some of these drugs or supplements are better than the
others.
The clinical beneﬁts of two compounds, MPFF and Ruscus extracts, have been studied more extensively in
double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs and metaanalyses and they are discussed in more detail here.
For evidence of clinical efﬁcacy of other VADs, including
hydroxyethylrutosides, calcium dobesilate, horse chestnut extract, red vine leaf extract and sulodexide for treatment of CVD, see Appendix I. Most studies with these
products have short (3-6 months) follow-ups; therefore,
long-term efﬁcacy and possible side effects of longterm treatment have not been formally assessed.
Clinical beneﬁt of MPFF.
Rationale. MPFF is composed of 90% diosmin and
10% hesperidin fraction (hesperidin, diosmetin, linarin,
and isorhoifolin). Its beneﬁcial effects in patients with
symptomatic varicose veins are related to the effect
on venous tone, microcirculation, trophic disorders,
edema, inﬂammation, leukocyte adhesion, and activation.101 Pharmaceutic formulations that increase intestinal absorption as micronized form, including the
MPFF represent an innovation and improvement of the
therapeutic efﬁcacy.
Evidence. MPFF has shown several effects beneﬁcial for
patients with varicose veins and CVD. Among them are
an increase of the venous tone, potentiation of the
venous response to norepinephrine,106 and antioxidant
and anti-inﬂammatory properties.107,108 Leukocytes
adhesion molecules inhibition was conﬁrmed in patients
with CEAP Class C2 to C4, in parallel to the improvement
of leg heaviness scores.109 Transient venous reﬂux was
reduced in patients with telangiectasias and reticular
veins treated with MPFF.110
A meta-analysis by Kakkos and Nicolaides14 analyzed
seven RCTs in 1692 patients with CVD (Table VII). Based
on high-quality evidence, the study concluded that
MPFF was highly effective in improving leg symptoms,
edema, and QOL in patients with CVD. The RELIEF study
enrolled 4527 patients with CEAP Class C0 to C4. Approximately 40% of patients belonged to CEAP Class C2. Participants were treated for a period of 6 months and had
signiﬁcant evolving improvement of symptoms, QOL
measured by the CIVIQ instrument and edema assessed
by leg circumference.111 More recently, an RCT compared
two galenic formulations of MPFF, tablets and sachets,

and included 1139 patients with C2s stage representing
44.95% to 49.46%.113 The authors concluded that both
formulations resulted in similar improvement of symptoms and QOL.
A meta-analysis of 10 trials included 1010 patients
treated with MPFF, hydroxyethylrutosides, ruscus extracts, and diosmin. MPFF signiﬁcantly reduced ankle
edema (P < .0001), while the efﬁcacy of the other two
VADS was comparable.112 Another meta-analysis15
compared the efﬁcacy of sulodexide, MPFF, hydroxyethyl
rutosides, calcium dobesilate, ruscus extracts, horse
chestnut extracts, and pentoxifylline. The primary
outcome was ulcer healing, but the drug effects on the
leg volume, ankle circumference, symptoms, as well as
QOL (CIVIQ-20 score) were also assessed. MPFF had superior effectiveness in leg volume reduction, pain, and
improved QOL. Although not within the scope of this
guideline, it is worth mentioning that in a meta-analysis
of ﬁve RCTs, MPFF improved ulcer healing.15,114 The
main MPFF component, diosmin, is effective alone,
although its efﬁcacy is signiﬁcantly less than that of
MPFF.112,115
Five unblinded open-label clinical trials were included
in a systematic review investigating the effects of VADs
on recovery after surgery, endovenous ablation, or sclerotherapy20 (Table VIII). All used MPFF; in one study, sulodexide was also given. Three studies reported
signiﬁcantly less postprocedural pain, one observed no
signiﬁcant effect. Two studies reported signiﬁcant reduction in postprocedural bleeding. Three studies reported
greater symptomatic improvement with MPFF treatment. Based on these results, MPFF may help to reduce
postprocedural pain, hemorrhage, and CVD-speciﬁc
symptoms. These beneﬁts appear to be greater when
treatment is started 2 weeks before the procedure.
When VAD treatment was started only after varicose
veins surgery,117 no beneﬁt was noted.
In a nonrandomized, controlled multicenter prospective study (DEFANCE trial),118 245 C2 patients underwent
HL&S combined with stab avulsion. Patients in one group
(n ¼ 200) received 1000 mg of MPFF daily, the control
group (n ¼ 45) had no drug treatment. Compression
(class 2) was prescribed for 4 weeks after surgery for all
patients. Hematoma (P < .05) and pain (VAS) (P < .05)
were signiﬁcantly lower in the MPFF group. The same results were observed for leg heaviness and fatigue. As discussed, however, compression for 1 week after
endothermal treatment has also been useful for pain
reduction, without MPFF treatment.
Clinical beneﬁt of ruscus extracts.
Rationale. Ruscus extracts increase capillary resistance
and reduce capillary ﬁltration.119
Evidence. A systematic review and meta-analysis120
included 20 RCT vs placebo, ﬁve vs comparative VAD
(hydroxyrutosides and MPFF), and six observational
studies, with a total of 10,246 patients (Table IX).

Varicose veins were listed in the inclusion criteria of
some of the trials (eg, Capelli121), most of them
focusing on CVI with CEAP class from C2 to C5. Data
quality was heterogeneous, but the study concluded
that Ruscus extracts signiﬁcantly improved symptoms
compared with placebo. The best effects were
observed on leg heaviness (P ¼ .001), pain (P ¼ .02),
cramps (P ¼ .025), and paresthesia (P ¼ .031). Venous
capacity, assessed by plethysmography, decreased by
0.7 mL/100 mL compared with placebo (P ¼ .014).
Comparison with hydroxyrutoside and MPFF showed
similar effects on the symptoms. A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis16 included 10 highquality, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs with a
total number of 719 patients (CEAP C2-C5). Compared
with placebo, the RR for pain was 0.35 (P < .00,001),
for heaviness 0.26 (P < .00001), for sensation of
swelling 0.53 (P < .0001), for paresthesia 0.27 (P <
.0001), and for global symptoms 0.54 (P < .00001).
Ankle circumference and leg volume were signiﬁcant
reduced, and the study concluded that Ruscus extracts were effective in reducing symptoms and
edema in patients with CVD.16 In a meta-analysis,112
Ruscus extracts signiﬁcantly reduced ankle circumference vs placebo (P < .001), more so than diosmin.
Another systematic review and meta-analysis15 found
that Ruscus extracts were the most effective in
decreasing foot volume and ankle circumference.

5. Factors affecting choice of superﬁcial truncal ablation
and outcomes
5.1.1. In symptomatic patients with C2 disease, we
suggest against using truncal vein diameter to determine which patients need venous ablation.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)
Rationale. A commonly accepted diameter threshold
for ablation of the GSV or the SSV has been 5 mm. However, data show that ablation of veins <5 mm in diameter
also improves symptoms.122,123
Evidence. Several studies demonstrated a weak correlation between saphenous vein diameter and
increased CEAP clinical class or VCSS; a correlation between QOL and saphenous vein diameter has not been
found.122,124 Most studies segregated veins diameters
into >5 mm or <5 mm. Tan et al124 performed a systematic review of 11 studies and 2732 limbs. Four
studies correlated truncal vein diameter with QOL,
while seven reported only on clinical severity measures.
Four studies found a weak correlation between vein
diameter and VCSS, while one demonstrated correlation with VCSS components.124 The diameters were a
poor predictor of HRQOL, with no relationship to patients’ perceived impact on CVD. The review concluded
that vein diameters should not be used as a single
determinant of who needs venous intervention.124
Perrins et al examined the clinical and anatomical
outcomes of RFA of symptomatic small-diameter
GSVs.122 RFA of symptomatic small diameter GSV
(<5 mm) provided comparable clinical outcomes (vein
closure and improved VCSS at 3 months) and the study
suggested that patients with GSV size <5 mm beneﬁt
from RFA.122 Bendix et al123 reviewed the Vascular
Quality Initiative VV Registry and divided patients into
those with GSV <5 mm (group 1) vs those with GSV
$5 mm (group 2). Both groups had improvement in the
VCSS and HASTI scores. Group 2 had more complications, more adverse VTE events, required more anticoagulation, developed more recanalization and
missed more days of work than group 1. They authors
concluded that patients with a smaller vein size should
not be denied intervention based on size alone.123
5.2.1. In asymptomatic patients with C2 disease, prophylactic intervention does not prevent progression of
venous disease. Weight control, compression stockings, and avoiding prolonged standing may be
beneﬁcial.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Studies have noted progression with worsening CEAP class over time.125-127 This raises the question about the role of prophylactic intervention in
asymptomatic patients with varicose veins, to prevent
progression to symptomatic disease.
Evidence. As discussed before, the CEAP classiﬁcation
is not a severity scale but a classiﬁcation scheme for

patients with chronic venous disorders describing the
clinical, etiologic, anatomical, and pathophysiologic features. Conceptually, however, it has often been pondered
whether patients with varicose veins (C2) can undergo
treatment to prevent progression to CVI later in life. In
the Bonn Vein Study,128 1978 participants were followed
up for a mean of 6.6 years. The prevalence of varicose
veins rose from 22.7% to 25.1% (Table X). Participants with
C2 disease increased to higher C-classes in 19.8% for

nonsaphenous varicose veins and in 31.8% for saphenous
varicose veins. The main risk factor for progression
was obesity. The Edinburgh Vein Study had a 13-year
follow-up; a progression rate of 57.8% (4.3% per year)
was reported, of those with C2 disease at baseline, 31.9%
progressed to CVI.126 Risk factors for progression
included a family history of varicose veins, previous DVT
and obesity. Kostas et al followed 73 mostly asymptomatic contralateral limbs for 5 years in patients who

underwent treatment of symptomatic varicose veins of
one lower extremity. CVD progression was signiﬁcantly
less in patients who were not obese and did not gain
weight during the study.125 Patients who did not use
compression stockings preoperatively and during the
follow-up or had stopped using them also had signiﬁcantly higher incidence of progression compared with
those who used compression.125
A Cochrane study in 2013 looked at nonpharmacological interventions to prevent CVI in standing workers.132
This systemic review concluded that due to the limited
number of trials and study participants, there was insufﬁcient evidence to draw any conclusions as to whether
nonpharmacologic strategies including compression
were effective at preventing the development of CVI in
standing workers. Another systematic review of compression for uncomplicated C2 disease found no consensus
on the class of compression needed for the effective
management of varicose veins and no evidence that
wearing compression slows the progression or recurrence of varicose veins.129 Although evidence presented
in these guidelines show that interventions on varicose
veins are associated with improved QOL and decreased
morbidity, no study examined the role of surgical or
endovascular therapies on C2 patients to prevent longitudinal progression to CVI. The role of treatment in preventing such progression remains undeﬁned.
5.2.2. Interventions to treat varicose veins can be performed in an ofﬁce-based setting, surgery center, or

hospital operating room, at the discretion of the physician, who is specialized in vein care. Better patient
experience and lower cost was reported for procedures performed in an ofﬁce-based setting.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. In the United States, most venous disease
practitioners perform venous procedures, including thermal or nonthermal endovenous ablation, miniphlebectomy and sclerotherapy in an ofﬁce-based setting. A
comparison with the historical method of providing such
interventions in the hospital operating room or in surgical centers helps guide providers.
Evidence. Endovenous procedures are safe and effective with high patient satisfaction when performed in
an ofﬁce-based setting (Table XI). Studies have shown
high technical success for venous interventions in the
ofﬁce-based setting, which is on par with the operating
room setting.135,137,138 Venous procedures in the ofﬁcebased setting have a low overall complication rate,
comparable with most published series that evaluated
similar interventions in the operating room.135,138,133 Jain
et al found that 99% of patients surveyed indicated they
would come back to the ofﬁce for additional procedures.133 Perkowski et al treated 165 patients in an outpatient ofﬁce setting with EVLA of either the GSV, SSV, or
accessory saphenous veins. No DVT or nerve injury were
reported and 97% of patients were mostly or very satisﬁed with their treatment results.134 In a retrospective
study of 429 ofﬁce based stand-alone RFA procedures,

performed under local tumescent anesthesia in 394 patients with varicose veins, Somasundaram et al reported
>75% had resolution of symptoms within 1 year, with 3
endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHITs) and no
major complications. Only 23% needed additional
treatments.135 Cost was signiﬁcantly lower when
compared with RFA procedures performed in a day
surgery setting.135 Combining thermal ablation and other
venous treatments such as phlebectomy and sclerotherapy during the same procedure is also safe and
effective. Jarjous et al treated 72 extremities in 63
consecutive patients with RFA of the truncal and perforator veins, combined with UGFS procedures of tributary

and accessory veins.136 They reported 100% closure of the
treated GSV and SSV and 91.7% closure of tributary veins,
13.9% needed additional treatment and there were no
major or minor complications.136 Lin et al reported on
3073 ofﬁce-based venous procedures: 285 saphenous
vein ablations, 185 miniphlebectomies, and 261 venous
ablations with concomitant miniphlebectomy.137 Overall
technical success was 99.2%, with a complication rate of
1%.137 There are a few studies that looked at patient
satisfaction in an ofﬁce setting compared with an operating room setting. Varetto et al treated 112 patients with
GSV insufﬁciency. Approximately one-half underwent
EVLA in day-surgery and one-half in an outpatient ofﬁce-

based setting. There was no statistical difference in the
postoperative success or complications between the two
groups.138 QOL measures did not signiﬁcantly differ between groups, except for the >65-year-old group, which
demonstrated better QOL in ofﬁce-based setting
compared with the day surgery group.138 Another prospective study sent questionnaires to patients who underwent endovenous ablation with concomitant
phlebectomy in the ofﬁce-based setting and found a
high (98.1%) satisfaction level, with 94.7% of the patients
stating they would undergo the same procedure again in
the same setting, if needed.139 In summary, varicose vein
procedures in the ofﬁce-based setting have a low
complication rate, high patient satisfaction and they are
cost effective.
It is important to note, however, that appropriate treatment of patients with venous disease is dependent not
just on evidence-based guidelines, but that physicians
and qualiﬁed health care professionals have the requisite
education, training and skills to provide such care. In the
context of interventional venous procedures, multispecialty agreement has been reached on the required
training and experience needed for physicians to
perform speciﬁc venous treatments.140 In addition, the
role and degree of involvement by licensed advanced
practice providers, physician assistants and nurse practitioners, has also been deﬁned by the Intersocietal
Accreditation Commission, along with that of nursing
staff and ultrasound technologists. Because these venous
interventions are mostly performed in the private ofﬁce
or ofﬁce-based laboratory setting, the supervising physician has the responsibility to ensure that any procedure,
or parts of procedures, not personally performed by
them is done by an appropriately qualiﬁed and licensed
individual under sufﬁcient level of supervision.
5.2.3. In patients with symptomatic C2 disease, isolated SFJ incompetence does not justify ablation of
an otherwise competent GSV.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. The impact of junctional reﬂux on clinical
manifestations and treatment outcomes is not clear.
Reﬂux patterns and the presence or absence of SFJ
reﬂux have been evaluated in multiple studies and a signiﬁcant percentage of symptomatic patients have been
shown to have lower extremity reﬂux without SFJ insufﬁciency.141-143 Nevertheless, the presence of junctional
reﬂux often determines insurance coverage for ablation.
Assessing the role that junctional reﬂux plays in patients
with symptomatic varicose veins is important to ensure
appropriate care.
Evidence. Studies have indicated that the theory of
descending saphenous valvular incompetence starting
at the SFJ may be inaccurate and therefore there is no
rationale for treatment of SFJ incompetence in the
setting of a normal GSV.141-143 Abu-Own et al141 used
DUS to assess 190 limbs with primary varicose veins.

Sixty-three limbs (33%) had no SFJ incompetence. Labropoulos et al144 looked at 255 limbs in 217 patients with
superﬁcial venous insufﬁciency and normal deep veins
and perforator veins with DUS. Isolated below-knee
reﬂux was associated with more symptoms and signs
than isolated above-knee reﬂux.144 Another study by
Labropoulos et al142 looked at the prevalence of reﬂux in
age-matched asymptomatic young patients and found
that reﬂux can occur in any vein segment and the most
common site was the below knee GSV. Fassiadis et al
studied 611 limbs with primary varicose veins. Of 454
limbs that showed GSV reﬂux on DUS, 240 limbs
exhibited reﬂux of both the GSV and SFJ and 214 limbs
(35%) showed isolated GSV reﬂux with a competent SFJ.
The authors suggested that reﬂux starts distally and
progresses proximally.143 In light of these studies, treatment of isolated SFJ reﬂux appears unnecessary.
5.2.4. In patients with symptomatic C2 disease, ablation of the incompetent GSV may be indicated even
if the axial reﬂux is not complete and the SFJ is competent. Ablation of isolated reﬂuxing GSV segments, in
the presence of competent segments proximally and
distally, is rarely indicated. Shared decision-making
with the patient is warranted.
Consensus statement.
Rationale and evidence. Reﬂux patterns have been
evaluated in multiple studies, and as discussed above, a
signiﬁcant percentage of symptomatic patients have
been shown to have lower extremity axial reﬂux without
SFJ insufﬁciency. Engelhorn et al145 found SFJ incompetence in only 12% of 590 limbs of 326 women with varicose and spider veins (CEAP Class C1-C2). Aurshina
et al146 in their single-center retrospective review of 265
patients including 41 without junctional reﬂux noted that
the location of reﬂux did not affect patient presentation
or outcomes at two years after vein ablation. Others reported more advanced clinical disease in patients with
reﬂux involving the SFJ.147 The common observation in
these studies is that early ablation of the GSV results in
good outcome in symptomatic patients, who have
competent SFJ but incompetent distal thigh or upper
calf GSV.
In contrast, segmental or complete ablation of the GSV
is rarely indicated for isolated reﬂuxing segments with
competent segments proximally and distally (Table XII).
The GSV has an average of 6.7 valves (range, 3-11 valves).149
Isolated segmental reﬂux may be identiﬁed by ultrasound even in the presence of a competent GSV. Such
a phenomenon may occur in a segment between two
competent valves when inﬂow occurs from a competent
tributary and outﬂow from an incompetent tributary or a
competent perforator between the two valves.150 When
symptomatic, such incompetent tributaries can be
managed with phlebectomy.
5.2.5. In patients with reﬂux in the below-knee GSV,
ablation to the lowest point of reﬂux resulted in better

early outcome. Nonthermal techniques are preferred
for ablation of reﬂuxing distal calf saphenous veins to
avoid thermal nerve injury.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Studies have shown that thermal ablation of
the below-knee GSV is feasible and safe.151 In addition,
nonthermal techniques are available if there are concerns about saphenous nerve injury. Elimination of
below-knee GSV reﬂux has been shown to improve
symptoms and reduce the need for additional procedures, compared with ablation of the above-knee GSV
only.152-154
Evidence. Several studies showed better results of
above-knee GSV ablation when there was no residual
below-knee GSV reﬂux.152,153 In a systematic review,
Sussman et al33 found that above-knee-below-knee
EVLA was associated with signiﬁcantly lower odds of
below-knee GSV reﬂux recurrence compared with
above-knee-EVLA only (P < .0001). Theivacumar et al152
randomized 68 limbs of 65 patients with varicosities
and both above-knee and below-knee GSV reﬂux to
either EVLA above-knee, EVLA to below-knee midcalf, or
above-knee EVLA with concomitant below-knee FS.
There was improvement in the Aberdeen Varicose Vein
Severity Score at 6 weeks in all groups, although it was
greater in the latter two groups; patient satisfaction at
twelve weeks was not different between the groups.
Compared with above-knee EVLA, concomitant belowknee ablation (laser or sclerotherapy) resulted in fewer
varicosities and superior symptom relief at 6 weeks
(Table XIII).152 In another study the same authors treated
69 limbs with above-knee EVLA, 40 with C2 disease.153 At
6 weeks, residual varicosities, if present, were treated with
FS. Reﬂux in the below-knee GSV was evaluated, and the
limbs were allocated into three groups: group A, no

reﬂux; group B, ﬂash reﬂux <1 second; and group C, signiﬁcant reﬂux >1 second. Delayed FS was required in 12%
in group A, 14% in group B, and 89% in group C. The
improvement in Aberdeen Varicose Vein Severity Score
at 6 weeks was 86.2% in group A, 82.1% in group B, and
59.1% in group C (P < .001 vs A and B). While EVLA of the
above-knee GSV improved all patients, those with
persistent reﬂux in the below-knee GSV had the least
improvement. In a different study of 50 patients with
complete GSV reﬂux, 16 patients had EVLA in the aboveknee and below-knee GSV in separate sessions, 34 patients had EVLA in the above-knee and below-knee GSV
in the same session.154 Patients with complete GSV reﬂux
complained of ankle pain and swelling. At 11 months, all
patients had resolution of their ankle pain, with 44 patients having resolution of swelling. There were four instances of paresthesias.154 Carradice et al randomized
surgical stripping vs EVLA for treatment of varicose veins.
Twelve of 23 recurrences of varicosities were due to an
incompetent below-knee GSV. GSV ablation in this study
could be safely performed in the distal leg.155 Gifford et al
treated 79 limbs with below-knee-GSV EVLT or RFA for
reﬂux at this site, 43 had Class 1 to 3 disease. Only three
patients (4%) suffered transient paresthesia.
5.2.6. In patients with an epifascial or superﬁcial
saphenous vein, thermal ablation may result in skin
burns, hyperpigmentation, or induration, while
nonthermal techniques may cause hyperpigmentation
or induration. Miniphlebectomy or limited stripping is
safe and effective, if the saphenous vein is close to
the skin (<0.5 cm).
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Thermal techniques pose the potential for
skin burn if the area of ablation is close to the skin. Use
of tumescence anesthesia helps overcome this problem

in most cases. Nonthermal nontumescent techniques
may also be used, although it is not known whether
one technique is superior to others for veins close to
the skin.
Evidence. There is no scientiﬁc evidence that supports
one type of ablation technique over another, based on
depth of vein below the skin. The risk of skin burns appears to be high in limbs with the vein
located <0.5 cm from the skin despite using subdermal
tumescent anesthesia. Pigmentation has also been
observed in these patients. In a systematic review and
network analysis that included 51 studies on EVLA, RFA,
n-butyl cyanoacrylate ablation or FS, Gasior et al156 did
not report on skin burn as a complication. In the 16
studies that Alozai et al29 included in their systematic
review/meta-analysis of treatment modalities of the
AAGSV, there was a 0.7% incidence of paresthesia with
no instances of skin burn. The ablation modalities
included RFA, EVLA, n-butyl cyanoacrylate and sclerotherapy.29 The MARADONA trial, a multicenter randomized study that compared MOCA to RFA, did not ﬁnd a
signiﬁcant difference in the incidence of skin burn or
saphenous neuralgia between the two techniques at
30 days.157
5.2.7. For patients with large (>10 mm), nonaneurysmal saphenous veins, thermal ablation with EVLA
or RFA should be performed over nonthermal
techniques.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. While there are many techniques to perform
venous ablation and they provide favorable outcomes in
the setting of large diameter (>10 mm) veins, thermal ablations have superiority over other treatments.
Evidence. Hamann et al examined the safety and
effectiveness of endovenous thermal ablation in 11

limbs with a large GSV, but < 2 cm in size close to
the junction (Table XIV).158 No DVT or EHIT was noted,
and truncal obliteration was 80% at 1 year. Atasoy
reviewed 44 consecutive patients with large GSVs, with
a mean diameter of 16.95 mm (range, 15-26 mm) and
found a 100% occlusion rate at 1 year after treatment.
All patients had clinical improvement and improved
QOL scores.159 Calcagno et al160 found no difference in
occlusion rates of 246 limbs with saphenous vein
diameter #12 mm diameter (mean, 8 6 2 mm) and of
96 with vein >12 mm (mean, 17 6 4 mm) when treated
with RFA. Fernandez et al treated 183 patients with a
GSV diameter <12 mm and 74 with a GSV diameter
$12 mm. There was signiﬁcant improvement in pain
and QOL in both groups, with no difference in occlusion rates or adverse effects at 1, 6, and 12 months.161
Borsuk and Fokin conducted a prospective study of
261 EVLA procedures of the GSV with a 1470-nm radial
tip laser. Mean diameter of GSV at the SFJ was
24 6 6 mm (range, 21-43 mm).162 88% of veins were
occluded on day 1; of the 31 nonoccluded veins, 21 of
the 31 were occluded by day 7. Ochoa Chaar et al163
reviewed 732 laser ablations, 88 were performed on
veins measuring >10 mm in diameter. Complication
and closure rates were similar for larger and smaller
veins, unsuccessful closure was more likely in the SSV
and anterior accessory saphenous vein (AASV) than in
the GSV.163 In a small case series, Florescu et al164 performed 20 ablations of veins >10 mm and 4 ablations
on veins $20 mm in diameter; successful ablation was
achieved in 100%. In a retrospective study, 129 patients
with a GSV $14 mm underwent either stripping or
RFA.165 A composite endpoint of pain, subcutaneous
hemorrhage, and paresthesia; the technical outcome at

30.8% of the stripping group vs 95.3% in the RFA
group.165 Postoperative pain was associated with
increased BMI and large vein diameter. For large
diameter veins, RFA was superior to stripping. These
data support that thermal ablation techniques are safe
and effective in treating large diameter saphenous
veins. There have been no large case series using
nonthermal techniques in large veins.
5.2.8. The incidence of superﬁcial thrombophlebitis
has been reported to be similar for thermal and
nonthermal ablations.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Different rates of postprocedure thrombophlebitis were reported for different ablation techniques,
but most RCTs and meta-analyses found no signiﬁcant
difference in the rates of thrombophlebitis as a minor
complication after endovenous ablations.166
Evidence. In one of the largest single center retrospective trials of 808 patients, Aurshina et al167 compared
acute thrombotic complications after EVLA with RFA.

The incidence of acute superﬁcial thrombosis in varicose
veins in the ipsilateral leg was 4.6%, and overall thrombotic complications occurred in 10.5%, more frequent
after EVLA than after RFA (11.4% vs 7.7%; P ¼ .007).
Thrombotic complications in this study, however, also
included EHIT. There was no difference in thrombophlebitis following EVLA and RFA in a systematic review
of 12 studies that included 1577 patients (RR, 1.03; 95% CI,
; 95% CI,0.56 to 1.92).166
When comparing nonthermal and thermal techniques,
a systematic review and meta-analysis by Hassanin et al21
found no signiﬁcant difference in phlebitis rates between
groups (pooled RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.32-1.54). Nonthermal
ablations in this study included mechanochemical ablation and cyanoacrylate vein ablations. A meta-analysis
from Chen et al22 found similar results, with no difference
in phlebitis rates between cyanoacrylate ablations vs RFA
(OR, 51.22; 95% CI, 0.70-2.13; P ¼ .479). Single center
studies published on higher rate of mild phlebitis after
cyanoacrylate ablation, likely also due to a periphlebitic

and systematic reviews and meta-analyses showed lower
phlebitis rates after cyanoacrylate treatment of truncal
veins vs thermal ablations.23,24,169 There was a large heterogeneity in these trials and patients represented
encompassed the entire spectrum of CVD (CEAP Class
2-6).
There was no difference in phlebitis rates, when
mechanochemical ablation was compared with EVLA
in the LAMA trial occurring in 7% (5/69) after EVLA
compared with 13% (9/69) after MOCA (P ¼ .262).170 In
a retrospective trial with 979 limbs, Obi et al171 found,
not surprisingly, more asymptomatic phlebitis in patients who underwent RFA plus transilluminated powered phlebectomy as compared with RFA alone.
Combined therapy of endovenous thermal ablation
with polidocanol endovenous microfoam (PEM) sclerotherapy also had higher incidence of phlebitis than
thermal ablation combined with placebo sclerotherapy
(18/79 vs 0/30).172

venous claudication, thigh swelling, or suprapubic or

obstruction, treatment of superﬁcial incompetence
ﬁrst is indicated.
Consensus statement. For Rationale and Evidence,

and 1.5.4.

6. Interventions to preserve the GSV
6.1.1. For patients with early stages of symptomatic
varicose veins we suggest preserving the GSV using
the ambulatory selective variceal ablation under local
anesthesia (ASVAL) technique, if performed by a physician who is familiar with the strategy.

GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence B (moderate)
Rationale and evidence. The ASVAL is a GSV-sparing
method that involves detailed DUS mapping of all varicose tributaries connecting to the GSV and ambulatory
phlebectomy.173,174 The operation is based on the
ascending theory which is that the venous disease process develops in tributaries and distal truncal veins and
“ascends” to the junction and the deep venous system.175
A systematic review of the ASVAL procedure in 2021
included two RCTs, one case-control and three cohort
studies, and ﬁve case series (Table XVI). Varicose vein
recurrence at 1 year ranged from 0.55% to 13.5%, and GSV
incompetence resolved in 50% to 85% at 1 year after the
intervention.31 Another study reported absence of GSV
reﬂux at 1 year in 98% of limbs with competent SFJ at
presentation and in 42% of those with an incompetent
SFJ at presentation.177 Although the level of evidence was
low in the systematic review, ambulatory phlebectomy of
varicose tributaries creating a venous reservoir may have a
positive effect on truncal reﬂux and ASVAL may be an
effective minimally invasive treatment of CVD. Best results were seen in those patients who had a competent
terminal valve at the SFJ.177 The level of evidence for
ASVAL was upgraded to B (moderate) because of the
recently published SAPTAP RCT.176 In this multicenter,
noninferiority RCT single ambulatory phlebectomy (SAP)
was performed in 227 patients and RFA with phlebectomy was done in 237 patients, all with truncal reﬂux and
varicose veins. At 1 year, VEINES-QOL/Sym scores were
noninferior after SAP compared with thermal truncal
ablation and SAP was a cost-effective alternative to
thermal truncal ablation. Twenty-six percent of the SAP
patients underwent additional truncal ablation.176
6.1.2. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins,
we suggest preserving the GSV using the ambulatory
conservative hemodynamic correction of venous

insufﬁciency (CHIVA) technique, if performed by a
physician who is familiar with the strategy.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence B (moderate)
Rationale. The Ambulatory CHIVA was designed to
approach venous hemodynamic insufﬁciency while preserving the GSV, lower transmural pressure in the superﬁcial venous system and avoid removal of varicose
tributaries.178 The goal of CHIVA is to correct the
abnormal hemodynamic pathways that are identiﬁed
with detailed preoperative mapping using DUS. Three
types of “shunts” are identiﬁed during DUS. Truncal veins
are ligated selectively, at the “escape points,” where the
reﬂux starts, and the “reentry points’, the perforators,
where blood enters from the superﬁcial into the deep
system, are preserved. Phlebectomies are not performed
and reduction of the venous pressure reduces the size of
varicose veins a few months after the operation.178
Evidence. Two systematic reviews by BellmuttMontoya et al27,28 studied the CHIVA procedure,
comparing them to HL&S and to endovenous procedures (Table XVII). The last review in 202128 included six
RCTs and 1160 patients, three RCTs compared CHIVA to
HL&S, one to compression treatment of venous ulcers,
one to HL&S and RFA and another to HL&S and EVLA.
Five studies reported recurrence of varicose veins at
18 months to 10 years. The review concluded that CHIVA
may make little or no difference to the recurrence of
varicose veins compared with stripping (RR, 0.74; 95% CI,
0.46-1.20), and it may make little or no difference in
preventing recurrence compared with RFA (RR, 2.02;
95% CI, 0.74-5.53) or to EVLA (RR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.01-4.06).
Side effects were similar, but CHIVA may reduce slightly
nerve injury compared with HL&S and may cause more
bruising than RFA. Evidence supporting all results in this
Cochrane review were of low certainty, based on a small
number of trials with high risk of bias, with imprecise
results due to the small number of events.

A retrospective study by Maeso et al, reported better
clinical results after CHIVA than after HL&S at 3 years.179
In a subsequent prospective study by the same group,
58 patients underwent the CHIVA procedure, with ligation of the GSV tributary that connected to a re-entry
perforator. The ligation eliminated SFJ reﬂux in all but
5 patients (8%). Saphenous reﬂux, however, returned
in 88% of the limbs by 6 months and 46 patients
required a second operation to ligate and divide the
proximal GSV. Elimination of the reﬂux in the GSV after
the interruption of the insufﬁcient collaterals was
temporary.181
A recent RCT by Gonzalez Canas et al180 analyzed results of RFA, HL& S and CHIVA in 214 limbs. Clinical recurrence rates at 24 months were 4.3%, 7.2%, and 14.7% for
HL&S, RFA and CHIVA, respectively. Ultrasound recurrences were 7.1% for HL&S, 13% for RFA, and 46.7% for
CHIVA. With an 80% power to assess noninferiority, the
study found RFA to be noninferior to CHIVA in terms of
clinical recurrence. Considering the steep learning curve
of the drained and nondrained strategies, the different
types of venous-venous shunts, the need for staged procedures175,182-184 and that all patients require an individualized strategy, it is clear that CHIVA should only be
performed by well qualiﬁed surgeons who are dedicated
experts in venous hemodynamics and DUS.185
7. Treatment of venous tributaries
7.1. Telangiectasias (spider veins) and reticular veins.
7.1.1. For patients with symptomatic telangiectasias
and reticular veins we recommend sclerotherapy
with liquid or foam.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence B (moderate)
Rationale. Sclerotherapy has been used for decades for
treatment of telangiectasias or spider veins (subdermal
veins <1 mm in size) and reticular veins (veins <3 mm
in size), with good results. FS has been preferred recently
for larger reticular veins.

Evidence. In a recent Cochrane systematic review and
meta-analysis 3632 patients from 35 RCTs were studied.186 Treatments of telangiectasias and reticular veins
included sclerosing agents, laser and compression. There
was moderate-certainty evidence that sclerotherapy was
better than placebo (SMD, 3.08; 95% CI, 2.68-3.48), but it
resulted in more hyperpigmentation, matting and pain.

Polidocanol had results similar to other sclerosing
agents, but it was less painful. Sodium tetradecyl sulphate sclerotherapy resulted in resolution or improvement of telangiectasias similar to other agents but there
was more hyperpigmentation, matting and probably
more pain. Foam likely caused more matting than liquid
sclerosing agents.

7.1.2 For patients with symptomatic telangiectasias
or reticular veins we suggest transcutaneous laser
treatment if the patient has sclerosant allergy, needle
phobia, sclerotherapy failure or small veins (<1 mm)
with telangiectatic matting.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence B (moderate)
Rationale and evidence. Surface lasers used to treat
telangiectasias have wavelength between 532 nm and
1064 nm.187 The Nd:YAG 1064 nm laser has shown results close to sclerotherapy but more pain was reported
after laser treatment.188 Parlar et al188 recommended
laser for those who have needle phobia, allergy to sclerosants and for small veins with telangiectatic matting,
while sclerotherapy is more effective for larger, feeder
veins. A 2021 Cochrane review186 found no clear difference in resolution or improvement of telangiectasias or
matting when laser was compared with sclerotherapy.
There was maybe less hyperpigmentation (RR, 0.57; 95%
CI, 0.40-0.80) in the laser group. There was more resolution or improvement of telangiectasias in the combined laser and polidocanol group compared with
polidocanol alone (low-certainty evidence). Laser treatment may result in less hyperpigmentation (moderatecertainty evidence). Further well-designed studies are
required to provide evidence for other available treatments and important outcomes (such as recurrence,
time to resolution and delayed adverse events); and to
improve our conﬁdence in the identiﬁed comparisons.
7.2. Varicose tributaries.
7.2.1. For treatment of symptomatic varicose tributaries,
we recommend miniphlebectomy or ultrasound guided
sclerotherapy using physician-compounded foam (PCF)
or polidocanol endovenous microfoam (PEM).
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence B (moderate)
For Rationale and Evidence supporting Guideline 7.2.1.,
please see Part I of the varicose vein guidelines.8
7.2.2. For treatment of symptomatic varicose tributaries, we suggest transilluminated powered phlebectomy as an alternative treatment for patients with
large clusters of varicosities by a physician who is
trained in the procedure.

GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence C (low to very low)
Rationale. In patients with large, clustered patterns of
varicose veins, transilluminated powered phlebectomy
remains an acceptable alternative treatment option
which requires fewer incisions and shorter treatment
times.
Evidence. Several studies have described the safety
and efﬁcacy of ambulatory phlebectomy.171,189,190 Transilluminated powered phlebectomy is a minimally invasive alternative treatment for varicose veins, it is
performed under general or local tumescent anesthesia,
combined with irrigated illumination and endoscopicpowered venous resection.191 Two RCTs concluded that
powered phlebectomy procedures are quicker and
require fewer incisions than traditional phlebectomy, but
a steep learning curve is expected.192,193 Chetter et al193
found, however that compared with ambulatory phlebectomy, ecchymosis (39% vs 25%; P < .001) and pain
were more frequent with powered phlebectomy and
reduced the early postoperative QOL. A meta-analysis of
Luebke and Brunkwall concluded that powered phlebectomy decreased the number of incisions, improved
mean cosmetic score and shortened the duration of the
procedure in patients with extensive varicosities. There
was less calf hematoma after hook phlebectomy and a
worse mean pain score after powered phlebectomy.11
7.2.3. For patients with symptomatic varicose tributaries, treatment of the tributaries should be performed even if the superﬁcial trunks are competent.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. In general, treatment for primary or recurrent varicose veins irrespective of axial competence has
been shown to be effective and indicated for patients
with symptomatic C2 disease.
Evidence. Surgical intervention for symptomatic varicose veins has been widely accepted as being an effective, appropriate therapy with good outcomes for pain
reduction and improvement in QOL. A Cochrane review
in 2004 compared treatments of varicose veins with
surgery vs sclerotherapy and concluded that there
was insufﬁcient evidence to preferentially recommend
the use of sclerotherapy or surgery.194 A systematic

review in 2009 by Leopardi et al195 concluded that
sclerotherapy and phlebectomy may be appropriate in
patients with minor superﬁcial varicose veins not
related to reﬂux of the saphenous system or as a postor adjunctive treatment of varicose tributaries, but data
were limited. A recent Cochrane review in 2021
addressed the efﬁcacy of sclerotherapy alone for
treatment of varicose veins.196 The study included 28
RCTs involving 4278 participants. None of the RCTs
compared sclerotherapy, however, to no intervention or
to pharmacological therapy. There was very low to lowcertainty evidence that FS alone improved cosmetic
appearance, residual varicose veins and symptoms

compared with placebo and possible improved QOL
and VCSS. The study concluded that there is a need for
high-quality trials using standardized sclerosant doses,
with well-deﬁned outcome measures and measurement time points to increase the certainty of the evidence. There have been a number of studies that
showed beneﬁt of treatment of recurrent varicosities
after saphenous ablation using either miniphlebectomy or sclerotherapy, with good results.197,198
Currently, UGFS is most commonly used for treatment
of recurrent varicose veins,198 and re-exploration of the
groin or phlebectomy in that region is avoided. In the
absence of superﬁcial reﬂuxing axial veins or for

patients with prior axial reﬂux ablation, conservative
measures, such as compression or VADs can also be
considered for varicose tributaries (see Guidelines 2
and 3).
7.2.4. There is no clinical evidence that FS using room
air is less safe and effective than using CO2 gas
mixture.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Many studies show the beneﬁt of FS for
treatment of superﬁcial venous disease, with minimal
side effects. While in theory felt to be safer, there is
limited data that directly compares the use of CO2 or
CO2/O2-based foam to room air when treating with
foam sclerosants.
Evidence. UGFS has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of superﬁcial venous disease, and
it is currently recommended for treatment of reticular
and varicose veins, in addition of superﬁcial truncal veins.

In a comprehensive review of the literature Cartee
et al,199 discussed factors affecting foam stability and
found that the half-life of room air foam was reported to
be three times longer than that of CO2 alone and 1.5
times longer than O2/CO2.200,201
Morrison et al202 showed that bubbles were detected in
the right heart in all patients after room air FS and highintensity transient signals were seen in the middle cerebral artery in 4 of 21 patients. Morrison et al203 looked at
side effects using air and CO2 foam for endovenous
chemical ablation and found visual disturbances (VDs)
were experienced by 3.1% (4/128) and 8.2% (4/49) patients
in the CO2 and room air groups respectively (P ¼ .15). Respiratory difﬁculties or circumoral paresthesia each
occurred in 0.8% (n ¼ 1) of the CO2 patients. Incidence
of chest tightness (3.1% vs 18%), dry cough (1.6% vs 16%),
or dizziness (3.1% vs 12%) were signiﬁcantly lower in the
CO2 vs room air group (P < .02). While other

complications were less in the CO2 group, VDs were not
signiﬁcantly different, but conclusion are limited by the
small sample size.
Willenburg et al204 conducted a systemic review evaluating VD following sclerotherapy of varicose veins, reticular
veins and telangiectasias. While the prevalence of VD was
difﬁcult to determine, two RCTs reported no VDs (95 and
75 patients treated, respectively). In large case series
(>500 patients), the prevalence of VD ranged from
0.09% to 2%. In a meta-analysis that included over 9000
patients, Jia et al10 found the median rates of VDs and
headache were 1.4% and 4.2%, respectively. Chest

tightness and coughing occurred in <1%. Room air and
CO2-created foams were included in this metanalysis. Gillet et al205 evaluated the side-effects and complications of
FS in a prospective, multicenter study of room air vs oxygen FS in 1025 patients. The incidence of migraine was
0.78% (with aura 0.59%, 0.19% without aura), VD 0.68%,
chest tightness 0.68%, chest tightness with VD 0.49%
and transient ischemic attack occurred in 0.1%.
In summary, while theoretically CO2 foam supposed
to improve safety proﬁle compared with room air, the
data is limited, and the studies support both methods
of FS (Table XVIII). In addition, room air foam is more

stable than CO2 making both the delivery method and
provider skill important in achieving the desired
outcome.
7.2.5. There is currently no clinical study of sclerotherapy with PCF, prepared using the Tessari method, that
shows that it is less safe or effective than PEM.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. PEM, used for treatment of truncal veins and
varicose tributaries is a promising product that appears
to be more stable and cohesive, with a narrow bubble
size distribution compared with physician compounded
foam, used for sclerotherapy of varicose tributaries and
superﬁcial truncal veins.
Evidence. As articulated in the statement, there is no
clinical evidence that sclerotherapy with PCF, prepared
using the Tessari method is less safe or effective than
PEM. There are no prospective studies comparing the
two techniques since the VANISH-2 RCT compared
0.5% and 1% PEM with placebo (Table XIX).206 In laboratory testing, PEM had a narrow bubble size distribution,

better stability, more cohesive properties and lower
degradation rate than any PCFs.213 Prospective randomized studies comparing PEM with PCF in patients with
varicose veins are warranted.
8. Treatment of varicose tributaries concomitant or
staged with superﬁcial truncal ablation
8.1.1. For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the GSV
or SSV and associated varicosities, we recommend
ablation of the reﬂuxing venous trunk and concomitant phlebectomy or UGFS of the varicosities with
PCF or PEM.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
8.1.2. For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the
AAGSV or PAGSV, we suggest ablation of the reﬂuxing

8.1.4. For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the
AAGSV or PAGSV, we suggest ablation of the reﬂuxing

GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
8.2. For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the major
superﬁcial venous trunks and associated varicosities
undergoing initial ablation alone, we recommend
follow-up for $3 months to assess the need for staged
phlebectomy or ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy for
persistent or recurrent symptoms. Longer follow-up is
recommended for those with recurrence or more
advanced CEAP class.
Good clinical practice statement. For Rationale and
Evidence supporting Guidelines 8.1.1. to 8.1.4. and Good
Clinical Practice statement 6.2, please see Part I of the
varicose vein guidelines.8 The panel strongly recommended concomitant procedures to treat truncal
incompetence and varicose veins at the same settings,
since most patients would like to have a single operation,
but the evidence supporting the efﬁcacy of a concomitant procedure had to be downgraded to C (low to very
low), because the meta-analysis by Aherne et al214
included 12 nonrandomized studies with the intrinsic
associated bias. A subanalysis of three RCTs showed no
difference in reinterventions between the groups. In
addition, 63.9% of the patients with planned staged
intervention never had a second procedure. The study
counted the second operation of a staged procedure “reinterventions” and the percent of reinterventions after
the staged procedures was not investigated. In one of
the RCTs,152 the need for staged treatment of varicose
tributaries was only 17% in those patients who underwent extended EVLA for axial, below-knee saphenous
incompetence.
9. Management of recurrent varicosities
9.1.1. For patients with symptomatic recurrent varicosities, clinical evaluation and DUS should be performed before treatment to determine the potential
source of recurrence.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Mandatory follow-up for C2 patients for
several years post intervention is costly and not indicated.

with DUS to assess the etiology, source, type, and extent
of recurrent varicose veins. The entire ablated vein, sites
of reﬂux at the SFJ or SPJ and at sites of potential incompetent perforating veins should be investigated. DUS can
identify reﬂuxing, recanalized axial veins, and residual
saphenous stumps but it only has a sensitivity of 62%
and a positive predictive value of only 26% to correctly
identify neovascularization.215
Recurrent varicose veins after surgery have been reported to occur between 6.6% to 37.0% at 2 years and
upwards of 50% at 5 years.7 We recommend that all patients who have undergone a venous intervention for
varicose veins have at least one follow-up visit when
symptoms related to the procedure are likely to have
resolved and interval healing has occurred. Any residual
symptoms or problematic residual varicose veins should
be reassessed and documented. Reevaluation after 3
months may be patient initiated based on recurrent
symptoms.

Consensus statement.
Rationale and evidence. Theivacumar et al treated 64
patients with EVLA of the above knee (above-knee)
GSV. Above-knee-GSV EVLA improved symptoms
regardless of persisting below-knee reﬂux; the latter,
however, was responsible for residual symptoms and a
greater need for sclerotherapy for residual varicosities.153
A systematic review in 2021 investigated the incidence
of below-knee residual reﬂux in patients who underwent
ablation of the GSV.33 HL&S in the above-knee GSV (6
studies, 525 limbs), as well as EVLA, above-knee only (7
studies, 696 limbs) and above-kneeþbelow-knee ablation (2 studies, 147 limbs), were included. The authors

associated with signiﬁcantly lower odds of below-knee
reﬂux recurrence compared with above-knee-EVLA
alone (OR, 0.1857; 95% CI, 0.076-0.4734; P < .0001). No
statistically signiﬁcant difference was observed in belowknee-GSV reﬂux recurrence between patients receiving
above-knee-EVLA and those receiving above-knee-HL&S.
Endovenous treatment of below-knee reﬂuxing segments of GSV was investigated in a 2018 retrospective
study of 37 limbs using RFA and EVLA.216 Complete closures were found in 35/37 limbs and VCSS was reduced
in both groups. Ecchymosis scores were signiﬁcantly
lower after RFA vs EVLA with a 980 nm system, but no
difference was reported when compared with a group
where a 1470 nm ﬁber was used. Gifford et al also

reported good outcomes with few complications in a
retrospective series of below-knee-GSV ablation mainly
with EVLA (77 limbs) with only about half of the cohort
including patients with C1 to C3 classiﬁcation and
concomitant ambulatory phlebectomies being performed in 75% of cases.151
Catheter-directed FS has also been investigated as a
treatment modality for recurrent GSV reﬂux in a small prospective analysis of 21 patients in Brazil with mostly C2 disease.216 FS was performed as a pull-back procedure
developed by Parsi with either 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate or polidocanol 3%, using ultrasound guided tumescent anesthesia. Closure rate was 100% up to six months
and 86% at one year. There were no complications.

Bradbury et al studied 1252 legs with C2 to C6 disease.218 They were treated with UGFS. There were 868
C2 and C3 patients. The authors found that out of 1031
patients initially treated for GSV reﬂux, only 11.8%
required a second UGFS for recurrent reﬂux. Of the 139
patients with AAGSV reﬂux, 10.1% required a second
UGFS for recurrent reﬂux. Of the 239 patients with SSV
reﬂux, 10.5% required retreatment for axial vein reﬂux.
New reﬂux rates found in follow-up included 3.4% GSV,
6.5% AASV, and 3.4% SSV.
Hernando et al217 treated 21 patients 16 with C2 disease,
for recurrent symptomatic varicose veins. Previous interventions included CHIVA, mechanochemical ablation,
thermal ablation, and cyanoacrylate closure. The patients
were treated with catheter directed foam for the reﬂuxing axial veins, and phlebectomy for the varicose tributaries. Catheter-directed sclerotherapy was performed
in 18 GSVs. Closure at 1 week and at 6 months was
100%, and at1 year it was 86%.
Turtulici et al222 studied 37 patients with recurrent varicose veins. Ten patients had reﬂux in the SFJ, 21 had single or multiple recanalized and reﬂuxing perforator veins,
and 6 had a combination of SFJ reﬂux and perforator
vein reﬂux. All patients were treated with RFA. Recanalized axial veins were found in 4%, but no retreatment
was required. The vein diameters were small and the
Aberdeen Varicose Vein Severity scores of the limbs
decreased.
9.1.3. For patients with symptomatic recurrent varicosities due to persistent or recurrent reﬂux at the
groin, either EVLA or RFA can be used if there is a
straight GSV stump, long enough for thermal ablation.

Sclerotherapy or phlebectomy should be performed
for recurrence due to neovascularization.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Groin recurrence can be due to recanalized
or enlarged remnants of the GSV or tributaries due to
neovascularization or disease progression from other
vein segments.
Evidence. The Edinburgh group220 has classiﬁed
recurrence into the following subtypes: residual GSV
(type 1A), residual tributaries that have enlarged (1B), or
neovascularization (1C). The disease from new segments, type 2 is subdivided into cross-groin connections
(2A) and thigh perforators (2B). Recurrent veins are
often difﬁcult to classify221 and difﬁcult to treat and
there is no preferred mode of treatment. Options
include surgical removal, sclerotherapy, and thermal
ablation. All modalities have their challenges, including
easy tearing and bleeding in the presence of scarring
from previous open procedures. UGFS is used with
increasing frequency instead of open surgery. EVLA can
be performed if there is a straight stump but it can also
be challenging in patients with tortuous or short GSV
stumps.
9.1.4. For patients with symptomatic recurrent varicosity due to persistent or recurrent reﬂux of the SSV,
UGFS should be performed.
Consensus statement.
Rationale and evidence. SSV recurrence is rare but can
occur following incomplete obliteration distal to the SPJ
and in patients with persisting reﬂux in tributaries associated with the saphenous stump. Recurrence can also
occur if there is neovascularization that reconnects the

popliteal vein to the superﬁcial network or if there are
other sources of proximal reﬂux connecting to the SSV,
not treated initially (Table XX). Currently UGFS appears
to be the preferred treatment.221
9.1.5. For patients with residual or recurrent varicosity
due to incompetent perforator veins (IPVs), treatment
with both open and endovascular techniques may be
used depending on the physician’s experience, patient
wishes, and availability of technology.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. There are no high-level data to compare
outcome of different techniques to treat IPVs responsible
for recurrent/persistent varicose veins. One should rely on
experience, patient wishes, and the availability of the
various techniques reviewed above.
Evidence. A 2016 prospective trial with 296 IPV closures on 112 patients compared three methods of IPV
closure (RFA, EVLA, and FS) in mostly C5 and C6 patients.223 Closure success was signiﬁcantly better with
RFA (73%; P ¼ .05) vs FS (57%) but failed to reach signiﬁcance vs EVLA (61%; P ¼ .09). Interestingly, when
patients failed FS and were subsequently treated with
thermal ablation, RFA success improved to 89% (P ¼

.003) and EVLA success improved to 85% (P ¼ .03). The
authors concluded that RFA was found to be the most
reliable means of IPV closure. After failed FS attempts,
IPV closure was enhanced when thermal ablation was
used as a secondary technique. A common factor
leading to increased failure in all groups was morbid
obesity. Although C2 to C6 patients were enrolled in
this study, only three with C2 disease were included
and all three were treated with foam initially, thereby
signiﬁcantly limiting the applicability of the ﬁndings to
C2 disease. More recently, a technique for cyanoacrylate closure of perforating veins has been described in a
retrospective series of 83 patients with C2-6 disease
(27% C2 patients) showing a success rate of 86.5% at
72 days with complications of mainly superﬁcial phlebitis in about 16% of treated veins recorded within
4 weeks.224 For further evidence on efﬁcacy of IPV
ablation, see Guideline 10.

GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
10.1.2. For patients with varicose veins (CEAP
class C2) who have signiﬁcant, symptomatic axial
reﬂux of the AAGSV or PAGSV, we suggest against
treatment
of
incompetent
perforating
veins
concomitant with initial ablation of the superﬁcial
truncal veins.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
For Rationale and Evidence supporting Guidelines 10.1.1
and 10.1.2, please see Part I of the varicose vein
guidelines.8
10.2. For patients with incompetent pathologic perforators associated with symptomatic residual, recurrent, and rarely primary varicosities, without
associated saphenous incompetence, either open or
endovascular techniques can be used to treat the
perforator veins.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Since IPVs are potential sources of recurrence, occlusion of relevant IPVs is indicated in C2 patients who have symptomatic recurrent or residual
varicose veins after previous superﬁcial truncal ablation
and tributary treatment. Perforating veins may also rarely

be source of primary varicose veins in the absence of
saphenous incompetence.
Evidence. Various techniques have been used to treatment of IPV, from the Linton procedure to subfascial
endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS) and to less invasive
techniques of ligation through mini phlebectomy and
endovenous procedures.225 The Linton and the SEPS
procedures today are of historic interest only, but SEPS
was useful to gain insight into the efﬁcacy of occlusion of
IPVs.226 In an RCT by Kianifard et al,227 72 patients with
C2 disease were treated with HL&S 6 phlebectomy, 38
also underwent the SEPS procedure. At 1 year, no additional clinical beneﬁt could be observed, when SEPS was
added to HL&S. It should therefore be emphasized that
SEPS or any other technique for perforator treatment
concomitant with initial superﬁcial axial reﬂux treatment
in C2 disease is not recommended.8
Despite these general ﬁndings, perforating veins may
occasionally be the source of primary varicose veins in
the absence of saphenous reﬂux. In a review of 835 limbs
referred to the vascular laboratory for CVD, isolated nonsaphenous origin reﬂux was found in 84 (10%).228 Ninety
percent of these limbs were CEAP class 1 t 3. Thigh perforators were found in 36 limbs (43%, although only 53% of
these demonstrated reﬂux) while 8% of limbs had reﬂux
arising from the vein of the popliteal fossa, and 4% from
knee or posterior tibial perforators.

GSV, Great saphenous vein; SSV, small saphenous vein.

For treatment of recurrent or residual veins due to
IPVs, several techniques of IPV occlusion were reported (Table XXI). Park et al used EVLA to occlude
the saphenous vein that had retrograde ﬂow from
an IPV of the thigh in 69 patients.229 This RCT
concluded that direct IPV treatment was not justiﬁed
since the technical success of the perforator ablation
was signiﬁcantly lower than just closure of the GSV
(76.5% vs 100%). The outcomes were not different
for either clinical success or complications between
the two groups (one with direct IPV treatment, one
without). FS for IPVs has also been analyzed in
conjunction with GSV ablation in a prospective trial231;
at 6 months it showed a closure rate of 75% for IPVs
vs a 98% closure of GSV. A prospective trial on 296
IPV closures in 112 patients compared three methods
(RFA, EVLA, and FS); most patients had C5 or C6
disease.223 Closure success was signiﬁcantly better
with RFA (73% P¼ .05) vs FS (57%), but failed to reach
signiﬁcance vs EVLA (61% P ¼ .09). More recently, a
technique for cyanoacrylate closure of perforating
veins was described in a retrospective series of 83
patients with C2 to C6 disease (27% C2 patients).
IPV closure rates were excellent, 96 % at 16 days
and 86% at 72 days. There were no DVTs, but
one patient needed antibiotic treatment for septic
thrombophlebitis.224

In summary, there is little to no randomized data for
the perforator treatment of choice for patients with
recurrent/persistent C2 disease, with an associated
IPV. When treatment of an IPV in a C2 patient is
desired, one should rely on experience, patient wishes,
and the availability of the various techniques reviewed
above.

Consensus statement
11.1.4. In patients who are symptomatic following
thermal or nonthermal ablation, we recommend early
DUS to exclude ARTE or DVT.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence A (high)
Rationale. Based on early reports of a high incidence
of thrombus extension at the SFJ232 (endothermal heat
induced thrombosis [EHIT]) following thermal ablation
of the GSV as well as ready access to ultrasound in
most venous clinics, screening for EHIT and DVT with
early DUS has become a common practice. EHIT is
commonly classiﬁed as thrombus extension to the AFJ
ort SPJ (I), involvement of <50% of the deep venous
lumen (II), involvement of >50% of the deep venous
lumen (III), or occlusive DVT (IV).233 As technology has
evolved over the last two decades, it has become clear
that junctional thrombus extension can occur after
nonthermal as well as thermal ablation. Accordingly,
we suggest that the term EHIT” be replaced by “ARTE.”
ARTE is an all-encompassing term that includes junctional extension associated with any ablation modality

including thermal, foam, mechanicochemical, and
cyanoacrylate ablation. This includes events previously
described as EHIT, postablation superﬁcial thrombus
extension, endovenous glue induced thrombosis, and
endovenous foam-induced thrombosis. To ensure consistency with previous reports, ARTE should be classiﬁed similar to EHIT (I-IV), although it must be
acknowledged that the clinical relevance of ARTE I and
likely even ARTE II is minimal. In the following discussion, the preferred terminology “ARTE” will be used
whenever possible, although the term “EHIT” will still
be used for studies speciﬁcally reporting this as an
outcome.
Previous guidelines from the AVF and SVS have suggested that venous duplex examination be performed
withing 1 week of the index procedure as an ungraded
best practice recommendation.233 The European Society
for Vascular Surgery has similarly considered ultrasound
surveillance after treatment of a saphenous trunk as a
consensus recommendation.56 However, despite this
guidance, most evidence suggests that the incidence

criteria developed by a Chest expert panel.237 No trials
randomizing patients to early ultrasound screening vs
observation have been performed, and are unlikely to
be done, given the large number of patients such a trial
would require achieving adequate power in the setting
of this low event rate. Assuming a pooled incidence of
all venous thromboembolic (VTE) events of 1.5%, a randomized clinical trial evaluating the ability of screening
DUS to reduce the incidence to 1% would require
approximately 15,500 patients.238 Furthermore, routine
ultrasound screening is not recommended even in populations at higher risk for VTE, including critically ill patients with coronavirus 2019 (ungraded consensus
recommendation)239; those undergoing orthopedic surgery (Grade 1B against),240 nonorthopedic surgery (Grade
2C against)241; and major trauma patients (Grade 2C
against).241 Based on the low incidence of thromboembolic complications in asymptomatic patients, the high
cost of routine DUS, the futility of performing randomized trials evaluating the utility of routine DUS, and

recommendations against screening in other higherrisk populations, we recommend against routine ultrasound surveillance following saphenous vein ablation in
low or average risk patients for thrombotic complications
Although evidence in randomized trials of routine ultrasound screening is lacking, the strength of our recommendation is 1 (strong) against screening in this patient
population, given the futility of performing such studies.
Evidence. A systematic review of 39 RCTs and 33 observational studies (31,663 patients in total) undergoing
routine DUS within 4 weeks of thermal or nonthermal
ablation of the GSV, SSV, or accessory veins, found a
very low incidence of EHIT (2.9%), DVT (0.26%), and PE
(0.03%).234 Most EHITs were types I and II, with the incidence of EHIT III to IV being only 0.5%. The pooled incidence of any VTE event (EHIT II-IV, DVT, and PE) was
1.32% (95% CI, 0.75%-2.02%) with signiﬁcant heterogeneity. The cost of routine ultrasound screening was estimated to be $61,292 per EHIT III or IV or DVT prevented.

Although randomized trials evaluating screening DUS
vs no ultrasound in asymptomatic patients after saphenous ablation have not been done, two such trials have
been performed in orthopedic patients.240 These trials
failed to demonstrate a beneﬁt to routine postoperative
screening, although major bleeding rates were higher
in the screening arms.
In one of the systematic reviews,234 nonthermal techniques were associated with a higher incidence of DVT
than thermal techniques (0.43 vs 0.23%; P ¼ .02),
although this difference was due to a higher incidence

of DVT in patients undergoing sclerotherapy
(Table XXII). Although total VTE events were higher

after thermal ablation or FS of the GSV. Among studies
evaluating the incidence of thromboembolic complications after thermal ablation (12 RCTs, 19 case series) or
FS (12 RCTs, 6 case series), the individual incidence of
EHIT, DVT, and PE was <1% for all treatment modalities
(RFA, laser ablation, FS). Differences between treatment
modalities were judged not to be clinically meaningful.
While thrombotic complications after isolated endovenous ablation are uncommon, the incidence in patients
undergoing open procedures such as HL&S and/or phlebectomy may be as high as 6.25%.39,244 Concomitant
phlebectomy of tributaries has been identiﬁed as an independent risk factor for VTE development.242 These patients may not identify VTE symptoms due to pain and
swelling associated with phlebectomy and many VTE
are asymptomatic.244 Thus, the role, or lack thereof, of
surveillance duplex in this patient population remains
to be deﬁned.

While we recommend against routine ultrasound
screening in asymptomatic, average-risk patients, clinicians should have a low threshold for obtaining such
studies in patients with postoperative symptoms suggestive of DVT and should consider such studies in
selected high-risk patients. The recommendation for
DUS in patients with postprocedure symptoms suggestive of DVT (1A) is based on a meta-analysis performed
by the American Society of Hematology in support of
their guidelines for evaluation of patients with a high
pretest probability of DVT.245 As discussed below
(guideline 11.2.1.), consistently deﬁning the risk factors
constituting a “high-risk” patient is more difﬁcult and requires clinical judgment. With respect to ablation technique, some randomized trials206,246 and metaanalyses234 have suggested a higher thrombotic risk
with FS, although such reports are not consistent across
studies.243 The clinical relevance of these ultrasound-

and requires further study. Data from at least one RCT

treated with anticoagulants or not.206
11.2. Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis
11.2.1. For high-risk patients undergoing endovenous
ablation, we suggest pharmacological thrombo
prophylaxis.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
Rationale. This guideline is consistent with that previously suggested by the AVF/SVS.233 Other guidelines
include those from the UK Royal Society of Medicine
which suggest preoperative assessment of all patients for
both VTE and bleeding risk with pharmacological prophylaxis for 7 to 14 days in intermediate-risk patients and
for 4 to 6 weeks in high-risk patients.247 The European
Society for Vascular Surgery recommends VTE risk
assessment in all patients with consideration of individualized thromboprophylaxis (Class IIa, Level B).56
Although the weight of the evidence does suggest
some beneﬁt to pharmacological thromboprophylaxis,
the evidence is difﬁcult to generalize due to the limited
magnitude of effect among those systematic reviews
reporting a beneﬁt of routine thromboprophylaxis (number needed to treat 25.4-172.4 for the prevention of DVT),
lack of risk stratiﬁcation in most studies, and signiﬁcant
heterogeneity in the results. In addition to the uncertain
value of routine thromboprophylaxis, there is little data
regarding optimal agents, dose, or duration of thromboprophylaxis if used. We therefore suggest pharmacoprophylaxis in high-risk patients, but with a low certainty of
evidence.
Evidence. Despite the very low incidence of thromboembolic events among patients undergoing endovenous ablation, one large systematic review did ﬁnd a
signiﬁcantly lower incidence of EHIT among those
receiving pharmacological prophylaxis (1.63% vs 3.04%;
P < .001).234 However, this was not a uniform ﬁnding
across individual studies and there was heterogeneity
in the prophylactic regimes used. Another systematic
review included 8 studies (3 RCTs, 5 cohort studies,
6479 patients) comparing pharmacoprophylaxis to no
prophylaxis following a variety of varicose vein procedures.41 Five studies evaluated prophylaxis after open
surgery and three after EVLA. The risk of DVT was lower
for endovenous procedures than for open surgery.
Prophylaxis was associated with a nonsigniﬁcant
reduction in the composite risk of DVT, PE, and superﬁcial venous thrombosis (pooled RR, 0.63; 95% CI,
0.04-10.43; P ¼ .74) and of DVT alone (pooled RR, 0.59,
0.08-4.60; P ¼ .61). There was signiﬁcant heterogeneity
in both results. Notably, conﬁning the analysis to randomized trials did show a signiﬁcant reduction in the

risk of DVT (0.22 vs 4.15%: RR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.02-0.13,
P < .00,001). Among the two studies reporting
bleeding risk, there was no difference among those
receiving or not receiving prophylaxis. Although a few
included studies evaluated the efﬁcacy of fondaparinux
and rivaroxaban as well as short vs extended courses of
prophylaxis, conclusions based on the available data
are difﬁcult.
A second broader meta-analysis included 47 randomized trials, 105 prospective cohort studies, 67 retrospective cohort studies, and 2 case control studies including
a total of 476, 266 patients undergoing a variety of superﬁcial endovenous interventions with exclusion of open
venous surgery.32 Notably, most studies excluded patients with a history of DVT. Although signiﬁcant heterogeneity precluded analysis of all study arms, among
prospective studies additional pharmacological prophylaxis reduced the incidence of DVT to 0.73% (95% CI,
0.52%-1.02%) from 1.31% (1.15%-1.48%) for mechanical
prophylaxis alone (compression stockings/bandages).
No signiﬁcant difference was noted between singledose and extended pharmacoprophylaxis. There were
no signiﬁcant differences in PE (0.14%, 0.07%-0.28% vs
0.16%, 0.15%-0.18%) or EHIT III to IV (0.35%, 0.09%-1.40%
vs 0.88%, 0.28%-2.70%) in comparing pharmacoprophylaxis to mechanical prophylaxis alone. Major bleeding
was quite rare (1 case) while minor bleeding was
observed in 0% to 10% of patients. Risk of bias was estimated to be high, and the Quality of Evidence was moderate among randomized trials and very low among
nonrandomized trials.
A systematic review included in the AVF/SVS EHIT
guidelines, which included only retrospective observational studies, failed to show a lower incidence of EHIT
with pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.233
11.2.2. For patients undergoing endovenous ablation
routine risk stratiﬁcation should be performed to assess
the need for periprocedural thromboprophylaxis.
Consensus statement.
Rationale and evidence. The literature reﬂects great
uncertainty regarding the value of risk assessment in
determining the need for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing superﬁcial venous interventions.32
Deﬁning the risk factors for DVT/EHIT after saphenous
ablation is unfortunately difﬁcult due to the very low
number of events and limited statistical power. Although
inconsistent across studies, suggested risk factors for
EHIT/DVT have included age, male gender, CEAP class,
personal or family history of VTE, known thrombophilia,
reduced mobility, obesity, hormone therapy, active cancer, concomitant procedures including sclerotherapy
and microphlebectomy, large GSV diameter, and a history of SVT.41,233,242,247,248 Given such uncertainty,
deciding who constitutes a high-risk patient requires
some degree of clinical judgment at present. Although
one single-center study has shown the Caprini risk

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders

assessment score to be associated with the development
of EHIT (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.24-2.0; P ¼ .0002), only ultrasound identiﬁed EHIT I to II were found in this study and
it remains unclear whether the Caprini score is predictive
of clinically relevant thrombotic events after superﬁcial
venous intervention.248
Currently, no speciﬁc guidelines address the role of VTE
risk stratiﬁcation in the ambulatory surgery setting. Data
from patients undergoing both inpatient and outpatient
procedures suggests that identiﬁcation of patient and
procedural related risk factors allows for identiﬁcation
of 15- to 20-fold variation in VTE risk. Individualized risk
stratiﬁcation allows for the identiﬁcation of low-risk patients in whom the risk-beneﬁt ratio is unfavorable, and
potentially for the identiﬁcation of patients at high VTE
risk in whom the beneﬁt of receiving chemical chemoprophylaxis outweighs the attendant bleeding risk. A
widely accepted risk threshold is a calculated VTE risk
of 3%, assuming a two-fold reduction in VTE events
compared with expected bleeding events from administration of an anticoagulant.241 Currently, no VTE risk
assessment model (RAM) has been validated in patients
undergoing varicose vein procedures.
Indirect evidence suggests that risk stratifying patients
undergoing varicose vein procedures may have potential
beneﬁts. Namely, among patients undergoing a variety of
ambulatory surgical procedures, those undergoing procedures for varicose vein procedures are at the highest
risk for development of VTE.249 Second, variations in
VTE rate among patients undergoing venous procedures
have been identiﬁed according to patient and procedure
related characteristics. For instance, patients undergoing
open surgery or longer operations are at greater risk at
developing VTE.250 Third, limited evidence suggests
that those with a higher composite VTE RAM score,
such as that used in the Caprini RAM, have an increased
VTE and ARTE risk.251 Finally, a recent meta-analysis suggested that in patients undergoing inpatient and outpatient surgical procedures (including those undergoing
venous procedures) with a Caprini score of $7 beneﬁted
from chemoprophylaxis in terms of VTE risk reduction
without an increase in bleeding.252 This data highlights
the critical need to determine from a speciﬁc VTE RAM
the threshold at which chemical thromboprophylaxis is
favorable for the patient undergoing outpatient axial
and/or tributary bed treatment. Future studies should
likely focus on clinically relevant venous thromboembolic events (DVT, PE) and should include some measure
of risk.
11.3. Treatment of varicose vein procedure related
DVT and ARTE
In patients with DVT after endovenous ablation, we
endorsed the recommendations of Stevens et al,
Antithrombotic Therapy for VTE Disease: Second Update of the CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel
Report. Chest. 2021; 160(6): e545-e608.253 The

evidence base for these guidelines was adopted
without review.
11.3.1. For patients with acute isolated distal DVT after varicose vein procedure, without severe symptoms
or risk factors for extension we suggest serial imaging
of the deep veins for 2 weeks.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)
11.3.2. For patients with isolated distal DVT after varicose vein procedure and severe symptoms or risk factors for extension we suggest anticoagulation.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
11.3.3. For patients with acute proximal DVT after
varicose vein procedure, we recommend anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant (over a vitamin K
antagonist).
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)
11.3.4. For patients with symptomatic ARTE after
endovenous ablation, we recommend anticoagulation
with a direct oral anticoagulant (over a vitamin K
antagonist).
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
11.4.1. For patients with asymptomatic ARTE III and
IV after endovenous ablation, anticoagulation with a
direct oral anticoagulant (over a vitamin K antagonist)
should be performed.
Consensus statement
11.4.2. For patients who receive anticoagulation for
ARTE following endovenous ablation, treatment
should be continued until the thrombus retracts.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. As discussed, routine screening of asymptomatic, average-risk patients for ARTE/DVT is not recommended and asymptomatic ARTE/DVT in these
patients should rarely be diagnosed. The majority of
ARTEs are ARTE I and II,234 which is of minimal clinical
relevance. Although previous guidelines233 have recommended either no treatment (EHIT I), weekly surveillance
(EHIT II), or consideration of antiplatelet vs anticoagulant
therapy (high-risk patients with EHIT II), these should be
rarely encountered in the absence of routine ultrasound
surveillance. ARTE III and IV are presumably more likely
to be symptomatic and to be suspected based on
accepted clinical indications. Although it is not entirely
clear that the natural history of ARTE III to IV is the same
as DVT,233 a conservative approach would suggest treatment similar to established guidelines for DVT treatment.253 However, as the natural history of ARTE is not
well-documented, the value of alternative approaches
such as anticoagulation until thrombus resolution as
observed by ultrasound cannot be entirely excluded.
Given the uncertain beneﬁt, treatment of symptomatic
ARTE according to established guidelines for acute DVT

54

Gloviczki et al

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders
January 2024

is a weak suggestion. Furthermore, as this evidence is
extrapolated from current guidelines for the management of DVT and is therefore indirect, for the management of ARTE the level of evidence has been
downgraded to C.
Further research is needed regarding the natural history
of ARTE. More data is particularly needed regarding the
value of anticoagulation vs serial follow-up and the duration of anticoagulation in treated patients. Given the uncertainty of the evidence, at present, duration of
anticoagulation should be at the judgment of the
clinician.
Evidence. The management of symptomatic DVT is
generally guided by the Chest guidelines for Antithrombotic Therapy for VTE Disease253 and the reader is
referred to that manuscript for the supporting evidence.
Unfortunately, the data regarding the management of
ARTE are substantially less robust. The evidence
regarding the treatment of ultrasound detected (most
presumably asymptomatic) ARTE is derived from small
case series and retrospective studies and is accordingly
quite variable. One systematic review evaluated the
management of ARTE detected by routine ultrasound
screening in 24 studies for which the treatment was
described.236 Among the 25 included studies, anticoagulation was the most common treatment for EHIT, with
two studies reporting selective use of antiplatelet therapy and seven studies reporting observation only. Irrespective of treatment, there were no reports of
propagation or embolization of EHIT II to IV once identiﬁed. The authors concluded that the natural history of
EHIT is generally benign (Table XXIII).
12. Management of SVT in patients with varicose and
nonvaricose veins
Guideline 12. Address the management of SVT in patients who have not recently undergone superﬁcial
venous interventions. The management of EHIT and
other thrombotic complications of superﬁcial venous interventions were presented in Guidelines 11.
12.1.1. For patients with SVT of the main saphenous
trunks and tributaries above the knee >3 cm from
the SFJ and $5 cm in length, whether or not associated with varicose veins, we recommend fondaparinux
2.5 mg subcutaneously daily for 45 days; alternatively,
rivaroxaban 10 mg/d for 45 days may be appropriate
for patients unwilling or unable to perform subcutaneous injections.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence: A (high)
12.1.2. For patients with SVT of the main saphenous
trunks #3 cm from the SFJ, treatment with full anticoagulation for a minimum of 6 weeks should be continued.
Consensus statement.
12.1.3 For patients with SVT of the main saphenous
trunks we suggest against using prophylactic or

therapeutic dose low-molecular weight heparin
(LMWH) and nonsteroid anti-inﬂammatory drugs
(NSAIDs). While both have been found to reduce
SVT pain and extension, they have failed to prevent
VTE. If NSAIDs are used for treatment of short
segment distal SVT, surveillance with DUS for VTE
extension is recommended due to the high prevalence of concomitant DVT.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence: A (high)
12.1.4. For selected patients with isolated thrombosis
of varicose tributaries or limited involvement of the
GSV, we suggest phlebectomy as a safe alternative.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)
12.1.5. In patients with saphenous thrombophlebitis,
ablation should be performed once the inﬂammation
has resolved if there is evidence of pathologic reﬂux
on DUS.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Despite recognition that superﬁcial thrombophlebitis, also known as SVT, is more common than
DVT, there is less awareness of its associated morbidity
and little consensus on its management.254 While traditionally thought of as benign, recent studies have highlighted its association with DVT and PE if left untreated.
Studies show that SVT may progress to DVT in 6% to 44%
of patients; 20% to 33% may have asymptomatic PE; and
2% to 13% may have symptomatic PE. Superﬁcial venous
thrombosis involving the saphenous trunk has the
greatest association with VTE.34 Although the majority of
SVT occurs in varicose veins, SVT in nonvaricose veins
confers greater morbidity and few studies have stratiﬁed
treatment based on this distinction.34 Several therapies
including surgery, compression stockings, and nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aim to reduce
pain and inﬂammation, however, given the associated
progression to VTE, anticoagulation is recommended. Of
note, the application of warm compresses to the site of
SVT has never been evaluated in any study.
Evidence. These recommendations are supported by
two recent systematic reviews34,35 (Table XXIV). The
2018 Cochrane review included 33 studies involving 7296
patients with SVT of the legs.34 Treatments evaluated
included fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, LMWH, unfractionated heparin, NSAIDS, compression stockings, and
topical, intramuscular, or intravenous treatment as well
as surgical thrombectomy or ligation. A minority of
studies compared treatment to placebo and most
studies were small and of poor quality. Further, most
studies excluded patients with SVT that was within 3 cm
of the SFJ. The recommendations are primarily based on
one large placebo controlled RCT of 3002 participants
who received fondaparinux and demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduction in symptomatic VTE, SVT extension, and
SVT recurrence in comparison with placebo. Major

Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders

bleeding was infrequent in both groups. A second systematic review and meta-analysis included seventeen
studies and 6862 patients with SVT and conﬁrmed that
fondaparinux achieved the lowest rate of progression to
DVT and PE without conclusions about other treatment
due to low quality evidence.35 In the Surprise study, patients with SVT and one or more risk factors for VTE were
randomized to 45 days of fondaparinux or rivaroxaban
10 mg.257 The results suggested that rivaroxaban was as
effective as fondaparinux, however, the study was not
powered to prove noninferiority. A call for further studies
was prompted by the nonsigniﬁcant increase in the primary composite outcome as well as by an increase in
clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in the rivaroxaban
group. These recommendations are similar to those,
published recently on management of SVT in the CHEST
guidelines.253
Low-quality evidence in one study found that prophylactic LMWH reduced extension of SVT (statistically signiﬁcant), but did not reduce incidence of VTE, while
therapeutic LMWH evaluated in one study reduced
both SVT extension (statistically signiﬁcant) and progression to VTE, but improvement was less signiﬁcant at
3 month follow-up due to a catch-up phenomenon.34
NSAIDS were also found in one study to reduce SVT
extension (statistically signiﬁcant).258 However, there
were no differences in the resolution of local symptoms
and signs of SVT and in the incidence of VTE. While there
were no major bleeding episodes recorded in either the
NSAID or placebo groups, indomethacin increased the
rate of adverse effects.259 NSAIDs have also been found
to increase the risk of gastric pain three-fold compared
with placebo.258,259
Compared with elastic stockings alone, one study
showed that HL&S plus elastic stockings reduced the
risk of SVT extension and recurrence (RR, 0.09; 95% CI,
0.01-0.64) and was associated with a lower, statistically
not signiﬁcant, incidence of VTE (RR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.081.78).260 However, most studies evaluating surgery and
topical treatments did not report SVT progression, VTE,
or adverse events.34
A recent analysis from the RIETE registry of patients
with thrombosis involving main trunk of the GSV within
3 cm of the SFJ compared those treated with full dose
fondaparinux or LMWH followed by VKA (227 patients)
to those (147 patients) who received prophylactic doses
of fondaparinux or intermediate dose LMWH.255 Those
receiving full-dose anticoagulation received a longer
course of treatment and all patients were followed for
3 months. There was no difference in the incidence of
VTE or recurrent SVT between the groups or in the safety
outcomes of major bleeding or clinically nonmajor
bleeding. The authors concluded that these ﬁndings
are hypothesis generating and support a trial evaluating
the efﬁcacy of preventative dose anticoagulation in

comparison with therapeutic anticoagulation for treatment of SVT approaching the SFJ.
There is a paucity of studies speciﬁcally evaluating
the management of SVT in patients with varicose
veins. In a prospective observational study of 195 limbs
with SVT and varicose veins treated with surgery or
anticoagulation, there was no difference in the primary composite outcome of SVT extension/recurrence, incidence of DVT or symptomatic PE.256 The
authors concluded that urgent surgery is not associated with reduction in the incidence of VTE
compared with anticoagulation alone but could be
safely performed in selected patients with isolated
thrombosis of varicose tributaries or limited involvement of the saphenous trunk.
A single-center randomized trial of 73 patients
compared the use of thigh-high 23 to 32 mm Hg
compression stockings to no compression stockings for
3 weeks in patients with isolated SVT of the legs who
all received prophylactic dose LMWH with or without
NSAIDS.261 The addition of compression stockings
resulted in no signiﬁcant difference in reduction of
pain, consumption of analgesics, thrombus length, skin
erythema, D-dimer, or QOL. However, patients wearing
compression had signiﬁcantly faster thrombus regression at 7 days.
The recurrence rate of SVT is between 10 and 20%. One
large case series of SVT patients described a recurrence
rate of 15% among 221 patients.262 In modern times
with widespread application of anticoagulant therapies,
the risk of recurrence or VTE is w6%, with the highest
risk occurring among patients with previous episodes
of SVT and long segment thrombosis.263 Although not
addressed by a randomized control trial, best practice
would include informing patient of the risk of recurrent
SVT and offering surgical or endovascular therapy for
the treatment of symptomatic recanalized varices and
axial reﬂux (if present in the recanalized saphenous
vein after completion of evidence based antithrombotic
therapy).
13. Management of bleeding varicose veins.
13.1. For patients presenting with acute bleeding
from varicose veins, leg elevation, direct compression,
and sclerotherapy should be attempted before suture
ligation to control bleeding.
Consensus statement.
13.2. For patients with bleeding due to varicose veins,
prompt referral to a venous specialist should be done.
Consensus statement.
13.3. For patients who presented with bleeding from
varicose veins, and bleeding has been controlled, evaluation for superﬁcial venous incompetence and appropriate intervention should be done to control venous
hypertension and reduce the risk of recurrent
hemorrhage.

56

Consensus statement.
13.4. Patients with varicose veins or venous ulcerations should be counseled on the possibility of venous
bleeding and their families, caregivers, or friends
educated regarding leg elevation and simple compression techniques to control severe bleeding.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. The true incidence of bleeding from varicose
veins is unknown due to under-reporting but appears to
occur in approximately 4% of patients presenting with
varicose veins.264,265 Bleeding often arises from small
veins at the ankle with surrounding skin pigmentation
and induration or following exacerbation of a venous
ulcer leading to erosion of veins underlying the ulcer
bed.266 Patients may report bleeding when the varicosities are exposed to warm water (in the shower or bathing), causing the veins to vasodilate, or bleeding can
occur because of minor trauma. Patients with right heart
failure or cardiomyopathy may also experience intermittent, often heavy, bleeding from dilated veins.
Regardless of the cause, when a varicose vein ruptures,
profuse bleeding can occur due to associated venous
hypertension.
Although most bleeding associated with varicose veins
is not associated with hypotension and does not require
transfusion,267 fatal hemorrhage is an uncommon, but
not entirely rare event.266 Most cases of fatal variceal
hemorrhage have come from autopsy reports. A 2011
report documented <100 fatalities over several decades.268 Twenty-three fatalities were reported in England and Wales in 2001.266 A systematic review
including 17 articles found that deaths secondary to
bleeding varicose veins accounted for 0.01% of autopsy
cases.269 The victims were patients aged 60 to $90 years
of age with no gender discrimination. Deaths due to
hemorrhage occurred in older persons who lived alone,
were mobility impaired, had skin fragility or an ulcer
located near the malleolus, were on anticoagulation or
antiplatelet medication, or had a comorbidity such as
dementia or liver failure. These rare case reports describe
pulsatile bleeding both from the thin-wall veins themselves and from exposed veins in a venous ulcer bed
leading to hypovolemic shock and death, especially in
the presence of ischemic heart disease.270 Another
single-center study found that patients with bleeding
episodes had decreased access to basic ﬁrst aid or hemorrhage control techniques.264
As many of the fatal hemorrhagic events can be prevented, it is critical that patients be asked about prior
bleeding episodes, be warned about the possibility,
and be instructed in ﬁrst aid and hemorrhage control
techniques, such as leg elevation and direct compression on the bleeding varicose veins. The danger of
applying venous tourniquets and increasing venous
pressure has often been emphasized in the literature.266

Evidence. Both because of the infrequency of
bleeding events and the difﬁculty in leaving such patients untreated, no studies comparing intervention to
conservative management have been performed. However, very limited evidence does suggest that fatal hemorrhage usually occurs after a previous untreated
episode of bleeding266 and there is general consensus
that patients should be treated after the ﬁrst episode of
hemorrhage.267,271 Furthermore, there is evidence from
single-center series that superﬁcial venous intervention
reduces recurrent hemorrhage. Selection of an appropriate treatment modality is somewhat dependent of
the patient’s venous anatomy and size of the bleeding
vein. Among 5 patients reported in one series, acute
control of venous hemorrhage was successfully achieved with direct injection of 1% polidocanol foam into
the bleeding varicosity with or without FS (3% polidocanol) of the associated saphenous trunk. No recurrent
bleeding was noted after a mean follow-up of
17.4 months.272 A larger series reported successful acute
control of bleeding in 72 patients treated with FS.271 In
comparison with 52 patients treated with simple suture
ligation, FS was associated with faster wound healing (7
vs 14 days; P < .001) and a lower risk of recurrent
bleeding at 12 months (0% vs 23%, P < .001). Others
have similarly reported excellent control of bleeding
from smaller veins (<1 mm) with sclerotherapy, while
bleeding from larger veins was successfully controlled
with high ligation, stripping, and phlebectomy. Recurrent bleeding was noted in only 1 of 14 patients (7%)
after a mean follow-up of 21.3 months.267 Venous
ablation has been used more recently in patients with
varicosities, with small series (n ¼ 13) demonstrating
85% of patients to be free from recurrent bleeding at a
mean follow-up of 2.26 years.265
Although the supportive evidence is quite limited, the
literature does suggest that acute bleeding is optimally
managed with sclerotherapy, while prevention of recurrence may warrant ablation of any truncal venous
incompetence.
14. Management of superﬁcial vein aneurysms
14.1. For patients with superﬁcial truncal vein aneurysm, located within 3 cm of the SFJ or SPJ, open surgical excision, with high proximal and distal ligations
should be performed. If symptomatic saphenous reﬂux
is present, endovenous or open surgical ablation (phlebectomy or limited stripping) of the distal saphenous
vein should be performed.
Consensus statement.
14.2. For patients with an asymptomatic superﬁcial
truncal vein aneurysm, located >3 cm distal to the
SFJ, endovenous ablation alone should be performed.
Thromboprophylaxis in these patients reduces the
risk of VTE.

Gloviczki et al

Volume 12, Number 1

Consensus statement. 14.3. Patients with symptomatic, thrombosed or large (>3 cm) aneurysms in the superﬁcial veins are best treated with surgical excision.
Rationale. Focal dilation of the saphenous veins (GSV,
SSV, AAGSV, or PAGSV) that measures $20 mm for
GSV and 15 mm for SSV, or has a diameter that is three
times the upper limit of the average saphenous diameter
is considered an aneurysm.273 Most patients are asymptomatic or have a palpable lump at the groin or in the
popliteal fossa.274 Many patients present only with
symptoms of varicosity or CVI.158,275,276 Patients occasionally complain of a tender lump,277 that can be ﬁrm, if
the aneurysm is thrombosed.278 Evaluation with duplex
scanning is usually satisfactory, but congenital superﬁcial
truncal vein aneurysms may occur in patients with
venous malformations (Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome)279
and saphenous aneurysms may occasionally mimic
femoral hernia,274 synovial,280,281 or Baker cyst282 or
venous leiomyosarcoma.283 In these patients further
evaluation with computed tomography or magnetic
resonance imaging is warranted. When the saphenous
aneurysm is near the femoral or popliteal vein, open
surgical excision is indicated, with ligation or oversewing
of a dilated proximal saphenous stump. In patients with
symptomatic saphenous reﬂux, endovenous ablation,
tumescent anesthesia aided phlebectomy or limited
stripping of the distal segment is performed. If the
aneurysm is located >3 cm distal to the SFJ or SPJ,
permitting safe proximal occlusion with endovenous
techniques, endovenous ablation alone is frequently
possible and safe, although most large (>3 cm) or
symptomatic, thrombosed aneurysms are better treated
with surgical excision at any location. There is also signiﬁcant risk of sural nerve injury, when thermal ablation is
used to treat proximal SSV aneurysm. Ablation of
saphenous aneurysms within 3 cm. of the SFJ and SPJ
should not be treated with UGFS due to the increased
risk of propagation of larger amount of foam into the
deep venous system.
Evidence. Similar to deep vein aneurysms,284-286
there is evidence that saphenous vein aneurysms
carry a risk of VTE.287-289 Treatment is recommended
whether or not there is thrombus in the aneurysm
sac. Conservative therapy with elastic compression for
small aneurysms and in those who are not candidates for intervention decreases the risk of thrombotic complications. Most reports describe open
surgical excision of saphenous aneurysms, with proximal and distal ligation or distal saphenous ablation.274,277,278,287-290 In two smaller series of mostly
small GSV aneurysms (<3 cm in size), located close to
the SFJ, endovenous ablation alone was used, without
proximal high ligation.158,276
, et al276 treated 11 limbs of 8 patients with
Pavlovic
RFA alone, without high ligation. All GSV aneurysms
were located near the SFJ, distal to the preterminal

valve. Median aneurysm diameter was 21 mm (interquartile range, 17.2-23.4 mm), all patients had incompetent GSV and CVD. The catheter tip was placed at
1 to 2 cm from the SFJ, within the aneurysmal
segment. Extra tumescent anesthetic and compression was used, and the ﬁrst segment was treated
with three cycles using RFA. Thromboprophylaxis
was given for 7 days. At a median follow-up of 8 years
median saphenous diameter was reduced to 5.8 mm,
the aneurysmal segment was either completely or
partly obliterated, and, if partly patent, always had
an antegrade ﬂow. One patient (9.1%) had EHIT III
despite thrombosis prophylaxis.
In a prospective study, Hamann et al158 treated 15
limbs of 13 patients with GSV aneurysm, located within
2 cm of the SFJ. Four aneurysms were surgically
excised, with proximal ligation, because they were
located near the SFJ and had a diameter >3 cm. The
other 11 were treated with endovenous ablation alone.
A generous amount of tumescent anesthesia was
used to diminish the aneurysm as much as possible.
Additional energy was applied in the aneurysmal
segment, either 100 Joules/cm for EVLA or 3 energy cycles for RFA. No patient had DVT or thrombus extension into the femoral vein. At 1 year, none of the
aneurysms were visible on duplex. Three patients
needed retreatment for partial or segmental recanalization, with good result. Thromboprophylaxis was given to
patients with a history of VTE or SVT.
Further experience with larger number of patients is
needed to recommend endovenous ablation alone for
treatment of large
aneurysms or
for those
located <3 cm to the SFJ or SPJ. One of the main reasons
for this study is that current North American guidelines
suggest placement of the tip of thermal ablation catheters $2 cm distal to the SFJ.

APPENDIX (online only).
1. VADs for CVD
This section reviews brieﬂy the scientiﬁc evidence supporting the clinical beneﬁt of Hydroxyethylrutosides, calcium dobesilate, Horse chestnut extract, Red vine leaf
extract and Sulodexide for patients with varicose veins
and CVD. None of these products are approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration for use in patients
with venous disease.
Clinical beneﬁt of hydroxyethylrutosides.
Rationale. Hydroxyethylrutosides are composed by
one or several bioﬂavonoids obtained from hydroxyethylation of rutoside (a combination of ﬂavonol quercetin
and disaccharide rutinose). Hydroxyrutoside is a potent
inhibitor of inﬂammation-related gene expression, and
production of inﬂammatory cytokines (nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1, IL-6) in macrophages and
neutrophils.101
Evidence. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 15
trials with 1643 patients17 evaluated the effect of
hydroxyrutoside,
with
or
without
compression
bandaging vs placebo, with or without compression
bandaging, and hydroxyrutoside vs compression
bandaging alone. Compared with placebo, a signiﬁcant
but modest reduction of pain, leg heaviness and cramps
were reported. The trials were of limited quality.
Clinical beneﬁt of calcium dobesilate.
Rationale.
Calcium
dobesilate
(calcium
2,5dihydroxybenzene-sulphonate) is a synthetic drug used
for CVI, hemorrhoids, and diabetic retinopathy. Experimental studies claimed a protective action against
oxidative stress in varicose veins291 and other beneﬁcial
effects such as regulation of apotosis,292 increased nitric
oxide synthase activity, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, diminished capillary fragility and hyperpermeability, reduction of platelet aggregation and
blood viscosity.101
Evidence. An RCT293 demonstrated improvement of
plethysmographic measurements after 6-month treatment. However, comparison vs placebo in another 3month trial294 failed to show a signiﬁcant difference for
edema, symptoms of CVD, and QOL, with exception of
QOL at 12-month follow-up, better in calcium dobesilate
group. A more recent trial with calcium dobesilate vs
MPFF295 reported similar and signiﬁcant pain reduction
in both groups. In an RCT vs placebo in patients with
CEAP C3-4,296 calcium dobesilate signiﬁcantly decreased
leg volume (P ¼ .0002) and improved symptoms
(discomfort, heavy legs, tired legs, tingling, itching and
cramps (P < .05).297
A meta-analysis performed in 200418 found 10 RCTs
(778 patients) comparing calcium dobesilate with placebo for CVI. The methodological quality was good in 3
RCTs (608 patients). Calcium dobesilate decreased night
cramps and discomfort more than placebo with number
of patients needed to be treated of 4 (95% CI, 3-7) vs 8

(95% CI, 4-50). Greater improvement was reported in severe CVD as compared with the mild disease, for leg volume decrease, pain, heaviness, malleolar swelling, and
paresthesia. Interestingly, no dose effect was noticed:
1000 mg was as effective as 1500 mg/d. A meta-analysis15
found calcium dobesilate effectiveness comparable to
Ruscus extracts in reducing foot volume and ankle circumferences. Data from a postmarketing surveillance
report 1974 to 1998, the international literature (19702003) and periodic safety update report 1995 to 2003
from the French Regulatory authorities, was reviewed
to assess the safety proﬁle of calcium dobesilate.298
Adverse events included fever (26%), gastrointestinal disorders (12.5%), skin reactions (8.2%), arthralgia (4.3%), and
agranulocytosis (4.3%). No death was related to calcium
dobesilate administration. The authors concluded that
the adverse events’ risk with calcium dobesilate is low
despite 13 known cases of agranulocytosis in patients
treated by calcium dobesilate.
Clinical beneﬁt of horse chestnut extract.
Rationale. Horse chestnut extract contains escin, a
mixture of triterpene saponins, and some benzopyrones.
Escin has a veno-contractile properties and a protective
effect on endothelium, through the increased production of nitric oxide.299
Evidence. A Cochrane review300 covered electronic
data bases search and material collected from manufacturers of horse chestnut extract products with published and unpublished studies and non-English articles.
The included RCTs in patients with CVI compared efﬁcacy and safety of oral horse chestnut extract monopreparations with placebo, or reference therapy. Assessment of symptoms shown signiﬁcantly better than placebo efﬁcacy in improvement of leg pain (7 RCT).
Evaluation of the leg volume change in 6 placebocontrolled trials reported a 32.1 mL weighted mean difference (95% CI, 13.49-50.72) in favor of horse chestnut
extract. This efﬁcacy was found comparable to
compression stockings in another trial.301 The treatment
safety was excellent. The authors concluded that “horse
chestnut extract is an efﬁcacious and safe short-term
treatment for CVI.” The most recent systematic review
and meta-analysis on VAD effectiveness15 conﬁrmed
value of horse chestnut extract therapy, although the
other VAD were found more effective, MPFF in reducing
leg volume and pain, and improving QOL; calcium
dobesilate and Ruscus extracts in reducing foot volume
and ankle circumference.
Clinical beneﬁt of red vine leaf extract.
Rationale. Red vine leaf extract was found to improve
cutaneous microcirculation in patients with CVI, thanks
to the increased nitric oxide synthase and decreased
oxidative stress.302
Evidence. A review paper estimated a statistically signiﬁcant and clinically relevant efﬁcacy of red vine leaf
extract.303 on leg edema reduction assessed by

volumetry, and on symptoms (heaviness, tingling and
pain). Three double-blind vs placebo RCTs support these
ﬁndings. One304 crossover trial vs placebo, in 71 patients
with CVI Widmer grade I to II, reported a signiﬁcantly
decreased leg circumference (P < .0001) and an
increased cutaneous microvascular blood ﬂow (P <
.0001) as well as transcutaneous oxygen pressure (P <
.0001). Another RCT, in 260 patients CEAP C2 to C4,305
evaluated leg volume by water displacement volumetry
and noted marked dose-dependent difference favoring
AS 195 group (P < .001), parallel to the ankle/calf
circumference pattern (P < .001). The third trial
conﬁrmed previous results in 248 patients with varicose
veins and CEAP C3 to C4a.306 Pain improvement and
decrease of the leg volume assessed by water displacement volumetry vs placebo were signiﬁcant; P ¼ .047 and
P ¼ .0268 respectively. Safety of AS 195 treatment was
excellent. In a recent systematic review307 signiﬁcant
improvement of symptoms and edema was observed in
some studies. The safety of Red vine leaf extract treatment was excellent.
Clinical beneﬁt of sulodexide.
Rationale. Sulodexide contain a puriﬁed glycosaminoglycan mixture of low molecular weight heparin (80%)
and dermatan sulfate (20%), components of glycocalyx
glycoproteins.101 Protection of glycocalyx integrity is
essential in the preservation of the vascular endothelial
function and mitigation of the inﬂammatory reaction.
Evidence. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 13
studies with sulodexide19 included 1901 participants with
CVD at any stage of the disease, classiﬁed or nonclassiﬁed,
was considered. Sulodexide decreased the intensity of
pain, cramps, heaviness, edema, total symptom score and
reduced inﬂammatory mediators in patients with CVD.
In a meta-analysis comparing efﬁcacy of different
VADs15 sulodexide was included only in a single network
meta-analysis for the proportion of patients with

complete ulcer healing and it showed to have the highest probability of being the best treatment (48%)
compared with pentoxifylline (37%) and MPFF (16%).
The assessment of the sulodexide efﬁcacy on venous
symptoms was done in the meta-analysis of 18 observational studies showing a signiﬁcant improvement of
pain, feeling of swelling, heaviness and paresthesia
measured by Likert scales.
In one randomized trial endovenous laser treatment of
the GSV and phlebectomy were followed by sulodexide
twice daily for 1 month and compared with the control
group with no adjunctive pharmacotherapy. compared
with the control group, in the main group there was a
statistically signiﬁcant decrease in VCSS and improvement in the QOL assessed by CIVIQ-20. The microcirculation of the skin was assessed by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry.
Laboratory examinations measured markers of endothelial dysfunction (homocysteine, von Willebrand factor,
PAI1, soluble (s)E-selectin, sP-selectin, sICAM-1, and
sVCAM-1). An increase in tissue perfusion, and an
improvement in the microcirculation was found in the
sulodexide group.308
A prospective, multicenter, RCT assessed sulodexide as
adjunctive treatment to the sclerotherapy. Group A (n ¼
354 patients) received sulodexide twice a day for 7 days
before sclerotherapy and group B (n ¼ 366 patients)
received standard sclerotherapy alone. Polidocanol and
20 to 30 mm Hg compression stockings were used in
both groups for 7 days. After 1 month, the incidence of
hyperpigmentation was 8.7% in group A and 14.8% in
group B (P ¼ .01). Group A developed an average area
