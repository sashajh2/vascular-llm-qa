Introduction
“Do we not always find the diseases of the populace traceable to defects in society?” - Rudolf
Virchow
Multiple studies have demonstrated significant disparities exist across the spectrum of vascular
disease including prevalence, treatment, and disease outcomes. Furthermore, it has been
demonstrated that social determinants of health (SDoH), comprising multiple factors including
patient socioeconomic status, race or ethnicity, gender, and geographic location, can have
potent effects on health outcomes. There are some estimates that SDoH account for 8090 percent of the modifiable contributors to healthy outcomes for a population, and must
be addressed in order to rectify persistent healthcare disparities. (Remington, Catlin, and
Gennuso 2015)
Vascular surgeons treat patients with advanced atherosclerosis and diabetes, which are diseases that disproportionately affect vulnerable and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients.
Given this reality, it is important for vascular surgeons to have a strong foundational understanding of the social determinants of health and health disparities that lead to unequal care
among patients. This textbook chapter does not intend to be comprehensive, but rather an
introduction to scope of health disparities in vascular surgery.

Health Disparities in Vascular Surgery
Race, Ethnicity, and Structural Racism
There is an abundance of literature documenting racial and ethnic disparities across the
spectrum of vascular disease including thoracic and aortic aneurysms, carotid disease, and
hemodialysis access. However, disparities spanning the disease continuum of peripheral artery
disease (PAD) is one of the most robustly studied areas in surgery disparities research.
A scientific statement published by the American Heart Association outlines the scope of
health disparities in PAD. Looking at prevalence, it has been demonstrated Black patients
have a higher prevalence of PAD, even after controlling for traditional cardiovascular risk
factors. Prevalence of PAD among other racial and ethnic groups is less documented, but
limited evidence suggests higher rates of PAD among Cuban populations especially when
compared to other Hispanic and Latinx groups. Risk factor control and preventative measures
are important management tools to prevent the progression of PAD to critical limb threatening
ischemia (CLTI) and limb loss. However, Black and Hispanic patients are more likely to present
with hypercholesterolemia but less likely to be prescribed an aspirin or statin. (Allison et al.
2023)
Looking at PAD outcomes, studies have found that patients identifying as Black have nearly
twofold greater rate of leg amputation, even after controlling for relevant confounders. Additionally, Black patients who undergo amputation are less likely to have any limb-related
admission, suggesting less aggressive limb salvage among this population. Higher rates of
diabetes and deep soft tissue infection are strongly correlated with the higher burden of amputation in Black patients. (Hackler, Hamburg, and White Solaru 2021)
Due to structural racism, racial and ethnic minority patients are often disproportionately
burdened with socioeconomic barriers. One study evaluating the etiology of health care access
among Hispanic patients found that Hispanic patients were more likely to delay medical care
for socioeconomic reasons including inability to afford costs, time away from employment, and
childcare issues. (Bazikian et al. 2023)

Access and Care Delivery:
Millions of Americans live in communities considered ‘healthcare deserts,’ where they lack adequate access to important healthcare services including primary care, hospitals, emergency services, pharmacies, trauma centers, and low-cost health centers. (“Mapping Healthcare Deserts:
80,” n.d.) Many healthcare deserts are often concentrated in rural locations highlighting the
unique geographical challenges that these patients face. Furthermore, certain vascular diseases
including chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) require specialized, multidisciplinary care
for optimal management, but many communities are considered “vascular deserts” in which
there is inadequate access to expert vascular surgery care. (DiLosa et al. 2023) Addressing the

28

challenges posed by healthcare and vascular deserts, particularly in rural areas, is crucial for
ensuring equitable access to essential services. Continued investigation and investment into
these issues are imperative to develop effective solutions that can bridge the healthcare gaps
and provide optimal care.

Sexual and Gender Minorities:
A growing body of research explores the impact of sex and gender on various aspects of
vascular disease. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 236 studies demonstrates an association between female sex or gender and poorer outcomes in individuals with Abdominal
Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) and Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD). (Lee et al. 2022) It has been
demonstrated that women have higher risk of AAA rupture, prolonged lengths of stay, and
decreased survival following both elective and emergent AAA repair. (Dillavou, Muluk, and
Makaroun 2006) The lack of representation of women in large-scale vascular surgery clinical
trials has also become an area of increasing concern, given the pivotal role these studies play in
shaping the standard of care and management guidelines. Despite efforts to enhance women’s
participation in clinical trials, evidence suggests persistent underrepresentation in randomized control trials, potentially limiting the broader applicability of their findings. (Hoel et al.
2009) The multifactorial nature of this underrepresentation, infuenced by factors like patient
preference, bias, and local demographics, necessitates sustained efforts to achieve diverse recruitment and ensure a more comprehensive understanding of vascular disease across diverse
patient populations.

Veteran Populations:
Military veterans represent a unique population with distinct healthcare needs. While veterans
may benefit from the ability to receive care through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
healthcare system, there remain notable challenges and disparities for this population. Barriers
to medical treatment in the veteran population broadly include long wait times at VA facilities,
mental health illness and stress related to previous deployments, challenges reintegrating into
civilian life, and unmet basic needs such as housing and employment. (Misra-Hebert et al.
2015) Because of these barriers, veteran populations often suffer higher incidence of medical
comorbidities compared to civilian population. Assari (2014) Looking at vascular pathologies,
a large 2017 epidemiological study demonstrated that there is a higher incidence of PAD and
associated mortality among veterans, with an estimated 30% of veterans dying within 3.8 years
of a PAD diagnosis. (Willey et al. 2018) Additional studies have shown that demonstrated
that mental illness may compound vascular comorbidities within the veteran population, as
veterans suffering from comorbid depression face significantly higher risk of amputation and
death from PAD. (Arya et al. 2018) Ultimately, understanding the complex social determinants
and healthcare needs of veterans is essential for developing targeted interventions and support
systems to improve the health and well-being of this vulnerable population.

Teaching Case
Scenario
A 65 year old man is brought to the emergency room with altered mental status, fevers, and
severe pain, swelling, and erythema in his right foot. On exam, the foot is warm to the
touch and you observe a deep, ulcerating wound with surrounding necrotic tissue. His labs
are notable for an elevated white count and HbA1c of 10. His daughter, who is the patient’s
legal medical decision maker, is at the patient’s bedside and tells you that the patient was
laid off from work 6-months ago and since then has not been able to afford insulin to manage
his diabetes. You call your attending surgeon about the patient’s concerning findings and
recommend an emergency operation. Your attending sighs and says “I’ll never understand
what kind of person lets their disease get this bad.”

Patient History and Physical Examination of
the Arterial System
Loay S Kabbani, MD, MHSA, FACS and Cassius Iyad Ochoa Chaar, MD, MS, RPVI

Listen to your patient, [they are] telling you the diagnosis. - William Osler.
Specialized testing should always be guided by the initial clinical impressions.
Though the electronic medical record helps eliminate repetitive questions and tests, it tends
to divert attention from the importance of talking to and examining the patient. Interacting
with the patient and family during the history and physical is extremely important to build
rapport with the patients and their family.
For vascular patients passing the “eyeball test” is important before discussing complex procedures. This includes knowing the level of independent living.

Patient History of the Arterial System
For vascular specialists, a focused arterial history should include the arteries of the neck, torso,
and extremities. Many diseases are systemic. For example, atherosclerotic disease affects the
carotid arteries, heart, upper extremities, abdominal blood vessels, and lower extremities.
Patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm may have synchronous peripheral aneurysms.

34

Head and Neck History:
 The history should focus on the carotid artery disease—see ?@sec-carotidarterystenosis
for more detail—specifically, any history of stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), or
amaurosis fugax.
 Amaurosis fugax is described as a curtain or shade causing transient monocular blindness.
This is usually caused by emboli from carotid disease on the ipsilateral side but may be
caused by other embolic sources, migraine, or giant cell arteritis.
 Syncopal episodes are usually not vascular in nature. However, in patients with subclavian stenosis, syncope may be a manifestation of subclavian steal syndrome.
 History of radiation to neck, prior carotid interventions or prior surgery to the neck
should be elucidated and prior studies should be obtained.

Upper Extremity History:
 Evaluation of the upper extremities should focus on the timing (acute vs. chronic) and
degree of ischemia (claudication vs. chronic limb-threatening ischemia).
 Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a sudden occlusion of the blood supply with no time for
collateral vessels to develop. It is characterized by the 6 Ps. Pulselessness, pain, pallor,
paresthesia, poikilothermia (cold), and paralysis. The most common etiology of acute
limb ischemia is embolic. However, uncommon causes of ALI in the upper extremity
may include thrombosis of a subclavian–axillary aneurysm.
 Intermittent hand coldness associated with pain and numbness may refect Raynaud’s
syndrome (associated with cold exposure) or vasospam of small vessels due to conditions
like frostbite or scleroderma.
 Raynaud’s phenomenon presents as episodes of vasospasm in response to cold or stress.
During an attack, the patient describes the affected areas turning white, blue, and red
associated with feeling cold and numb. As the circulation improves and the affected
areas turn red, the patient may experience throbbing, tingling, and swelling.
 Episodes of ischemia to the digits may be persistent, severe and associated with underlying obliterative microangiopathy and manifest with pain and tissue loss (ulceration or
gangrene).
 Chronic ischemia of the upper extremity is uncommon and can manifest with arm claudication (exertional fatigue). The etiology is most commonly proximal obstruction due to
atherosclerotic disease in the subclavian artery. Uncommon causes can include Takayasu
arteritis and thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS).
 Exertion of the arm causing posterior cerebral circulation symptoms (diplopia,
dysarthria, dizziness, drop attacks, vertigo, syncope, and ataxia) may refect a subclavian steal syndrome caused by subclavian artery stenosis proximal to the vertebral
artery.

35

Abdomen Arterial History:
 A majority of vascular pathology in the abdomen can be attributed to aneurysmal disease
or atherosclerotic disease. Other etiologies of abdominal vascular diseases can include
compression syndromes, embolisms, or dissections.
 Aneurysmal disease in the abdomen is usually asymptomatic.
 Patients with known abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) who present with fank or back
pain should be presumed to have a ruptured aneurysm until proven otherwise.
 On the other hand, mesenteric atherosclerosis can present with a constellation of symptoms. The typical trifecta of symptoms is weight loss, sitophobia (fear of food), and
postprandial pain. Atherosclerosis of the renal arteries, known as renal artery stenosis,
may present as severe hypertension, especially in young adults.
 Aortoiliac occlusive disease may present with Leriche’s syndrome. Leriche’s syndrome
is defined as bilateral hip and buttock claudication, absent femoral pulses, and impotence.
 Vascular etiologies of acute abdominal pain include ruptured AAA aneurysm, which
presents as severe pain radiating to the back or acute mesenteric ischemia, which presents
as pain out of proportion to physical exam

Lower Extremities History:
 An evaluation of the lower extremities for peripheral artery disease should focus on
the timing (acute vs. chronic) and degree of ischemia (claudication vs. chronic limbthreatening ischemia).
 Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is the sudden occlusion of the blood supply to a peripheral
limb. It is typically characterized by the 6 Ps. Pulselessness, pain, pallor, paresthesia,
poikilothermia (cold), and paralysis.
 Claudication is defined as cramping pain in the leg induced by exercise and relieved by
rest. It occurs after a fixed and reproducible distance and resolves with rest. The pain
is described as discomfort, cramping, numbness, or tiredness in the legs. Claudication
most commonly occurs in the calf muscles, but it can also affect the feet, thighs, hips,
and buttocks. It is crucial to determine to what extent the patient’s claudication affects
their lifestyle during history taking.
 Table 1 lists various differential diagnosis of leg pain, which can help differentiate claudication from pseudoclaudication and other types of leg pain. Table 1 is also helpful in
differentiating between other types of leg pain, pseudoclaudication, and true claudication.
 Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is when a patient with PAD has rest
pain or tissue loss. CLTI manifests as rest pain or tissue loss. Rest pain is characterized
as pain in the dorsum of the foot and toes at rest (i.e., without exertion such as walking).
The pain may worsen with leg elevation and many patients wake up in the middle of the

36

due the pain. They often state the pain improves by dangling their affected limb over
the side of their bed, which leads to better blood fow to the foot thanks to gravity.
 Tissue loss is often present in the form of a nonhealing wound, ulcer, or gangrene anywhere along the toes, foot, or lower leg. It is imperative you determine how long the
tissue loss has been present and if it has been improving. Often, patients with CLTI have
multiple levels of arterial disease and are at a much higher risk of amputation compared
to patients with simple claudication.

Physical Exam of the Arterial System
The arterial system is extensive, and a proper vascular exam should include the entire arterial
system.
The exam starts with the nurse checking the vital signs and bilateral upper extremity blood
pressures. A difference of > 10 mmHg between the upper extremities may indicate significant
hemodynamic stenosis.
Ĺ Key Notes
Arterial Bruit: Normal arterial fow is laminar and therefore silent. However, when
blood fow becomes turbulent it can often be heard (bruit) or palpated (thrill). Although
murmur and bruit are synonymous, audible turbulence originating from the heart is called
a murmur. Outside of the heart, audible turbulence is referred to as a bruit. The presence
of a bruit does not necessarily indicate significant arterial stenosis.
Pulses are described as:






0 or absent
1+ or diminished
2+ or normal
3+ or prominent or aneurysmal.
4+ or bounding or aneurysmal.

In patients with weak pulses, the examiner must take care not to confuse the patient’s
pulse with involuntary muscle twitches or their own pulse.
When a pulse is not palpated, a Doppler probe is used to assess the blood fow. The
doppler signal can be triphasic, or biphasic, or monophasic.
Doppler Signals:
 Triphasic and biphasic doppler signals indicate good blood fow.

37

 Monophasic signal correlates with moderate to severe decrease in arterial blood
fow.
 In severe ischemia, a soft continuous venous signal may be all that is heard.
Listen to examples of Doppler signals here.
On Exam:
 Temperature changes may help demarcate the level of disease.
 Sensory loss may be present in acute ischemia, chronic limb threatening ischemia,
and chronic neuropathy.

Head and Neck Exam:
Inspection:
 Pulsatile masses in the neck are usually tortuous carotid arteries mistaken for carotid
aneurysms. Carotid aneurysms are usually near the carotid bifurcation, while tortuous
carotid arteries are usually at the base of the neck. Carotid body tumors are also at the
carotid bifurcation. Both carotid body tumors and aneurysms are not visible until they
are large.
 If the patient complains of amaurosis fugax (i.e., transient vision loss), fundoscopy may
reveal cholesterol plaques called Hollenhorst plaques. These are thought to originate
from the carotid plaque.
Palpation:
 The carotid pulse is palpated on the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
Carotid palpation is generally not performed routinely as it may cause a syncopal episode
in elderly patients with sensitive carotid bulbs.
 A robust temporal pulse anterior to the ear is a sign of a patent common and external
carotid artery sign.
 A large supraclavicular pulse may indicate an enlarged subclavian artery. Otherwise, the
subclavian artery is usually not palpable.
Auscultation:
 Auscultate the carotid arteries for bruits.

38

 Using the stethoscope bell, you can hear the S1, and S2 heart sounds in the carotid artery
in the mid-neck. A bruit heard in the neck is not normal. This could be transmitted
from the heart or could be from a kink or narrowing in the carotid artery. The carotid
bruit is loudest in the mid neck over the carotid bifurcation. A heart murmur is loudest
in the upper chest.
 The intensity of the bruit and pitch do not correlate with the severity of stenosis. A
tight stenosis may have low fow and thus a faint bruit.
 When a carotid bruit is heard, only 25% will have significant stenosis (75% or greater),
and 50% will not have any stenosis.

Upper Extremity Exam:
Inspection
 Pink fingertips with capillary refill times < 2 seconds are a reliable sign of adequate
perfusion. Ischemia in the extremities manifests as paleness with poor to no capillary
refill. Chronic ischemia manifests with muscle atrophy.
 Raynaud phenomenon is characterized by a sharply demarcated triphasic color change after exposure to cold or emotional stress. First, the capillaries contract after the stressor,
causing a characteristic white appearance. Then, as the capillaries open a little, deoxygenated blood re-perfuses sluggishly which leads to a hypoxic blue color of the distal
extremity. Finally, when the capillaries recover and hyper-dilate, the affected limb becomes red and hyperemic. Raynaud’s phenomena may occur idiopathically (Raynaud’s
Disease) or secondarily due to autoimmune disease. It is often provoked by emotional
distress or exposure to the cold.
Palpation
 Palpate the axillary artery in the upper arm in the groove between the biceps and triceps
muscle.
 Palpate the brachial artery in the antecubital fossa just medial to the biceps tendon.
 Palpate the radial artery on the wrist’s fexor surface just medial to the radial styloid.
 Palpate the ulnar artery on the wrist’s fexor surface just medial to the distal ulna; it
lies deeper than the radial artery and may not be palpable.
 Absent pulses should initiate a search for a cause such as proximal atherosclerotic stenosis
in older adults or autoimmune disease such as Takayasu’s in young females.
 Aneurysm of the subclavian artery and axillary artery (assessed above and below the
clavicle) are diﬀcult to palpate if small. Brachial artery aneurysms are usually pseudoaneurysms from trauma or arterial access. Ulnar artery aneurysm occurs from repetitive
trauma in proximity to the hamate bone and manifests as hypothenar hammer syndrome.

39

Auscultation
 Listen for a bruit in the supraclavicular fossa over the subclavian artery.
 When pulses are not palpable, a doppler is used to assess blood fow in the arteries.
 A blood pressure difference > 10 mmHg refects hemodynamically significant stenosis in
the innominate, subclavian, or axillary arteries. In these situations, the higher blood
pressure is refective of the patient’s actual blood pressure.

Chest and Abdominal Exam:
Inspection
 The aorta usually is typically not visible on the exam. However, a large aneurysm may
be seen pulsating between the xiphoid and umbilicus, especially in thin patients.
Palpation
 The aorta bifurcates at the level of the umbilicus. To palpate the aorta, press your
fingers on both sides of the midline between the umbilicus and the xiphoid. To help
relax the abdomen, ask the patient to bend their knees, fex their hips, and relax their
abdominal muscle. The goal is not only to feel the aortic pulse but also to estimate the
size of the aorta. In people without aortic aneurysms, a palpable aorta is often the size
of the patient’s thumb. A tender, enlarged, pulsatile abdominal mass may represent a
symptomatic aortic aneurysm or infammatory aneurysm.
 The sensitivity of palpation to detect an abdominal aortic aneurysm is low (29%) for small
(3.0- 4cm) aneurysms. Moreover, even large aneurysms > 5 cm may not be detected on
physical exam (sensitivity of 76%). False positives can be found in elderly patients
who have tortuous anterior placed aorta. It is important to mention that palpation
of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is safe and has never been reported to precipitate
aortic rupture. When an aortic aneurysm is identified, A complete peripheral arterial
examination should be performed looking for evidence of distal embolization, ischemia
or associated peripheral artery aneurysms (femoral, popliteal).
 The iliac arteries lie deep in the pelvis and are usually not palpable, even if aneurysmal.
Auscultation
 Cardiac auscultation is performed to assess rate and rhythm with special attention to
the presence of any arrhythmias, gallops, and murmurs.
 Bruits in the abdomen are associated with arterial stenosis. The origin of the bruit could
be renal, mesenteric, or aortoiliac.

40

Lower Extremity Exam:
Inspection
 Pallor, cyanosis, and poor capillary refill are signs of chronic limb ischemia. Muscle
atrophy, hair loss, and thick toenails may also be present.
 Dependent rubor and pallor with elevation indicate advanced peripheral occlusive
disease. Dependent rubor is hyperemic erythematous discoloration of the limb in a
dependent position (sitting or standing). That is, dependent rubor is due to maximally
dilated capillaries and the effects of gravity. However, the limb becomes pale once the
foot is elevated (the patient lies down). Dependent rubor is usually associated with rest
pain and edema. It is frequently misdiagnosed as cellulitis.
 Ulcers need to be identified as neuropathic ulcers or ischemic ulcers. Neuropathic ulcers
are at pressure points over the plantar aspect of the metatarsal head. Ischemic ulcers
are more often towards the tip of the toes.
 Livedo Reticularis: Violaceous mottling of the skin with a reticular pattern of the skin
of the arms and legs. The term “livedo racemosa” is used for cutaneous findings in
infammatory or thrombotic vascular disease patients.
 Acrocyanosis: is defined as bluish discoloration of the extremities due to high deoxygenated blood in the capillaries. It is a persistent disorder without episodic triphasic
color response.
 Microembolic disease can manifest as blue toe syndrome/trash foot.
 Dry skin is present in chronic limb ischemia because the sebaceous glands function poorly
without adequate blood fow.
 Edema is called “pitting” when the indentation persists after applying pressure to a
small area. Pitting edema is associated with systemic diseases like heart failure, chronic
kidney disease, hypoproteinemia, or local disease of the veins or lymphatic. Non-pitting
edema is observed when the indentation does not persist. It is associated with myxedema,
lipedema, and advanced lymphedema.
 Claudication: Patients with claudication may have no significant finding on inspection
apart from muscle atrophy or hair loss.
Auscultation
 Auscultate the femoral region for the presence of any bruits. Auscultation may also find
continuous bruits which are likely due to an arterio-venous fistula.
Palpation
 Femoral pulse: palpated under the inguinal ligament, two-finger breaths from the pubic
tubercle.

41

 Popliteal pulse: with the patient’s knee fexed, both hands are wrapped around the knee,
and the tips of the fingertips are pressed into the popliteal space (posteriorly). The pulse
is located slightly lateral to midline. A normal popliteal artery may not be palpable.
 Dorsalis Pedis: palpated in the dorsum of the foot between the first and second extensor
tendons. Located just lateral to the tendon of extensor hallucis longus. You can ask the
patient to extend their great toe to identify the tendon.Postier tibial: palpated b posterior
to the medial malleolus. It is easier to palpate with the foot passively dorsifexed.
 Peroneal artery: not palpable. However, it can be found with a doppler on the lateral
aspect of the ankle
 When a pulse is not palpated, a doppler is used to assess the blood fow. The doppler
signal can be triphasic, biphasic, or monophasic.
 Triphasic and biphasic doppler signals indicate good blood fow.
 Monophasic signals correlate with a moderate to severe decrease in arterial blood fow.
 In severe ischemia, a soft continuous venous signal may be all that is heard.
 Temperature changes may help demarcate the level of disease.
 Sensory loss may be present in acute ischemia and chronic neuropathy.

Carotid Artery Stenosis
Angela Kokkosis, MD, FACS and Michael Malinowski, MD, MEHP, FACS

Note
By the end of this chapter, students will:
 Review the foundational knowledge to appraise asymptomatic and symptomatic
carotid artery stenosis.
 Identify and describe risk factors, symptoms, and signs of carotid artery disease.
 Review and describe indications and contraindications for medical and surgical
management of carotid artery stenosis.
 Propose next best steps in patient work-up and treatment of carotid artery disease.
 Describe the evidence-based outcomes of surgical management of carotid artery
disease.
Key Facts
1. Stroke is the leading cause of disability nationally and 3rd leading cause of death
with a breakdown of 80% occlusive (ischemic) and 20% hemorrhagic.
2. Symptomatic carotid stenosis presents with only three symptoms including: stroke,
transient ischemic attack (TIA) and amaurosis fugax (transient retinal ischemia).
3. Risk factors include: age, smoking, CAD, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia
and genetic/family history.
4. Seminal studies include ACAS and NASCET. They define an 11% five-year risk of
stroke for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (>60%) and 24% two-year risk of
stroke for symptomatic disease (>70%), respectively.
5. The CREST landmark study associates carotid artery stenting with higher perioperative risk of stroke and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with higher risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in symptomatic patients.
6. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is indicated for recurrent stenosis after CEA, neck
immobility, high carotid bifurcation, contralateral occlusion, high risk open surgical
candidate due to cardiopulmonary comorbidity and neck radiation.

46

7. Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) is available for direct common
carotid delivery of stent while avoiding aortic arch manipulation and providing
embolic protection through fow reversal.
8. There is a marginal benefit for intervention for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis
patients with significant cardiopulmonary disease due to risks of associated perioperative events.

Pre/Post Questions
Case Based Questions
1. A 75-year-old male smoke presents with recent visual changes to his right eye that occurred yesterday. The patient reports a shading of his visual field that resulted in momentary monocular blindness followed by return to normal vision. He has a carotid duplex
showing >50% diameter reduction to his right internal carotid artery and >80% stenosis
to his left internal carotid artery. What treatment should be offered to his patient?
A. Emergent DC cardioversion to treat any underlying arrythmia.
B. Left carotid endarterectomy with shunt placement.
C. Left carotid TCAR.
D. Right carotid endarterectomy.

47

E. Placement on Apixaban and measurement of PF4 with medical management.
Answer
D. Right carotid endarterectomy
Discussion: The patient has evidence of amaurosis fugax with temporary monocular blindness as a sign of symptomatic right internal carotid artery disease. His left carotid artery
is in a high-grade range and therefore is lower risk of stroke than the contralateral symptomatic lesion. There should be no immediate surgical treatment of the asymptomatic
left carotid lesion. There is no evidence that the patient has an underlying arrythmia
that needs cardioversion and medical management with Apixaban and PF4 levels are
unrelated to this patient’s current pathology.
2. A 50-year-old female patient with >80% right internal carotid artery stenosis presents
to clinic for her first postoperative visit after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). She has
no interval neurologic events since her discharge, has a soft neck with a clean incision.
During your neurologic exam you notice an unintentional, subtle tongue deviation to the
side of surgery. What is the most likely facial nerve involved in this finding?
A. Vagus Nerve.
B. Hypoglossal Nerve.
C. Glossopharyngeal Nerve.
D. Long Thoracic Nerve.
E. Hering’s Nerve.
Answer
B. Hypoglossal Nerve
Discussion: This patient has evidence of hypoglossal nerve neuropraxia which can occur
as the result of injury or traction on the nerve during distal dissection of the internal
carotid artery. Although both glossopharyngeal nerve injury and vagal injuries can also
occur during CEA, the former causes oropharyngeal dysfunction with swallowing and
the latter causes vocal cord paralysis leading to a hoarse voice. The long thoracic nerve
is more related to thoracic outlet surgery and innervation of the serratus anterior. The
Nerve of Hering is related to carotid sinus innervation and is unrelated to this clinical
finding.
3. During the initial evaluation of a patient with high grade symptomatic carotid disease,
you notice that the patient has internal carotid plaque on that side this is above the
angle of the mandible at the 1st cervical vertebral body (C1). This appears to be too
high to access through open surgery. The patient has no know history of coronary artery

48

disease, has a preserved ejection fraction and good functional status. He has a lowdensity lipoprotein level (LDL) of 200 mg/dL. What is the best treatment option for this
individual?
A. Transfemoral carotid artery angioplasty with placement on ASA only.
B. Carotid artery enterectomy with shunt placement.
C. Daily ASA therapy without any type of statin or antihypertensive therapy.
D. Trancarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) surgery with dual antiplatelet therapy.
E. No treatment is indicated.
Answer
D. Transcarotid artery revascularization surgery with dual antiplatelet therapy.
Discussion: This patient has symptomatic carotid stenosis with an overall optimal coronary health. Because his lesion is high at C1 and not surgically accessible, they would
not qualify for a traditional carotid endarterectomy. Transfemoral carotid artery angioplasty is not indicated without stent placement, and daily ASA therapy without statin
treatment for an LDL of 200mg/dL does not qualify as optimal medical management.
Surgical treatment is indicated in this symptomatic patient since he has no significant
cardiopulmonary disease and TCAR is the only option listed that could accomplish this
outcome successfully.
4. A 60-year-old otherwise healthy woman, with no underlying comorbidities has a right
carotid artery bruit on physical examination. She is concerned that she is at risk for
stroke. She denies any episodes of vision changes, upper or lower extremity deficits, or
speech impairments. She currently takes 81mg of aspirin daily, along with a multivitamin.
What is the next step in management for this patient?
A. No further treatment necessary.
B. Carotid duplex.
C. CT angiogram head and neck.
D. Neurology evaluation.
E. Addition of statin therapy.
Answer
A. No further treatment necessary.
Discussion: This patient has an incidental finding of a carotid bruit on physical exam,

49

however she has no risk factors for carotid disease (such as smoking, hyperlipidemia,
smoking, family history, diabetes or hypertension). Additionally, she is neurologically
asymptomatic. Therefore, carotid duplex, CTA, neurology evaluation, and the addition
of statin therapy are not indicated. The prevalence of >75% carotid stenosis for those
with a carotid bruit has been found to be very low at 1.2%.
5. A 65-year-old man who is right-handed is undergoing evaluation for a coronary artery
bypass graft surgery (CABG). As part of his workup, a carotid duplex is performed
which demonstrates a chronic right carotid occlusion and a >80% stenosis of his left
carotid artery. He has no history of ocular or cerebrovascular events. He has hypercholesterolemia and well-controlled hypertension. What is the next best step for this
patient?
A. Proceed with the CABG as planned and continue medical therapy with aspirin and
statin.
B. Left carotid endarterectomy before the CABG.
C. Place the patient on dual antiplatelet therapy, in addition to statin therapy.
D. Left TCAR (transcarotid stent) after the CABG.
E. Place the patient on anticoagulation.
Answer
B. Left carotid endarterectomy before CABG.
Discussion: It is standard of care to assess the carotid arteries prior to performing
a CABG, with the goal of minimizing the risk of perioperative stroke. This patient
has asymptomatic bilateral severe carotid disease (right occlusion and left >80% stenosis). Therefore, to reduce the risk of perioperative stroke, current guidelines recommend
carotid revascularization prior or concomitant with the CABG. The patient does carry
one high risk criterion for TCAR (coronary disease requiring revascularization), however
this should not be performed after the CABG. Dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated in
the event this patient undergoes carotid stenting, however medical management should
not be the only management of his carotid disease. Lastly, anticoagulation has no role
in atherosclerotic disease, such as carotid disease.
6. A 55-year-old woman has a past medical history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary stenting in 2019, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous smoking history
of 60 pack-years. Her cardiologist sends her for a carotid duplex which demonstrates a
50-69% carotid stenosis on the left side, and mild atherosclerosis on the right side. She
denies any prior signs or symptoms of stroke or transient ischemic attack. How should
this patient’s carotid disease be managed?

50

A. Left carotid endarterectomy, along with aspirin/statin therapy.
B. Left transfemoral carotid stent, along with dual antiplatelet/statin therapy.
C. Aspirin and statin therapy only, and routine surveillance carotid duplexes.
D. Aspirin, statin therapy, blood pressure management, and routine surveillance carotid
duplexes.
E. No further management is indicated.
Answer
D. Aspirin, statin therapy, blood pressure management, and routine surveillance carotid duplexes.
Discussion: This patient has asymptomatic 50-69% left carotid stenosis with the associated risk factors of vascular disease which include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and
smoking history. Medical therapy needs to be employed to reduce these factors, thus a
single antiplatelet, statin, and blood pressure medication are indicated. Fortunately, the
patient is not a current smoker, however if she was, then smoking cessation counseling
would be added to her treatment plan. Carotid revascularization is indicated only for
asymptomatic carotid stenosis that is >70% based on current guidelines.

Operative Footage Questions
These questions are associated with the carotid endarterectomy (CEA) footage (short version) found at the bottom of the chapter.
1. What is the first muscle layer encountered in a CEA (i.e. the first muscle deep to skin)?
A. Sternocleidomastoid
B. Digastric
C. Platysma
D. Scalene
Answer
C. Platysma
Discussion: The platysma is the most superficial muscle in the neck. It covers most of
the anterior and lateral aspect of the neck. It is the first muscle layer encountered in
the neck during a CEA. It will be bisected and repaired upon neck closure. While the
sternocleidomastoid is superficial, it is deep to the platysma. The sternocleidomastoid
is an important landmark as it forms the anterolateral boundary of the carotid triangle.

51

You will dissect along its medial border and retract it laterally in order to access the
carotid sheath.The digastric muscle is a small, “two-bellied” muscle located under the
mandible. The posterior belly forms the superior border of the carotid triangle. It is often
visualized in patients with high carotid bifurcations.The scalene muscles are deep to the
sternocleidomastoid muscles and lateral to the cervical spine. They are not manipulated
in a CEA.
2. What structure is not found in the carotid sheath?
A. Internal jugular vein
B. External jugular vein
C. Common carotid artery
D. Vagus nerve
Answer
B. External jugular vein
Discussion: The external jugular vein is not in the carotid sheath. It runs superficial to
and obliquely across the sternocleidomastoid before passing to the posterior border of
the sternocleidomastoid as it descends deep into the neck. The carotid sheath contains
the common carotid artery anteromedially, the internal jugular vein anterolaterally, and
the vagus nerve posteriorly.
3. In what order do you unclamp the carotid vessels at the end of a carotid endarterectomy?
A. External carotid artery → common carotid artery → internal carotid artery
B. Common carotid artery → internal carotid artery → external carotid artery
C. Internal carotid artery → external carotid artery → common carotid artery
D. Internal carotid artery → common carotid artery → external carotid artery
Answer
A. External carotid artery → common carotid artery → internal carotid
artery
Discussion: In conventional CEA, the internal carotid artery (ICA), the common carotid
artery (CCA), and the external carotid artery (ECA) are clamped in that order such that
any atherosclerotic debris loosened during vessel manipulation and/or clamping embolizes
into the ECA where it could cause extracranial ischemia rather than the ICA where it
could cause intracranial ischemia (i.e. ischemic stroke). A useful mnemonic to remember

52

the clamping order is ICE for ICA, CCA, and ECA. The order when unclamping is the
opposite, ECI. The rational is similar. By unclamping the ECA first, remaining debris
or debris loosened during removal of the clamps will fow up the ECA rather than the
ICA. By unclamping the CCA second, and dislodged debris will fow down the open ECA
rather than the ICA. The ICA is unclamped last. Options A and B are dangerous as they
do not minimize the risk of embolus fowing into the ICA. Option C is simply incorrect.

Introduction
Hemispheric stroke related to carotid artery stenosis is a leading cause of both disability and
death in the United States. Underlying etiologies for stroke include occlusive or hemorrhagic
events with roughly 80% being related to occlusive pathology through embolus or in-situ
thrombosis, the remaining 20% attributable to hemorrhage. Roughly 15% of stroke victims
have a transient ischemic attack (TIA) that fully resolved prior to a later stroke event. Risk
factors for carotid plaque formation are related to age, smoking, coronary artery disease,
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and family history of stroke. Due to carotid bulb
anatomy, the most common area of plaque formation is within the proximal internal carotid
artery. As plaque stenosis increases over time, the systolic velocity increases to maintain
fow volumes which intensifies shear stress. This shear stress increases likelihood of plaque
rupture, platelet aggregation and thromboembolization. There are multiple seminal studies
that describe cohort comparisons of asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid artery stenosis
with outcomes related to optimal medical management alone or as adjunct to surgical repair.
Symptomatic carotid stenosis is described as carotid stenosis >50% with unilateral stroke, TIA
or amaurosis fugax on the side of carotid disease. Amaurosis fugax is historically described
as shade coming down across one eye on the side of stenosis to produce partial or complete,
painless monocular visual loss related to transient retinal ischemia. Amaurosis fugax may be
bilateral in the case of bilateral, symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.

Etiology
Atherosclerosis is the most common cause for the development of carotid artery disease. This
process is defined by deposition of lipid-laden plaque at the carotid bifurcation, and potentially
across a larger territory of the common carotid, external carotid, and internal carotid arteries.
This plaque may contain varying degrees of calcification and/or thrombus. The mechanisms

53

by which atherosclerosis at the carotid bifurcation may lead to stroke or TIA are: occlusion
(cessation of blood fow to the internal carotid artery) or embolization (plaque debris break
off and travel through the internal carotid artery to the brain). There are various risk factors
which may contribute to the degree of atherosclerosis and its progression. These include
history of cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension,
advanced age, and family history of carotid disease or stroke.

Diagnostics and Imaging
Three primary imaging modalities are used to evaluate carotid artery stenosis with the lowest
cost option being color fow duplex ultrasound (DSA) that allows a physician to determine
peak systolic and end diastolic velocities throughout the carotid bifurcation. Based on the
internally validated vascular laboratory criteria of the institution, these velocities can be correlated to ranges of degree of stenosis, with high grade stenosis defined as >70-80%. Since
the modality is based primarily on velocity range, it cannot give exact stenosis such as 66%.
The modality can also provide adjunct information about the blood fow waveforms in each
arterial segment, as well as whether that fow is laminar or turbulent with utilization of color
fow imaging. Limitations of this imaging include technician skill, inability to obtain optimal
angle of Doppler interrogation for velocity determination, shadowing from heavily calcified
lesions, poor visualization due to patient habitus and tortuosity.
Axial imaging options include both computed tomography angiogram (CTA) and magnetic
resonance angiogram (MRA). Both of these options require some form of intra-arterial contrast,
either iodinated contrast or gadolinium, respectively. However, they offer a fuller perspective
of relevant anatomy and a more precise determination of stenosis within the limitations of the
modality, with MRA often overestimating the degree of stenosis due to intrinsic properties of
MRA imaging acquisition. Both CTA and MRA, although superior to DSA in determination
of exact degree of plaque stenosis and arterial anatomy, sacrifice the physiologic information
offered through DSA that speak to fow patterns, fow direction and turbulence. Axial imaging
of CTA and MRA can define patency but do not speak to the dynamic nature of blood fow
or directionality of fow.
Definitive determination of fow and directionality can be augmented to a carotid artery stenosis workup by diagnostic angiography. This requires femoral artery access and includes contrast
administration, as well as a small risk of periprocedural embolization. However, it offers additional physiologic evaluation that might not be present in DSA and that is inherently lacking
in CTA and MRA studies.

54

Asymptomatic Carotid Atery Stenosis Screening
The 2021 SVS clinical practice guidelines outline the following recommendations. In asymptomatic patients who qualify for carotid artery stenosis screening, duplex ultrasound is the
recommended choice over CTA, MRA, or other imaging modalities.
Routine screening is not recommended for clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis
for individuals without significant risk factors for carotid disease.
Screening is recommended for clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis in individuals with significant risk factors** for carotid disease. High-risk groups include:
 Patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD)
 Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG)
 Patients aged >= 55 years with at least two traditional atherosclerotic risk factors (hyperlipidemia, hypertension, etc.)
 Patients aged >= 55 years and active cigarette smoking
 Patients with diabetes, hypertension, or coronary artery disease (CAD)
 Patients with clinically occult cerebral infarction noted on brain imaging studies.
The presence of a carotid bruit increases the likelihood of detecting significant stenosis. Asymptomatic patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) or previous radiotherapy to the
neck who do not meet the criteria of any of the high-risk groups above do not require screening.
It has been shown that the prevalence of carotid stenosis increases proportionally with the
number of risk factors present.

Treatment
Carotid Artery Endarterectomy (CEA)
This procedure has been performed since the 1950s, either by plaque endarterectomy and
patch angioplasty or primary arterial repair. To prevent arterial restenosis, patch angioplasty
has become the standard of arterial closure after plaque removal. The procedure can involve
cerebral monitoring including electroencephalography (EEG), transcranial Doppler (TCD) and
stump pressure monitoring or be performed awake to directly monitor patient motor response.
Endarterectomy and patch repair can be performed under a “clamp and sew” mentality or with
an arterial shunt to maintain cerebral perfusion. Risks include cardiopulmonary risk of acute
myocardial ischemia, <3% perioperative risk of neurologic event, neck hematoma or cranial
nerve injury of roughly 5-10% affecting the vagus, marginal mandibular, recurrent laryngeal
or hypoglossal nerves.

55

Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS)
Transfemoral Carotid Artery Stenting (TFCAS) with Embolic Protection
Transfemoral stenting requires some type of protection from embolization including a distal internal carotid artery retrievable filter or fow arrest procedure to prevent cerebral embolization
during stent placement with or without angioplasty.
Transcarotid Artery Revascularization (TCAR)
Treatment of a carotid stenosis that avoids aortic arch manipulation involving direct common
carotid artery exposure and sheath placement to allow for transcarotid stent delivery to the
internal carotid artery. The common carotid artery sheath is connected to a femoral vein
sheath so that the natural arterial pressure gradient reverses fow across the distal internal
carotid artery driving blood and possible embolus into the arterial tubing circuit and across a
filter before it reenters the venous circulation. As FDA approval for the device was delivered
in 2016, the technology is less than 10 years old without robust long-term follow up data.
This technique offers a lower perioperative stroke risk than transfemoral stenting, for multiple
reasons including lack of transaortic arch manipulation and great vessel cannulation which can
result in embolus prior to placement of an internal carotid artery embolic protection device.

Optimal Medical Management
Understandably, optimal medical management requires full risk evaluation of the individual
patient in question including other comorbidities, drug allergies, compliance, etc. We have
listed a few broad recommendations to follow that offer general guidance surrounding the
dynamic target of optimal medical management for arterial disease.
Antiplatelet Therapy
 ASA offers a 22% risk reduction in major vascular events with no difference in protection
based on dosage (81 versus 325 mg).
 Clopidogrel can be used as an adjunct or alternative to ASA, but the added benefit from
dual antiplatelet combination in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis is unproven.
Anticoagulants
 Only useful for prevention of cardioembolic strokes due to arrhythmia or prosthetic valve.

56

Hypertension Treatment
 Recommended blood pressure range of <130/80 with individual antihypertensive regimen
based on other comorbidities and patient risk factors.
Diabetic Control
 In accordance with best practice for diabetes management, the patient’s hemoglobin A1c
should be <7.0
Smoking Cessation
 Treatments offered include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline or bupropion
as first line agents.
Hyperlipidemia Management
 Regimen goals of LDL <100mg/dl, or <70mg/dl depending on risk profile.

Outcomes and Surveillance
Asymptomatic carotid stenosis
 The historically touted Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) demonstrated that patients with >60% carotid stenosis who underwent CEA benefited significantly from stroke risk reduction at 5 years (5.1% for CEA vs. 11% for optimal medical
therapy consisting of aspirin alone).
 More recent studies suggest that with the current optimal medical management, which
consists of antiplatelet medication and statin therapy, 5-year stroke risk is highest in
patients with >70% carotid stenosis, and therefore this patient population would benefit
from carotid endarterectomy.
 Patients who are deemed high risk, either due to an anatomic (such as surgically inaccessible bifurcation or restenosis after previous CEA) or physiologic findings (congestive
heart failure, severe coronary artery disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease),
may be considered for TCAR given the equivocal results of perioperative stroke or death
at 1.3%, as compared to CEA.

57

 Asymptomatic patients with significant risk factors found to have moderate stenoses
(50%-79%) should be followed every 6-months to detect disease progression. High risk
patients with <50% stenosis can be followed-up annually.

Symptomatic carotid stenosis
 Patients who have >50% carotid stenosis and have developed symptoms of TIA or stroke
were found to benefit from CEA in the pivotal North American Symptomatic Carotid
Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) because of the significant 2-year stroke risk reduction
as compared to optimal medical management (15.7% vs. 22.2%.). An even greater stroke
risk reduction was seen in patients with >70% carotid stenosis (9% CEA vs. 26% medical
management).
 Current management of patients with symptomatic >50% carotid stenosis who are
low/standard risk is carotid endarterectomy over transfemoral carotid stenting (TFCAS),
as there are no studies to date which have shown benefit of TFCAS.
 Patients who are deemed high risk, as defined above, may be considered for TCAR over
TFCAS due to the significantly lower incidence of in-hospital stroke and death (1.6%
vs. 3.1%).
 Post-operative surveillance (by duplex ultrasound) after open (CEA) or endovascular
(TF-CAS) repair of the carotid artery is strongly recommended by the SVS to monitor
for signs of restenosis in the repaired artery or atherosclerotic disease progression in the
unoperated, contralateral artery. Duplex ultrasound testing is recommended within 30
days of the procedure, then every 6 months for 2 years, then annually.
 Restenosis <50% warrants the regular surveillance protocol; 50-99% warrants closer
follow-up, confirmation with a CTA, and possible angiographic evaluation; 100% restenosis warrants surveillance and medical treatment of the contralateral carotid artery.
 It should be noted, there is some debate as to the economic and medical value of continuing post-operative duplex ultrasound surveillance after successful CEA with patch
closure when the immediate post-operative duplex was normal or showed minimal disease.

Teaching Case
Scenario

58

his right eye with resolution about a minute later with complete return of normal vision at
that point. He denies any other symptoms during the event or since, such as motor or sensory
deficits, speech, etc. He did not think much of the event but presented after his wife told him
to see someone about the event.

Aortic Disorders

63

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)
Erin K. Greenleaf, MD, MS, Jonathan Bath, MD, Dawn M. Coleman, MD, FACS and Ezra
Schwartz, MD,CM, MS.

Note
By the end of this chapter, students will:
 Review abdominal aortic anatomy and aneurysm pathophysiology.
 Recognize history, physical exam, and radiologic findings typical of patients presenting with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
 Identify indications for intervention on abdominal aortic aneurysms and the
evidence-based foundation for these recommendations.
 Describe the basic procedural steps of both an endovascular and an open surgical
approach for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
 Delineate appropriate surveillance intervals for imaging an abdominal aortic
aneurysm, both before and after intervention.
Key Facts
1. Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur in 2-8% of the population in Western countries,
with a slightly higher prevalence among males relative to females.
2. The average size of an abdominal aorta is approximately 2cm; hence, an aneurysm
is diagnosed when the diameter of the aorta in this segment reaches 3cm (i.e. 1.5x
normal diameter).
3. Risk factors for an abdominal aortic aneurysm growth include age, male sex, white
race, smoking, atherosclerosis, family history of arterial aneurysms, and personal
history of arterial aneurysms.
4. According to vascular surgery guidelines, elective repair of a fusiform abdominal
aortic aneurysm is recommended once the aneurysm has reached 5.5cm diameter in males and 5 cm diameter in females, measured from outer wall to outer
wall. Circumstances in which repair is indicated for smaller aneurysms include
those associated with symptoms and/or rupture, saccular morphology, rapid ex-

64

pansion, or those in females (as mentioned above), immunosuppressed patients
(i.e. chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or solid organ transplantation) and patients
with aortopathies (e.g. Marfan Syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, etc.).
5. Nearly 80% of abdominal aortic aneurysms are currently repaired via an endovascular approach, with an open surgical approach generally reserved for patients in
which a stent graft would perform poorly.
6. Outcomes following endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair have improved
over time, as experience has accrued with endovascular technique. This pattern of
progressive improvement has not similarly been seen for open surgical repair.
7. Surveillance regimens for patients with unrepaired abdominal aortic aneurysms
suggest imaging via ultrasound or computerized tomography (CT) scan every three
years if the aneurysm is 3.0-3.9cm diameter, every year if the aneurysm is 4.0-4.9cm,
and every six months if the aneurysm is 5.0-5.4cm.

3. A 68-year-old male with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, tobacco abuse, obesity,
and gout is found to have a 5.9cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with a 21mm
neck, patent common femoral arteries, but highly calcified/nearly occluded bilateral iliac
arteries. Upon discussing repair with him in your surgery clinic, what would you advise
the patient about his repair?
A. He should undergo endovascular repair because there is at least 20mm of neck below the
lowest renal artery before the aneurysm begins.
B. He should undergo endovascular repair with percutaneous access because his common
femoral arteries are widely patent.
C. He should undergo endovascular repair because this will minimize his inpatient stay while
maximizing the primary patency of the stent graft.

66

A. Type Ia endoleak; blood is filling the sac from the proximal extent of the stent graft.
B. Type III endoleak; blood is filling the sac from the middle and can appear to be coming
from a lumbar artery.
C. Type Ib endoleak; blood is filling the sac retrograde from the iliac arteries and so is only
seen with a late aortogram view.
D. Type II endoleak; fow from a lumbar artery would cause a late blush and can be followed
conservatively provided that the sac does not continue to expand.
E. No endoleak.

Introduction
The aorta is invariably the largest arterial conduit in the body, serving as the channel through
which blood from the heart travels to every other body part. The wall of the aorta is comprised
of three layers, which include the intima, media and adventitia. Its typical course begins at
the distal side of the aortic valve and terminates at the aortic bifurcation, where it splits into

68

the two common iliac arteries. The thoracic aortic segment provides blood fow to the great
vessels of the aortic arch, ensuring perfusion to the head and bilateral upper extremities via the
innominate artery, the left carotid artery, and the left subclavian artery (in that order). The
abdominal segment is a retroperitoneal structure that enters the abdominal cavity through
the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm, at the level of T12. The branches of the abdominal aorta
include, in descending order, the two inferior phrenic arteries, the celiac axis or trunk, the
superior mesenteric artery (SMA), the renal arteries, the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA),
and ultimately, the bilateral common iliac arteries. The branches of both the thoracic and
abdominal aorta provide blood fow to areas of critically vital viscera.

Figure 1: Anatomically normal aorta with main and visceral branches.
While the aorta serves a critical role for the rest of the body, it can be the site of significant
pathology. Aneurysms, which are common pathology in both the thoracic and abdominal aorta,
are defined by an increase in arterial diameter to 1.5 times the normal diameter of the vessel. As

69

the diameter of the aortic aneurysm increases, the risk of rupture increases in direct proportion.
For example, a patient with a 4cm abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has an approximate 1year rupture risk of 1%; a patient with a 5.5cm aneurysm has up to a 10% 1-year rupture risk.
With the widespread use of cross-sectional imaging, many aortic aneurysms are discovered
incidentally. Others are found on screening exams. The US Preventative Services Task Force
recommends that men aged 65 to 75 years of age who have ever smoked tobacco undergo an
abdominal ultrasound to screen for aneurysmal disease. Aortic aneurysms may also present
symptomatically, with chest, abdominal and/or back pain and occasionally a palpable pulsatile
abdominal mass, which is widely believed to represent an increasingly unstable aneurysm.

Etiology
Certain risk factors, some modifiable and others non-modifiable (a.k.a. innate), predispose
individuals to the development of aortic aneurysms. These include age, male gender, family
history of aneurysms or aortopathies, and comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral vascular disease. Interestingly, female sex, African American race, and
a history of diabetes have been found to be protective against the development and rupture of
aortic aneurysms. A personal history of Marfan’s syndrome, Loeys Dietz syndrome, or Ehlers
Danlos Type IV (a.k.a. vascular Ehlers-Danlos or vEDS) is associated with a particularly
elevated risk of aneurysmal degeneration. Medical providers should counsel and assist their
patients to mitigate all potentially modifiable risk factors.

Diagnostics and Imaging
When evaluating a patient with a suspected aortic aneurysm, a thorough history, physical
examination, and imaging will help to narrow the differential diagnosis. Most often, patients
present without symptoms; however, if symptomatic, typical complaints include chest, abdominal or back pain. Physical exam findings may not be overt but vital signs may provide a first
clue in a symptomatic patient as heart rate and blood pressure might deviate from normal
ranges. Patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) often have no other easily identifiable
physical exam findings aside from vital sign derangements in those with symptomatic or ruptured aneurysms. In thin patients with suspected AAA, the abdominal exam may demonstrate
a pulsatile mass at or adjacent to the midline.

70

Figure 2: Aneurysm Topography
Although the history and physical exam are indispensable to patient evaluation, the diagnosis
of an aneurysm is usually secured with imaging. The mainstay of imaging is computed tomography (CT), while ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and angiography are
useful modalities in non-urgent or non-emergent settings. The benefits of CT, particularly
the richness of anatomic data obtained, must be weighed against the potential risks related
to contrast administration and exposure to radiation. Since the 2019 statement from the U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force regarding one-time screening with ultrasonography in men
aged 65 to 75 years who have ever smoked, the use of ultrasound has a more prominent role
in AAA screening. Equipped with history, exam, and imaging data, the diagnosis of an aortic
aneurysm can usually be made.
When looking at an imaging study, abdominal aortic aneurysms are labeled in regard to their
location relative to the renal arteries:
 Aortic aneurysms are termed “suprarenal” when their most proximal extent is above
the level of the renal arteries. Suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms typically involve
visceral branches of the aorta as well (i.e. the SMA or celiac trunk) and thus may also
be classified as a Crawford type IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA)
 Aneurysms are labeled “pararenal” when the proximal extent of the aneurysm is at the
level of the renal arteries and includes the origins of the renal arteries.

71

 Abdominal aortic aneurysms are termed “juxtarenal” when their most proximal extent
is immediately below the take-off of the renal arteries.
 Lastly, aneurysms are labeled “infrarenal” when they begin below the renal arteries,
often with a neck of non-dilated aorta between the lowest renal artery and the top of
the aneurysm. As one might expect, the location of the aneurysm has implications for
treatment options.

Ď Tip
Please see Figure 2 of this American Heart Association publication depicting the anatomic
classifications of AAAs.

Treatment
Once a diagnosis has been obtained, considerations for management follow. Similar to a
thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), indications for repair are refective of risk for rupture. The
aim is to intervene when the rupture risk exceeds the risks posed by surgery. Intervention

72

is considered when an aneurysm reaches the size threshold of 5.5cm in males and 5cm in
females or if the growth rate exceeds 5 mm in 6 months. Again, this threshold is modified
in patients with a strong family history of aneurysmal disease or collagen vascular disorder,
or when patients present symptomatically or with a ruptured aorta. The topography of the
aneurysm must also be considered as a saccular aneurysm, an isolated pouch off the sidewall
of the aorta, presents a much greater risk of rupture and should be fixed when identified.
On first evaluation, patients with AAAs should be medically optimized to minimize their
perioperative risk of morbidity and mortality. Multiple factors must be considered when
deciding between an open surgical approach and an endovascular one. While the prevalence of
endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) has exponentially increased in the past two decades relative
to open surgical repair (OSR), each aneurysm poses a unique set of potential constraints that
suggest a preference for one type of repair over another.
Please see the Section section and watch the included videos.

Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR)
Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is a novel approach to AAA treatment that has gained
widespread popularity since its first successful use by Dr. Juan Parodi and Dr. Julio Palmaz
in 1991. EVAR necessitates cross-sectional imaging to measure the AAA dimensions and
determine the appropriate size of an aortic stent graft. Stent grafts are straight or bifurcated
tubes with a wire framework covered by non-porous fabric. Simply, it is a tube that can be
deployed from inside a vessel.
EVAR Procedural Steps
A step-by-step guide of a typical, uncomplicated EVAR for an infrarenal AAA is listed below.
Please see the Section section to a video guide of a typical EVAR.
1. Bilateral femoral access via percutaneous or open surgical exposure (a.k.a. “femoral
cut-downs”)
2. Heparinization to achieve an activated clotting time (ACT) greater than 250 seconds.
3. Placement of stiff wires into the abdominal aorta and upsizing of sheaths into the access
vessels.
4. Aortogram to visualize renal arteries and deployment of the endograft main body under
the origins of the renal arteries.
5. Cannulation of contralateral limb gate using a wire and catheter with subsequent confirmation that both the wire and catheter are within the main body.


6. Aortoiliac angiogram to measure the distance from the contralateral gate to the contralateral hypogastric (i.e. internal iliac) artery.
7. Deployment of contralateral limb with the distal landing site just proximal to the hypogastric artery.
8. Partial deployment of the ipsilateral limb.
9. Aortoiliac angiogram to measure the distance from the ipsilateral gate of the main body
to the ipsilateral hypogastric artery.
10. Deployment of the remainder of the ipsilateral limb.
11. Ballooning of the proximal and distal landing zones, and areas of stent overlap.
12. Remove wires and sheaths and close arteriotomies (often with closure devices).
13. Reverse heparin with protamine.
14. Apply pressure to surgical sites and monitor for hematoma formation.
EVAR Considerations and Planning
The need for imaging can be a limiting factor such as when patients with a ruptured aneurysm
are too hemodynamically unstable to stop at the CT scanner prior to repair or when a patient’s
kidney function is too impaired to tolerate a large contrast bolus.
If the situation is amenable to getting a CT angiogram to measure anatomic dimensions, several
components of the aneurysm anatomy should be assessed to determine anatomic suitability for
EVAR. These include the length, width, angulation of the aneurysm, and presence of disease
at the aneurysm neck (i.e. the aortic segment between the lowest renal artery and the proximal
extent of the aortic dilatation).
Ď Tip
 See page 71 of the Gore Vascular/Endovascular Surgery Combat Manual in the additional resources (?@sec-additionalresources) for a high-yield EVAR planning
and sizing considerations chart.
 Video Tutorial: Endovascular Aortic Repair Preoperative Sizing with Dr. Sharif
Ellozy. This is above the level of medical students, but for those who are interested,
watch it here.
The access vessels, including the bilateral iliac and femoral arteries, must be healthy enough to
allow sheaths, wires and catheters to pass through them. Calcification due to atherosclerosis
can make arterial access diﬀcult, and if vessels are so diseased as to be completely occluded,
wires and devices may not be able to travel past the occlusion. Additionally, the iliac arteries must be within the appropriate diameter and length dimensions to accommodate the

chosen stent graft. Lastly, certain anatomic anomalies such as a horseshoe kidney must be
evaluated to ensure the appropriateness of EVAR for repair. With recent innovations in endovascular devices and intra-operative imaging, many factors that were once contraindications
to EVAR have now become considerations when planning for EVAR. This is to say, as technology advances, EVAR is increasingly possible and safe for patients with diﬀcult anatomy
and co-morbidities.
EVAR Complications
Although a more recent development relative to open surgical repair (OSR), EVAR is not
without risk of complications. EVAR may be complicated by injury to access vessels such as
femoral occlusion or iliac avulsion (aka, “iliac-on-a-stick”), wire trauma from the relatively
stiff wires that are used to deliver the stent graft, rupture of the aneurysm, and endoleak.
Endoleak is the term used to describe ongoing blood fow in the aneurysm sac after stent graft
placement (e.g. from lumbar arteries or the inferior mesenteric artery, inadequate proximal or
distal endograft seal, a defect in the endograft, etc.). There are various types of endoleak and
each has its own management approach.
Endoleaks are classified as follows:
 Type Ia: caused by an improper proximal endograft seal (i.e. the top of the graft is not
well opposed to the abdominal aorta and blood can fow around it into the aneurysm
sac).
 Type Ib: caused by an improper distal endograft seal (i.e. the distal iliac limb is not
well opposed to the iliac artery and blood can fow retrograde into the aneurysm sac).
 Type II: caused by retrograde blood fow into the aneurysm sac from aortic side branches
such as lumbar arteries or the IMA. This is the most common type and does not require
intervention provided a stable aneurysm sac size is observed on follow-up. If the sac continues to expand, the feeding vessels may need to be occluded via embolization (e.g. coil
embolization).
 Type III: caused by a defect in the endograft such as a fabric tear, or disconnection of
the contralateral iliac limb from the main body of the graft.
 Type IV: caused by graft wall porosity. To explain graft wall porosity, imagine filling
up a pillowcase with water. Even if the pillowcase has the tightest of weaves, eventually,
water will leak through the pillowcase.
 Type V: increase in aneurysm size with no identifiable cause.

Ď Tip
Please click here to open an article by Dr. Tamer W. Kassem with a simple image
depicting the endoleak classifications.
Additionally, one should monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome after repair of AAA
rupture, as much of the large volume resuscitation can leak from the intravascular compartment into the interstitium of the abdominal tissues causing distention. In the event of rupture,
the retroperitoneal hematoma can cause a mass effect and increase of abdominal pressures.
Lastly, a well-known complication of EVAR is ischemic colitis, although it is only encountered
in less than 3% of endovascular aortic repairs. This occurs when the colon becomes ischemic
secondary to vascular hypoperfusion caused by a variety of quoted sources including atheroembolization and systemic hypotension. Albeit rare, ischemic colitis has a significant associated
mortality risk and should be addressed promptly with bowel rest, antibiotic coverage, a fexible sigmoidoscopy, and potentially further intervention, if warranted. This complication is not
limited to EVAR and has been identified postoperatively with the same incidence in OSR.

Open Surgical Repair (OSR)
Open surgical repair (OSR) remains the traditional means of repairing AAA and is still the
most appropriate modality when EVAR is not feasible for anatomic reasons. In the elective
setting, the ideal patient is physiologically fit enough for OSR as it is a procedure with the
potential for significant morbidity and a lengthy recovery.
OSR Considerations and Planning
OSR can be conducted via a transperitoneal or a retroperitoneal exposure. Other decision
points for open repair include the following:
 Location of the proximal clamp: A clamp must be placed on the aorta in a location
free of significant disease, with enough clearance below it to allow space for suturing the
proximal anastomosis.
 Configuration of the proximal anastomosis: Anastomoses performed for aneurysmal disease are sewn in an end-to-end fashion, whereas aortas being reconstructed for occlusive
disease can be performed either end-to-end or end-to-side.
 Location of the distal anastomosis: the end of the graft can be sewn to either the distal
aorta, iliac arteries, or femoral arteries depending on the extent of the native vessel that
needs to be excluded and the distal location where the vessel is healthy enough to clamp
and receive sutures (e.g. is not heavily calcified).

78

 Management of the inferior mesenteric artery when an end-to-end anastomosis is created:
The IMA can be ligated If collateral fow is adequate or reimplanted into the graft if
collateral fow is inadequate.
 Management of aberrant intraperitoneal anatomy and pathology: Examples include adhesions or scarred tissue due to previous abdominal surgery, accessory renal arteries,
horseshoe kidney, history of kidney transplant, and previous aortic replacement, among
many other possibilities.
Depending on the urgency of repair, many of these considerations might only be entertained
intraoperatively.

Open Aortic Repair (OAR)
with suprarenal clamp.
OSR Complications
Complications related to OSR differ from those of EVAR, owing greatly to the open abdominal
exposure and the lack of intraluminal wire manipulation. Just as with most other laparotomies
or open retroperitoneal dissections, incisional pain can be significant and cause atelectasis
or other respiratory compromise. Additionally, ileus and wound infections can impair the
return of proper bowel function. Similar to EVAR, ischemic colitis can manifest after OSR,
particularly in the setting of rupture.

79

Outcomes
Much experience has been gained since the first EVAR in 1990 and ample research has been
dedicated to the comparison of EVAR to OSR. Multiple trials have demonstrated an early
survival advantage for EVAR over OSR that tends to diminish over time. Certainly, the
perioperative period for EVAR is notable for reduced morbidity and mortality relative to OSR
with length of hospital stay significantly longer in those undergoing OSR. However, this early
benefit is often balanced by a necessity for life-long follow-up including imaging at regular
intervals and a tendency for re-interventions during the surveillance period (e.g. to manage
endoleaks). Hence, the risk-benefit ratio must be weighed individually for each patient.
Contemporary management of abdominal aortic aneurysms is most often undertaken with
EVAR. Endovascular repair has a third of the peri-operative all-cause mortality attributed to
open repair (1.6% vs 4.8%, respectively). This survival benefit tends to dissipate by three to
four years post-operatively. Moreover, the overall complication rate of EVAR in the perioperative period is up to 10%.
Among patients who undergo open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, mortality in the immediate post-operative period can be as high as 5%. Of patients who survive, later death is
typically related to cardiovascular disease burden. Complications arise in 9% of patients and
most often include myocardial infarction, respiratory insuﬀciency, pneumonia, acute kidney
injury, and ischemic colitis. Late Infection of the graft is possible, is challenging to manage,
and occurs in less than 1% of patients.

Surveillance
The Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines suggest that for patients found to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm, surveillance imaging should occur at intervals specific to the maximum
diameter of their aneurysm.
 For patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms between 3.0 and 3.9cm in diameter, CT
or ultrasound should be undertaken every 3 years.
 Patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms between 4.0 and 4.9cm in diameter, imaging
is indicated every 12 months.
 When the aneurysm reaches a maximum diameter of 5.0 cm, imaging with CT is recommended at intervals of every 6 months.
After the abdominal aortic aneurysm has been repaired, ongoing surveillance is warranted to
monitor for post-repair complications and the need for reintervention. As mentioned, endovascular repairs can develop endoleaks over time, which may necessitate another intervention if

80

the aneurysm sac is expanding. Therefore, patients who have undergone EVAR should undergo CTA at one month and 12 months post-operatively. A six-month scan is indicated in
the presence of a persistent endoleak observed on the one-month scan. If the endograft is in
a good position without complications, yearly interval follow-up with concomitant imaging is
warranted. Open repairs can similarly develop problems that require repair, albeit with less
frequency, and hence need surveillance imaging every five years.

is a condition characterized by atherosclerosis or narrowing of the arteries that
supply blood to the extremities.
2. PAD affects approximately 202 million individuals worldwide.
3. Major risk factors for PAD include smoking, diabetes, and advanced age.
4. Claudication is the mildest symptomatic manifestation of peripheral arterial disease.
5. Claudication is defined as reproducible discomfort in a specific muscle group,
typically in the lower extremities, that is induced by exercise and relieved by
rest.
6. Patients with claudication have an overall 5-year mortality risk of 10-15%.
7. Approximately 2-3% of claudicants (i.e. patients experiencing claudication) will
develop limb-threatening ischemia.

88

8. Claudication is managed conservatively with lifestyle modifications including exercise regimen, dietary changes, smoking cessation, and medical optimization to
control hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and or diabetes.

Pre/Post Questions
Case Based Questions
1. A 70-year-old male, who has a history of heavy smoking (100 pack years), presents to
the clinic for claudication-like symptoms. What level of infrainguinal arterial occlusive
disease is he most at risk for developing based on this history?
A. Superficial femoral artery disease.
B. Deep femoral artery disease.
C. Anterior tibial artery disease.
D. Popliteal artery disease.
E. Posterior tibial artery disease.
Answer
A. Superficial femoral artery disease.
Discussion: The prevalence of peripheral artery disease in the general population is be-

89

tween 3-10%, and 15-20% in those over the age of 70. Risk factors for peripheral arterial
disease (PAD) include age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia,
family history and homocysteinemia. Heavy smokers have a propensity to develop superficial femoral artery disease (A). Patients with a history of diabetes have a tendency
to develop infrapopliteal disease (C, E). Patients of nonwhite ethnicity and those with a
history of chronic renal insuﬀciency are also at increased risk.
2. A 67-year-old female is being evaluated in the outpatient clinic for lower extremity pain
associated with walking. Using a manual blood pressure cuff and hand-held Doppler, the
following measurements are obtained:
Artery

Pressure (mm Hg)

Brachial
Dorsalis pedis (DP)
Posterior tibial (PT)

Right
150
165
150

Left
120
120
108

What are the ankle-brachial indices (ABIs) of her lower extremities?
A. Right ABI 1.1; left ABI 0.8
B. Right ABI 1.0; left ABI 1.0
C. Right ABI 1.2; left ABI 0.9
D. Right ABI 1.4; left ABI 1.0
E. Right ABI 1.1; left ABI 0.7
Answer
A. Right ABI 1.1; left ABI 0.8
Discussion: Performing an ankle-brachial index (ABI) requires an appropriately sized
manual blood pressure cuff and a hand-held, continuous-wave Doppler probe. The patient
should be in the supine position and allowed to rest before the examination begins. The
blood pressure cuff is placed above the ankle. The Doppler probe is used to locate the
dorsalis pedis (DP) or posterior tibial (PT) pulse. The pressure cuff is infated until the
Doppler signal is obliterated, and then the cuff is then slowly released. The pressure at
which the Doppler signal returns is the ankle pressure. The same process is repeated for
both legs (DP and PT signals) and both arms. The arm pressure must be measured with
the Doppler probe and the manual blood pressure cuff. To calculate an ABI, the higher
ankle pressure (DP or PT) is divided by the highest arm pressure (left or right). Note
that the higher arm pressure is used to calculate the ABI for both legs. For this specific

90

case, the highest arm pressure is 150. To calculate on the right, 165/150=1.1, on the
left 120/150=0.8. A normal ABI is 0.9 to 1.2. Patients with claudication usually have
an ABI ranging from 0.5 to 0.9, and those with ischemic rest pain or tissue loss usually
have an ABI less than 0.5. Sabiston Textbook of Surgery: The Biological Basis of Modern

management of peripheral arterial disease (TASC II). J Vasc Surg. 2007;45:S5-S67.
3. A 70-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes and no smoking history presents to
the clinic for an ischemic toe ulcer. What level of infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease
is he most at risk for developing based on this history?
A. Superficial femoral artery disease
B. Deep femoral artery disease
C. Iliac artery disease
D. Aortic disease
E. Tibial artery disease
Answer
E. Tibial artery disease.
Discussion: Risk factors for peripheral arterial disease include age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia, family history, and homocysteinemia. Individuals
who are heavy smokers tend to develop superficial femoral artery disease, whereas those
with diabetes and renal failure tend to develop infrapopliteal disease. Of the answers
listed, only the tibial artery is infrapopliteal.
The following prompt will be used for questions 4, 5, and 6.
A 65-year old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco abuse presents
to the vascular surgery clinic with complaints of pain in his legs. Patient states that the pain
is crampy in quality, mostly in his calf muscles, it starts after he walks 4 blocks, and is worse
on the right as compared to the left. He notices that when he stops walking, the pain resolves.
This pain is keeping him from being able to participate in social events and spend quality time
with his family.
4. What is the name of the symptom the patient is experiencing?
A. Neuropathy
B. Claudication
C. Ischemic rest pain

91

D. Bilateral sciatica
E. Normal symptoms
Answer
B. Claudication
Discussion: Claudication is defined as reproducible pain or cramping of the lower extremities that occurs with ambulation and significantly improves or resolves at rest. Claudication can occur in any muscle group distal to the area of arterial stenosis and/or occlusion.
As such, the calf muscles are the most common anatomic location to experience pain as
they are distal in the lower extremity. As the patient does not report pain at rest, they do
not have ischemic rest pain. Neuropathic pain or bilateral sciatica and claudication can
be confused. Neuropathic pain is shocking in quality whereas claudication is describes as
a cramp-type pain. Furthermore, claudication is absent at rest, triggered by exercise, and
relieved by a return to rest. This pattern helps distinguish claudication from neuropathic
pain. This patient also does not have normal pathology, as one should not have pain on
ambulation and needs to be further evaluated.
5. What would be the first step in confirming the diagnosis for this patient?
A. CT Angiography (CTA)
B. Doppler probe
C. Duplex Ultrasound
D. Angiogram
E. Ankle-Brachial Index and Pulse Volume Recording (ABI/PVR)
Answer
E. ABI/PVR
Discussion: Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) is a non-invasive method that measures the ratio
of blood pressure in the lower legs to the blood pressure in the arms. Abnormal ABIs have
been shown to have high specificity with identifying PAD. Patients who have claudication
usually have ABI ranges from 0.5 to 0.9. Pulse volume recordings (PVR) use pressure
cuffs to record the shape of a pulse. The type of waveform provides important information about the characteristics of blood fow. Waveforms can be used to diagnose and
monitor arterial diseases, assess the severity of stenosis, and determine the effectiveness
of treatment interventions. This patient likely has claudication based on the history and
symptoms. The first non-invasive testing to confirm the diagnosis would be ABI/PVR.
While a CTA would provide helful information with regards to arterial anatomy and the
extend of calcification, it cannot provide the physiologic information that one would ob-

92

tains an ABI/PVR. Furthermore, CTA requires contrast and radiation exposure. While
used in measuring an ABI, a Doppler probe is not nearly as sensitive in identifying PAD
and does not provide data helpful in creating a management plan. A Duplex Ultrasound
would provide physiologic information as to the burden of disease. However, it is highly
operator dependent and requires more resources. It may be considered as a second line
investigation. While an angiogram is the gold-standard, it is an invasive technique that
requires the use of contrast. As such, it is not a first line investigation.
6. What would be the first step in treating this patient’s symptoms?
A. Angiogram to identify targets for open surgical bypass.
B. Angiogram with angioplasty/stent of any occluded vessels.
C. Prescribe Cilostazol.
D. Ensure medication optimization for his hypertension and hyperlipidemia, smoking cessation counseling, and exercise regimen.
E. No treatments at this time, continue to monitor and come back to clinic in 3 months.
Answer
D. Ensure medication optimization for his hypertension and hyperlipidemia,
smoking cessation counseling, and exercise regimen.
Discussion: The mainstay of treatment for claudication is conservative management, including medical optimization and lifestyle modification. The patient has hypertension
and hyperlipidemia. He should be on appropriate antihypertensive to control the blood
pressure. With regard to medical optimization, it is recommended that patients start
on antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin 81 mg daily) and a high dose statin. Lifestyle modifications include smoking cessation, exercise training to develop collateral vessels, and diet
modification to lower cholesterol intake. An appropriate exercise regimen is defined by
at least 30 minutes of supervised ambulation/exercise at least 3 times per week. Patients
should be followed closely with yearly ABIs by both Primary Care Physicians (PCPs)
and Vascular Surgeons for progression of disease. While an angiogram allows for simultaneous diagnosis and treatment of PAD, it is an invasive technique that requires the use
of contrast. Angiogram may be considered if conservative management fails. Cilostazol
is an antiplatelet that has been shown to have beneficial effects for patients wtih intermittent claudication, however, it is not a first-line medication. Lastly, while follow-up is
important in the management of PAD, conservative management should be initiated as
soon as the diagnosis of PAD is made.

The term peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is often used interchangeably with peripheral
vascular disease (PVD) when referring to arterial blockages.
Claudication is defined as cramping, pain, and/or discomfort in the hip, thigh, or
calves that occurs with ambulation/exercise, improves shortly after cessation of
activity, and recurs after a predictable amount of ambulation/exercise.
Claudication is a symptom of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Therefore, it is important to
first understand PAD before addressing claudication. PAD is a chronic condition of arterial
insuﬀciency due to the build-up of atherosclerotic plaque (or fatty deposits) in the arteries.
PAD affects 8.5 million adults in the U.S. and 202 million adults worldwide, with approximately 15% of the population aged greater than 70 years old suffering from PAD. Risk factors
for PAD include increasing age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, renal disease, diabetes, and
smoking. The risk factors for claudication are the same risk factors described for PAD, including: advanced age, race (non-hispanic blacks), male gender, smoking, diabetes mellitus,
dyslipidemia, hypertension, renal insuﬀciency, and elevated homocysteine levels (hypercoagulable state). PAD has various distributions in the body including one or a combination of
aortoiliac, femoral, and infrapopliteal disease. PAD severity falls along a spectrum. Some
patients may be completely asymptomatic while others have nonhealing, chronically infected
wounds requiring later limb amputation. Vascular claudication is the mildest symptomatic
manifestation of the PAD spectrum.

Etiology
Prior to understanding the etiology of claudication and peripheral arterial disease. It is important to review the anatomy of the arterial blood fow of the lower extremity.

Anatomy
The arterial anatomy of the lower extremity is a complex network of arteries that supply blood
to the legs and feet. Please find an image here and a description below of the major arteries
from the common femoral artery down to the tibioperoneal trunk, anterior tibial, and dorsalis
pedis arteries:

94

 Common Femoral Artery (CFA): The common femoral artery is a large, thick-walled
artery located in the groin. It is a continuation of the external iliac artery and bifurcates
into the deep femoral artery (profunda femoris) and the superficial femoral artery.
 Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA): The superficial femoral artery is the largest
branch of the common femoral artery. It descends along the anterior and medial aspect of the thigh and enters the adductor canal. As it descends, it eventually becomes
the popliteal artery at the level of the knee joint.
 Profunda Femoris (Deep Femoral) Artery (PFA): The profunda femoris artery,
also known as the deep femoral artery, is a significant branch of the common femoral
artery. It typically arises about 1 to 2 cm below the inguinal ligament. The profunda
femoris artery primarily supplies the muscles of the posterior and deep thigh, including
the quadriceps muscles. It is also an important collateral pathway for blood fow in
cases of arterial obstruction or occlusion in the lower extremity distal to the SFA/PFA
bifurcation.
 Popliteal Artery: The popliteal artery is located behind the knee joint and is a continuation of the superficial femoral artery. It provides blood supply to the muscles and
structures in the popliteal fossa and gives rise to several branches, including the anterior
tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries.
 Anterior Tibial Artery (AT): The anterior tibial artery is the first branch off of
the popliteal artery. It is NOT part of the tibioperoneal trunk (only includes the PT
and peroneal arteries. The AT passes from behind the knee through the interosseous
membrane of the leg and descends through the anterior compartment of the leg. It can
be visualized as the most lateral tibial vessel during lower extremity angiogram run-offs.
The AT runs along the front of the tibia and crosses the ankle joint to become the dorsalis
pedis artery, supplying blood to the dorsum (top) of the foot.
 Posterior Tibial Artery (PT): The posterior tibial artery is another branch of the
popliteal artery. Once the AT tibial branches from the popliteal, the remaining vessel is
termed the tibeoperoneal trunk. This trunk splits to give off the posterior tibial artery
(PT) and the peroneal artery. The PT descends posteriorly in the leg and passes behind
the medial malleolus (the bony prominence on the inner side of the ankle). It can be
palpated on the medial aspect of the foot behind the medial malleolus. It continues into
the sole of the foot and forms the plantar arch, contributing to the arterial supply of the
sole of the foot and toes.
 Peroneal Artery: The peroneal artery, also known as the fibular artery, is the third
major branch of the popliteal artery. As mentioned, it originated from tibioperoneal
trunk along with the PT. The peroneal artery runs along the lateral side of the leg and
supplies the lateral compartment muscles. In the ankle region, it anastomoses with the
branches of the posterior tibial artery, providing collateral circulation.
 Dorsalis Pedis Artery (DP): The dorsalis pedis artery is a continuation of the anterior
tibial artery. It extends along the anterior aspect of the ankle and runs atop the dorsum
(top) of the foot. It can be palpated on the dorsum of the foot just lateral to the tender
of extensor hallucis longus. It plays a crucial role in supplying blood to the dorsal surface
of the foot and the toes. The presence and palpability of the dorsalis pedis pulse are

95

often evaluated as part of a clinical assessment to determine arterial perfusion in the
foot.
In summary, the common femoral artery is the arterial origin of the leg. It gives rise to the
superficial femoral artery, and subsequently, the popliteal artery. The popliteal artery then
divides into the anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries, each supplying specific
regions of the leg and foot. Understanding this anatomy is crucial for diagnosing and treating
arterial diseases and vascular disorders in the lower extremities.

For a short, comprehensive, although advanced video lecture reviewing normal and diseased lower limb arterial anatomy, please see the video below.
Ĺ Note
Here is a review of the lower extremity vascular anatomy and here are two sample diagnostic angiograms of these vessels (Sample 1, Sample 2).

Process of Atherosclerosis
As previously mentioned, atherosclerosis is a fundamental process that underlies the development of peripheral vascular disease in the lower extremities. The pathological process is
precisely the same as with carotid disease leading to increasing stroke risk and coronary artery
disease leading to increased risk of cardiac events.
Atherosclerosis is a progressive, infammatory condition characterized by the accumulation
of fatty deposits, cholesterol, infammatory cells, and fibrous tissue within the inner layers
of arteries, forming plaques. The process typically begins with damage or dysfunction of the
endothelial lining of the arterial walls. This can be caused by risk factors such as hypertension,
smoking, or high cholesterol levels. In response to endothelial injury, low-density lipoproteins
(LDL) or “bad” cholesterol molecules penetrate the arterial wall and become oxidized. These
oxidized lipids trigger an infammatory response. The body’s immune system responds to the
infammatory signals by sending white blood cells (macrophages) to the site. These cells engulf
the oxidized lipids and form foam cells within the arterial wall. The infammation leads to
the proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Over time, the combination of lipids, immune cells,
and smooth muscle cell proliferation results in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. These
plaques narrow the arterial lumen, restricting blood fow. The build-up of plaques can lead to
stiffening and loss of elasticity in the arterial walls, further diminishing the artery’s ability to
dilate and maintain adequate blood fow.
As the arterial narrowing progresses, blood fow to the downstream tissues (e.g., muscles,
nerves, and skin in the lower extremities) becomes compromised. This can lead to ischemia,

96

which manifests as claudication – a symptom characterized by intermittent pain, cramping,
and fatigue in the muscles during physical activity that resolves once at rest. In severe cases,
atherosclerosis can lead to critical limb threatening ischemia (CLTI), a condition marked by
severe arterial blockages and tissue damage. CLTI can result in non-healing ulcers, gangrene,
and, in the absence of intervention, limb amputation. Atherosclerotic plaques are also prone
to rupture or ulceration, exposing their contents to the bloodstream. This can lead to the
formation of blood clots (thrombosis) or embolization of plaque fragments to smaller arteries,
causing acute blockages that may lead to acute limb ischemia (ALI). CLTI and ALI will be
discussed in more detail in the subsequent PAD chapters.
Ĺ Note
The following lipid levels are considered to be “good” in healthy people:
 Total cholesterol: Levels below 200 mg/dL (5.2 mmol/L)
 LDL cholesterol: Levels below 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L)
 HDL cholesterol: Levels above 40 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) in men and above 50 mg/dL
(1.3 mmol/L) in women
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care for diabetes recommend
that statin therapy should be initiated in individuals with diabetes and other atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors.
Please see the ASCVD risk calculator algorithm:
 For patients ages 40 years and older with diabetes: Use moderate-dose statin therapy.
 For patients ages 40 to 75 with diabetes and a higher cardiovascular risk (including
those with one or more ASCVD risk factors): Use high-intensity statin therapy to
reduce LDL cholesterol by  50% of baseline and target an LDL cholesterol goal of
<70 mg/dL.
 For patients with diabetes who have already had an ASCVD event: High-intensity
statin therapy is recommended to target an LDL cholesterol reduction of  50% from
baseline and an LDL cholesterol goal of <55 mg/dL.

PAD Risk Factors
All these risk factors increase rates of atherosclerosis and start to limit the blood fow to the
lower extremities, attributing to claudication.
 Smoking: Smoking is a well-established major risk factor for PAD. It contributes to
PAD through multiple mechanisms, including endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress,
infammation, and platelet activation. The nicotine in tobacco constricts blood vessels

97

and promotes the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Moreover, smoking cessation is
the most effective intervention in reducing the progression of PAD.
 Diabetes Mellitus: Diabetes is closely associated with PAD due to hyperglycemiainduced endothelial dysfunction and microvascular damage. It accelerates atherosclerosis by promoting lipid abnormalities, systemic infammation, and the development of
neuropathy, which can mask or delay the recognition of PAD symptoms.
 Hypertension: Hypertension is a major contributor to PAD. Elevated blood pressure
damages arterial walls, rendering them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. Hypertension
also increases the risk of thrombosis and clot formation, further compromising arterial
perfusion.
 Hyperlipidemia: High levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are a known
risk factor for PAD. Elevated LDL cholesterol leads to the accumulation of lipid deposits
in arterial walls, initiating the atherosclerotic process. Dyslipidemia management, particularly the reduction of LDL cholesterol, is essential in PAD prevention and management.
 Age: Age is an independent risk factor for PAD. As individuals age, atherosclerotic
processes accumulate, contributing to a higher likelihood of PAD development.
 Family History: Genetic predisposition can infuence an individual’s susceptibility to
PAD. A family history of vascular disease, particularly atherosclerosis, can confer a
higher risk.
 Obesity: Obesity is one of the multifactorial contributors to the formation of PAD.
Excess adipose tissue is associated with insulin resistance, chronic infammation, and
altered lipid profiles. These factors contribute to atherosclerosis and PAD development.
 Physical Innactivity: A sedentary lifestyle not only contributes to obesity but also
reduces overall vascular health. Regular physical activity, conversely, is associated with
better arterial function and can mitigate PAD risk.
 Diet: A diet rich in saturated and trans fats, along with a low intake of fruits and
vegetables, promotes the development of atherosclerosis. In contrast, diets emphasizing
heart-healthy components, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean protein, are
associated with reduced PAD risk.
 Metabolic Syndrome: Metabolic syndrome, which encompasses a cluster of conditions
such as obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia, is a potent risk factor
for PAD. The interplay of these factors significantly increases the risk of atherosclerosis
and impaired arterial perfusion.
 Gender and Menopause: Men generally exhibit a higher prevalence of PAD, although
the risk in women increases post-menopause. Reduced estrogen levels post-menopause
contribute to endothelial dysfunction and alterations in lipid profiles, increasing susceptibility to PAD.

98

 Race and Ethnicity: Certain racial and ethnic groups, such as African Americans, are
more prone to developing PAD. Genetic and environmental factors may contribute to
these disparities.
 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): Reduced kidney function is associated with PAD,
partly due to endothelial dysfunction and systemic infammation. CKD patients are at
increased risk of atherosclerosis, uncontrolled hypertension, thrombotic complications,
and progressive PAD.

Vessel Collaterization
Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) often develop collateralization of blood vessels
as a compensatory mechanism to improve perfusion to tissues affected by reduced blood fow.
These new blood vessels, or collaterals, bypass or supplement the obstructed arteries and
combat oxygen starvation of the tissues through “collateral circulation.” The main drivers for
the development of collateral vessels in PAD are as follows:
 Ischemia and Hypoxia: In PAD, atherosclerosis narrows and sometimes occludes
the arteries that supply blood to the limbs. The resulting reduced blood fow causes
tissue ischemia (insuﬀcient blood supply) and hypoxia (insuﬀcient oxygen supply) to
the tissues distal to the narrowing or occlusion. To combat this, the body initiates a
response to create alternate pathways for blood fow.
 Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs): When cells are deprived of oxygen (as in the case
of PAD), they activate hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). HIFs are transcription factors
such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF).
These factors promote the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis (the formation
of new blood vessels) and arteriogenesis (the remodeling and enlargement of existing
collateral vessels) through the stimulation of endothelial cells. Endothelial cells line
blood vessels and play a central role in angiogenesis. They respond to these growth
factors enabling endothelial cell proliferation and migration, which are essential for the
formation of new capillaries in the direction of the hypoxic tissue.
 Vasodilation: When blood vessels are exposed to reduced oxygen levels, they often
dilate in an attempt to increase blood fow. This vasodilation can help mobilize and
enhance the development of collateral vessels.
 Angiogenesis and Arteriogenesis: Angiogenesis involves the formation of small capillaries, while arteriogenesis involves the enlargement and maturation of existing collateral
vessels into larger arteries. These processes are driven by growth factors and signaling molecules like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor
(FGF), and various cytokines. As stated previously, they promote the proliferation and
migration of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, leading to the formation of new
blood vessels and the remodeling of existing ones.

99

 Shear Stress: As blood fows through collateral vessels, it exerts shear stress on the
vessel walls. Shear stress is a mechanical force that can trigger the release of molecules
like nitric oxide, which further stimulates vessel growth and remodeling.
 Physical Activity: Exercise and physical activity can also stimulate collateralization
by increasing shear stress on the vessel walls, enhancing collateral vessel growth. Furthermore, physical activity increases oxygen demand of the active tissues creating a
relative hypoxic environment, leading to collateralization/angiogenesis/arteriogenesis as
described above. This is why dedicated exercise is an important aspect of treatment for
claudication.
The development of collateral circulation in PAD is a gradual process that occurs over time
in response to the chronic reduction in blood fow. While collateralization can help improve
perfusion to some extent, it may not fully compensate for the lost function of the original,
diseased arteries. In advanced stages of PAD, when the arterial obstruction is severe, collateralization may become insuﬀcient, leading to continued symptoms of intermittent claudication,
pain, and impaired wound healing.

Anatomic Distribution of PAD
The distribution of disease in PAD varies among different risk groups such as smokers and
diabetics. Smokers tend to develop PAD predominantly in the infrainguinal arteries (CFA,
SFA, PFA, popliteal artery), while diabetics tend to have higher infrapopliteal disease patterns
(AT, TP, peroneal, DP). (Conte et al. 2019a)
Smoking is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis, which is the primary underlying cause of
PAD. Atherosclerosis tends to affect larger and proximal arteries, including the femoral and
popliteal arteries, in smokers. The buildup of atherosclerotic plaques narrows these arteries,
reducing blood fow to the lower extremities and causing symptoms like claudication.
Diabetes is associated with a specific type of arterial disease known as diabetic vasculopathy
or microangiopathy. This condition leads to changes in the smaller blood vessels, including
the tibial arteries and peroneal artery. The tibial arteries play a critical role in supplying
blood to the feet, making them susceptible to diabetic vascular complications. Therefore, the
microvascular changes associated with diabetes result in a distal distribution of arterial disease
(i.e. toes and feet first).

100

Diagnostics and Imaging
Measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the primary method for establishing the
diagnosis of PAD, however, a proper physical exam helps confirm the diagnosis of claudication.

Peripheral Pulse Exam
In terms of physical exam, claudicants may exhibit signs of muscle wasting with thin, dry, and
hairless skin, or even ulceration. These are all signs that blood fow is reduced to the point that
there are not enough nutrients to feed these tissues. If ulceration or non-healing wounds are
present, the patient likely has advanced peripheral arterial disease (i.e. critical limb ischemia).
In addition, a lower extremity motor/sensory exam and peripheral pulse assessment is key.
Ĺ Note
Pulse exams study the presence, strength, and character of arterial blood fow and are
graded on a scale from 0 to 4+. 0: non-palpable pulse 1+: diminished pulse 2+: normal
pulse 3+: prominent pulse or aneurysmal. 4+: bounding pulse or aneurysmal.
Lower extremity peripheral pulse exams evaluate the dorsalis pedis (DP) and posterior tibial
(PT) pulses using manual palpation. Patients with claudication may have pulse exams ranging
from non-palpable to normal pulse. If patients have non-palpable pulses, then a continuouswave Doppler probe can be used to assess blood fow.

Ankle Brachial Index (ABI)
Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) is a non-invasive method that measures the ratio of blood pressure
in the lower legs to the blood pressure in the arms. Performing an ABI requires an appropriately sized manual blood pressure cuff and a hand-held, continuous-wave Doppler probe. The
patient should be in the supine position and allowed to rest before the examination begins.
The blood pressure cuff is placed above the ankle. The Doppler probe is used to locate the
dorsalis pedis (DP) or posterior tibial (PT) pulse, the cuff is infated until the Doppler signal
is obliterated, and then the cuff is then slowly released; the pressure at which the Doppler
signal returns is the ankle pressure. The same process is repeated for both legs (DP and PT
signals) and both arms. The arm pressure must be conducted with the manual blood pressure
cuff that is placed above the target vessel and the Doppler probe that is placed below the cuff
to evaluate blood fow. To calculate the ABI, the higher ankle pressure (DP or PT) is divided
by the highest arm pressure (left or right).

101

ABI result of <0.9 has shown to have high sensitivity and specificity with identifying PAD.
Patients with claudication usually have an ABI ranging from 0.5 to 0.9, and those with ischemic
rest pain or tissue loss usually have an ABI less than 0.5.
Ĺ Note
Below are the parameters used to diagnose PAD using ABI values.
1. ABI of >1.2: Calcification of arteries, non-compressible. Seen in diabetic patients.
2. ABI of 0.9 – 1.2: Normal
3. ABI of <0.9: Suggests arterial stenosis. (Khan, Farooqui, and Niazi 2008)
- ABI 0.7-0.9 = mild PAD
- ABI 0.4-0.7 = moderate PAD
- ABI <0.4 = severe PAD
ABI 0.5 - 0.9: often causes claudication
ABI <0.5: often causes ischemic rest pain/tissue loss
Below, we will review how to calculate the ABI for the right and left lower extremity using
the following values:
Artery

Pressure (mm Hg)

Brachial
Dorsalis pedis (DP)
Posterior tibial (PT)

Right
150
145
150

Left
130
120
110

For both right and left lower extremities, the highest brachial pressure is 150 and will be used
for comparison for the ankle/brachial index.
On the right lower extremity, using the DP systolic pressure the ABI is 145/150 = 0.97 and
using the PT systolic pressure the ABI = 150/150 = 1.0. So the Right ABI is 1.0, because we
choose the highest of the two ankle pressures for the final value of the ABI.
On the left lower extremity, using the DP systolic pressure the ABI is 120/150 = 0.8 and using
the PT systolic pressure the ABI = 110/150 = 0.73. So the Left ABI is 0.8, because we choose
the highest of the two ankle pressures for the final value of the ABI.
For this above example, R ABI = 1.0 and L ABI = 0.8. So this patient may have some
peripheral vascular disease present in his left lower extremity as his ABI is less than 0.9.
Ď Tip
Here is a video demonstrating how to obtain and calculate an ABI.

102

Pulse volume recordings (PVR)
Pulse volume recordings (PVR) use pressure cuffs to record the shape of a pulse. The type
of waveform provides important information about the characteristics of blood fow. These
waveforms can be categorized as triphasic, bisphasic, or monophasic. Clinicians use these
waveform patterns to diagnose and monitor arterial diseases, assess the severity of stenosis,
and determine the effectiveness of treatment interventions.
Pulse volume recordings (PVR) use pressure cuffs to record the shape of a pulse. The type
of waveform provides important information about the characteristics of blood fow. These
waveforms can be categorized as triphasic, bisphasic, or monophasic. Clinicians use these
waveform patterns to diagnose and monitor arterial diseases, assess the severity of stenosis,
and determine the effectiveness of treatment interventions.
 Triphasic Waveform:
 A triphasic waveform consists of three phases: forward fow during systole, a brief reverse
fow during early diastole, and a second forward fow component during late diastole.
 Clinical Significance: Triphasic waveforms are typically found in healthy, unobstructed
arteries. They represent normal arterial blood fow. These waveforms are seen in arteries serving well-perfused tissues where resistance is low, and blood fow is unimpeded.
Triphasic waveforms are commonly observed in the larger arteries of the extremities, such
as the femoral and brachial arteries.
 Biphasic Waveform:
 A biphasic waveform displays two phases: an initial forward fow during systole (when
the heart contracts and ejects blood) followed by brief reverse or “refected” fow during
early diastole.
 Clinical Significance: Biphasic waveforms are often associated with moderate arterial
stenosis. The reverse fow component indicates some degree of obstruction. They can be
observed in patients with early-stage PAD or moderate occlusions. Biphasic waveforms
suggest that some blood is able to fow past the obstruction during systole but encounters
resistance during diastole.
 Monophasic Waveform:
 A monophasic waveform consists of a single, continuous fow signal that moves in one
direction. It typically lacks a distinct reverse or “refected” fow signal.
 Clinical Significance: Monophasic waveforms are often seen in arteries downstream from
significant stenosis or occlusion. In these cases, there is limited or no backfow during
diastole (the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle). They are commonly found in patients
with advanced peripheral arterial disease (PAD) or severe arterial blockages, suggestive
of reduced perfusion to the tissues served by the artery.

103

 Flat-line:
 A fat waveform (i.e. no wave) does not necessarily indicate no blood fow. A fat wave
form simply refects the lack of pulsatile blood fow.

Doppler
Doppler devices (handheld or otherwise) provide similar information to PVR studies. Instead
of providing a visual representation of pulsatile fow, Doppler signals (sounds) are an auditory
representation of fow. A triphasic pulse generates a triphasic signal (repeated sound), a
biphasic pule a biphasic signal, and a monophasic pulse a monophasic signal.
Ď Tip
Here is a video that demonstrates how to use a doppler probe and the signals associated
with each waveform type. You can learn more about doppler probes and waveforms here.

Duplex Ultrasonography
Duplex ultrasonography (US) is another non-invasive imaging modality that can evaluate a
patient’s blood fow by measuring the speed at which blood travels through the vessel. In
this way, a patient’s hemodynamics can be assessed by identifying the location and degree of
stenosis. Other imaging modalities such as a CT angiogram or invasive angiograms can also
evaluate blood fow to the lower extremities.
A hematologic evaluation (including CBC, fasting blood glucose, creatinine, fasting lipid profile and urinalysis) is recommended in order to identify any associated comorbidities such as
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease that may also need to be addressed.
If patients have normal ABIs and pulse exams, it is important to consider other differentials
of bilateral lower extremity pain include hematologic or neurogenic claudication (pain caused
by lumbosacral nerve root impingement). Neurogenic claudication is positional, often worse
when walking downhill and and relieved by leaning forward (i.e. leaning on a walker).

Treatment
The mainstay of treatment for claudication is conservative management, including medical optimization and lifestyle modification. With regard to medical optimization, it is recommended

104

that patients start on antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin 81 mg daily) and a high dose statin. Patients without a prior history of congestive heart failure can also start on cilostozal (Pletal)
to help with pain management. Patients with prior history of hypertension and diabetes
should also be on appropriate antihypertensives to control their blood pressure and diabetes
medications to control their blood sugar levels. Lifestyle modifications include smoking cessation, exercise training to develop collateral vessels, and diet modification to lower cholesterol
intake. An appropriate exercise regimen is defined by at least 30 minutes of supervised ambulation/exercise at least 3 times per week. Patients should be followed closely with yearly ABIs
by both Primary Care Physicians (PCPs) and Vascular Surgeons for progression of disease.
Below is an outline of appropriate treatment options for claudication:

Supervised Exercise Regimen
Goal of at least 30 minutes of supervised walking exercise (at least 3 times a week)

Optimization of cardiovascular risk factors:
Hypertension - Use of antihypertensive medications - Identify any underlying etiology of
hypertension (ie renal artery stenosis, stressors)
Hyperlipidemia - Control of cholesterol levels - Diet/exercise modification - Use of medications: i.e. statins, anti-platelet agents
Diabetes mellitus - Control of blood glucose levels - Diet/exercise modification - Medications
(i.e. antihyperglycemics)
Smoking Cessation

Pain Management
Anti-infammatories (ie acetaminophen, ibuprofen)
Cilostazol

105

Outcomes
When treated appropriately, most patients with claudication will not experience limb loss.
Only 1-3% of claudicants develop critical limb ischemia and the complications associated with
more severe PAD. While the majority of patients (70-80%) have stable claudication symptoms,
approximately 20-30% of patients experience a worsening of their claudication. In terms of
overall morbidity and mortality, patients with claudication have worse overall outcomes than
the general population. 20% of patients with claudication will experience either a myocardial
infarction (MI) or cerebrovascular accident (CVA) within their lifetime. Moreover, patients
with diagnosis of claudication have a 5-year mortality rate of 10-15% due to the comorbidities
associated with vascular disease. (Conte et al. 2015a)

Key Facts
1. Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) refers to a severe and advanced form of
peripheral arterial disease (PAD) characterized by chronic inadequate blood supply
to the lower extremities for greater than 2 weeks.
2. CLTI presents as ischemic rest pain, tissue loss (e.g. ulcers, gangrene),
or both.
3. CLTI is associated with amputation, impaired quality of life, and mortality.
4. Rutherford Classification and Fontaine Grading are classification systems developed
to categorize the degree of severity of CLTI, which also aids in management.
5. Newer classification systems including WiFI (Wound, Ischemia, and Foot Infection)

109

and GLASS (Global Limb Anatomic Staging System) aim to aid in prognostication
and management of CLTI.

Pre/Post Questions
Case Based Questions
1. A 45-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents to the emergency
department with wet gangrene of his first, fourth, and fifth digits of his right lower
extremity. He has a right dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery pulse. What level of
amputation is appropriate in this situation?
A. Transmetatarsal amputation
B. Below-knee amputation
C. Through-knee amputation
D. Above-knee amputation
Answer
A. Transmetatarsal amputation (TMA).
Discussion: This patient requires removal of the affected toes. However, if only the toes
are removed, the remaining toes are subject to ulcer formation and or infection. If 3

110

or more toes are removed, the stability of the foot can be compromised and thus the
correct amputation for him is a transmetatarsal amputation (TMA). He has adequate
distal perfusion with palpable pedal pulses, and therefore, he will likely be able to heal
from the amputation. A TMA will remove infected tissue and will provide him with
the greatest amputation stump length. A below-knee amputation (BKA), through-knee
amputation (TKA), and above-knee amputation (AKA) are too extreme for the burden of
foot infection. Furthermore, the other alternatives are associated with greater morbidity
and amount of energy required to ambulate, with the degree of severity increasing the

2. A 72-year-old male with diabetes presents to his PCP’s oﬀce for a nonhealing ulcer to the
plantar aspect of his right foot. Laboratory results and x-ray imaging are unremarkable.
On examination, you note that his pulses are nonpalpable. Doppler examination reveals
monophasic signals. He has necrotic, nonviable tissue to the base of the wound. There is
no erythema or evidence of abscess. The patient has not been taking antibiotics. What
is the most likely cause of the non-healing in this scenario?
A. Pressure
B. Infection
C. Inadequate wound care
D. Peripheral vascular (arterial) disease
Answer
D. Peripheral vascular (arterial) disease
Discussion: This patient has nonpalpable pulses and monophasic doppler signals. Along
with necrotic tissue to the wound base, these findings are consistent with peripheral artery
disease (PAD). You may choose to order ankle-brachial index/pulse volume recording
studies. He should be referred to a vascular specialist for further workup before any
intervention is made. He does not have erythema or evidence of abscess on examination,
and therefore it is not likely that primary infection is the cause of nonhealing. The
scenario does not state what type of wound care the patient was receiving. In the presence
of PAD, the type of wound care does not matter as much until the PVD is addressed
first. Without adequate blood fow to a wound, the wound will not have the nutrients
and cells necessary to heal. Bader MS. Diabetic foot infection. Am Fam Physician.

3. A 56-year-old male with hypertension, diabetes presents to the emergency department
with redness and purulence draining from his right great toe. His heart rate is 110

111

beats/min, his blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg, and his temperature is 38.5ºC. Laboratory tests show a white blood count of 14,000/µL. An x-ray of his foot is performed,
which demonstrates gas in his right great toe. What is the best course of treatment?
A. Outpatient treatment with oral antibiotics and dressing changes.
B. Inpatient treatment with intravenous antibiotics alone.
C. Inpatient treatment with intravenous antibiotics and dressing changes.
D. Inpatient treatment with intravenous antibiotics and emergent surgical debridement .
Answer
D. Inpatient treatment with intravenous antibiotics and emergent surgical
debridement.
Discussion: This patient is septic from a diabetic wound infection. He is febrile and tachycardic, and he has relative hypotension. This type of patient should not be treated as an
outpatient. The correct treatment course involves admission, broad-spectrum antibiotics,
and source control with surgical debridement. Gas in the tissues on x-ray in the setting of
an infection is an ominous sign and should always prompt surgical debridement. Hence,
admission with intravenous antibiotics alone or admission with intravenous and dressing
changes alone are inadequate management. Hingorani A, LaMuraglia GM, Henke P, et
al. The management of diabetic foot: a clinical practice guideline by the Society for Vascular Surgery in collaboration with the American Podiatric Medical Association and the
Society for Vascular Medicine. J Vasc Surg. 2016;63(2S):3S-21S.
4. A 72-year-old female with diabetes has a chronic right heel ulcer that persists despite
local wound care. A magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrates osteomyelitis of the
calcaneus, and a metal probe inserted into the ulcer can “probe to bone.” She has a
palpable ipsilateral dorsalis pedis pulse. Which operation would be most appropriate?
A. Transmetatarsal amputation.
B. Below-knee amputation.
C. Local calcaneus excision with full-thickness skin fap.
D. Above-knee amputation.
Answer
B. Below-knee amputation
Discussion: Osteomyelitis of the calcaneus is a diﬀcult condition to treat. The calcaneus is crucial for weight bearing and skin faps are unlikely to heal in this location. The
below-knee amputation will remove the infection and still provide the longest amputation

112

stump to decrease the work associated with ambulation. As such, an above-knee amputation is too aggressive. A transmetatarsal amputation will not remove the infected bone.

5. A 70-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes and no smoking history presents to
the clinic for an ischemic toe ulcer. What level of infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease
is he most at risk for developing based on this history?
A. Superficial femoral artery disease
B. Deep femoral artery disease
C. Iliac artery disease
D. Aortic disease
E. Tibial artery disease
Answer
E. Tibial artery disease
Discussion: Risk factors for peripheral arterial disease include age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia, family history, and homocysteinemia. Individuals who are heavy smokers tend to develop superficial femoral artery disease, whereas
those with diabetes and renal failure tend to develop infrapopliteal disease. The tibial
artery is the only infrapopliteal vessel listed as an answer option. All other options are
suprapopliteal.
6. A 75-year-old male with a history of migraines, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,
triple coronary bypass (CABG x3), recurrent cellulitis, glaucoma and benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH) presents to your clinic due to pain. He has smoked approximately
2 packs per day for over 30 years. Despite smoking cessation counseling, he continues
to smoke 1-2 cigarettes a day. He reports pain with walking for the past several years.
After walking one city block, his calves begin to hurt. He intermittently develops toe
sores and wounds that can take 1-2 months to heal. If the wound is larger, it can take
3-4 months to heal. What risk factors does this patient have that contribute to the most
likely disease process?
A. Migraines
B. BPH
C. Glaucoma

113

D. Smoking
E. Cellulitis
Answer
D. Smoking.
Discussion: Smoking contributes to worsening peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Peripheral arterial disease results when the arteries narrow due to plaque accumulation which
prevents or decreases the amount of oxygen-rich blood reaching your legs. The chemicals in tobacco products increase the rate of plaque formation in arterial walls thereby
narrowing the arterial lumen. Smoking also constricts blood vessels and causes blood to
clot, ultimately putting PAD patients at a higher risk of further complications such as
heart attacks, limb amputations, and death. Cellulitis and other wound complications
can be an effect of peripheral arterial disease, but is not the cause of peripheral disease.
The other options of migraines, BPH, glaucoma have no known associations with PAD.
7. A 74-year-old female with a past medical history of IDDM with ESRD on dialysis, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and previous MI is referred to you for evaluation of
crampy calf pain for the last 2 months with onset upon physical exertion. It has since
progressed to pain at rest. You perform ABIs which reveal critical limb ischemia. Which
of the following will you most likely observe when performing preoperative imaging of
this patient prior to infrapopliteal bypass?
A. Critical occlusion of only the medial and lateral geniculate arteries.
B. Loss of enhancement in the region of the popliteal artery but reconstitution showing
good distal vessel runoff.
C. Enhancement in the peroneal artery contributing to pedal circulation.
D. Complete lack of runoff past the region of the Hunter’s canal.
E. Full enhancement in the posterior tibial artery ending in the region of the medial malleolus.
Answer
C. Enhancement in the peroneal artery contributing to pedal circulation.
Discussion: Because of its location in the deep compartments of the lower leg, the peroneal
artery becomes the most likely artery to remain patent in diabetic patients with vascular
disease. Therefore, when performing preoperative imaging to plan an infrapopliteal bypass, a more common target site for anastomosis is the peroneal artery. It is important
to remember that it is necessary for the peroneal artery to have patency to the anterior
or posterior tibial artery to perfuse the entire foot. Choice B is incorrect because this is

114

more of a presentation in a patient with acute occlusion of only the popliteal artery, as
in a posterior knee dislocation. Patients with vascular disease tend to have more distal
vessels affected before proximal. Choice A is incorrect because the geniculate arteries
themselves are collaterals. Although there is a chance that these will be affected by vasculopathy, it is unlikely that only they will be affected. D is a representation of imaging
in a patient with femoral artery disease. Choice E is a scenario that would rarely ever
occur without proximal tibial artery being occluded.

Introduction
Ď Tip
The term peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is often used interchangeably with peripheral
vascular disease (PVD) when referring to arterial blockages.
Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is defined as the presence of peripheral
arterial disease (PAD) with associated ischemic rest pain, gangrene, or lower limb
non-healing ulceration for greater than 2 weeks duration
The prevalence of PAD is approximately 6% in patients aged 40 years or older in the United
States. Amongst patients with PAD, 11% of patients (approximately 2 million individuals)
will present with CLTI within their lifetime.(Conte et al. 2019c)
CLTI has an increased risk of amputation, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality.

Etiology
CLTI is a severe manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), a disease caused by the
build-up of atherosclerotic plaque in the arteries. The pattern of occlusive disease can be
found in one or a combination of locations including the aortoiliac or infrainguinal vessels
(i.e. femoral, popliteal, and tibial arteries) with varying lesion lengths. The superficial femoral
artery (SFA) is the most common location where lesions occur. Amongst diabetics, it is typical
to find heavier disease burdens more distally, such as the infrapopliteal, tibial vessels (i.e. the
tibial trunk, anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries).

115

Ď Tip
Here is an image that demonstrates the various peripheral vessels that can be diseased
and occluded in a patient with CLTI.
Risk factors for CLTI are the same as for PAD and include advanced age, race (with nonhispanic blacks having the highest risk), male gender, smoking, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia,
hypertension, and renal insuﬀciency. It is important to note that any other etiologies including
venous, traumatic, embolic, or nonatherosclerotic disease processes are NOT considered a part
of chronic limb-threatening ischemia.
Ĺ Note
For a more comprehensive review of lower limb arterial anatomy and PAD risk factors,
please see ?@sec-claudication.

Diagnostics and Imaging
The diagnosis of CLTI requires a prior diagnosis of PAD in association with ischemic rest pain
or tissue loss. Pain should be present for more than two weeks and associated with at least
one abnormal hemodynamic parameter.
A complete evaluation of patients with CLTI should include:
1. A good patient history
2. Physical examination
3. Noninvasive hemodynamic tests
 Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) and Pulse Volume Recording (PVR)
 Arterial Doppler Ultrasound
4. Angiography
 CTA (abd + pelvis + lower extremity with triple vessel runoff)
 If necessary, invasive angiography


Patient History
 Patients may state that they have persistent pain in their legs, even at rest.
 Rest pain and nonhealing wounds are highly indicative of CLTI.
 Patients may also share experiencing rest pain in bed relieved by dangling their feet off
the side of their bed. By dangling their feet over the side of the bed, gravity increases
blood fow through diseased and collateral vessels thereby reducing ischemia and pain.

Physical Exam
Common physical exam findings on the lower extremities include:
 Cyanosis
 Cool Extremities
 Hair loss
 Dry skin
 Muscle atrophy
 Dystrophic toenails (thick toenails)
 Capillary refill > 5 seconds
 Non-palpable distal pulses
 Non-healing wounds

Non-invasive Hemodynamic Testing
In terms of non-invasive testing, as stated above, a combination of ABI and PVR is the gold
standard in establishing a diagnosis. As a review, the ABI is a non-invasive test that compares
blood pressure in the ankle with blood pressure in the arm. ABIs are calculated by dividing
the systolic ankle pressure by the highest systolic arm/brachial pressure (between the two
arms).
An ABI value: - X > 1.2 is non-compressible, calcification of arteries


 0.9 < x < 1.2 is normal
 0.7 < x < 0.9 refects a mild disease burden
 0.4 < x < 0.7 refects a moderate disease burden
 x < 0.4 refects a severe disease burden
Here is an example of ABI/PVR recordings. Patient A (left) shows a normal ABI/PVR
recording, while patient B (right) shows an abnormal ABI with diminished waveforms.
Arterial Doppler ultrasound can also be utilized to evaluate blood fow and detect arterial
stenosis or occlusion.
For a definitive CLTI diagnosis, pain should be present for more than two weeks and associated
with at least one of the following abnormal hemodynamic parametersI:
1. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) < 0.5.
2. Absolute toe pressure (TP) < 30 mmHg.
3. Absolute Ankle Pressure (AP) < 50 mmHg.
4. Transcutaneous pressure of oxygen (TcPO2) < 30 mmHg.
5. Flat or minimal pulsatile volume recording (PVR) waveforms.

Angiography
CT Angiography (CTA) with tri-vessel runoff (i.e. anterior tibial, posterior tibial, peroneal
arteries) of lower extremities can help identify the location(s) of disease. However, this investigation requires a contrast load and should be carefully considered for those patients with
renal disease.
Lastly, diagnostic angiography is an invasive imaging technique that provides detailed information about the arterial anatomy and helps identify specific sites of blockage or stenosis.
Diagnostic angiography involves the patient undergoing a femoral artery puncture to access
the arterial system. Next, a series of catheters and wires are used to deliver contrast. Fluoroscopic imaging of the lower limb reveals vessel anatomy and identifies areas of stenotic disease.
As arterial access is already achieved, immediate intervention may be considered including
angioplasty (i.e. ballooning of stenosis) or stenting.

118

Classication Systems
Ď Tip
Below, we will introduce and summarize the most common classification systems. For a
high-yield summary of all classification systems, please see this paper. (Hardman et al.
2014)
The Rutherford Classication and Fontaine Grading
 The Rutherford Classification is the mainstay of diagnosing the severity of CLTI, however,
Fontaine grading can also be used.
 These grading systems are based on symptom presentation. Patients with CLTI usually
present with Fontaine Grade 2 or higher or Rutherford Category 3 or higher.
 Minor tissue loss is considered defined as non-healing ulcers with focal gangrene that do
not exceed the foot digit.
 Major tissue loss extends beyond the transmetatarsal level with the functional foot no
longer salvageable. Patients with major tissue loss most often receive amputations.
Fontaine Grade

The Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) classication
 The Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) classification was proposed in 2014 as an
integrated lower extremity wound classification and prognositcation system. The WIfI
classification was inspired by the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for
cancer.
 Incorporating the presence and severity of lower extremity wounds, ischemia, and infection, the classification system informs providers of the risk of lower extremity amputation
and potential benefit of revascularization.
 For the limb in question, a severity grade of 0 to 3 is assigned to the severity and extent
of wound, ischemia and foot infection, respectively, where 0 presentes none, 1 mild, 2,
moderate and 3 severe disease.

119

the combination of these three scores assigns the limb in question
to one of four threatened limb clinical stages.
 While an oversimplication, the premise of the WIfI system is that the risk of amputation
increases as the disease burden of the limb in question progresses from WIfI stage 1 (very
low risk) to tage 4 (high risk).



The Global Limb Anatomic Staging System (GLASS) Classication
 The Global Limb Anatomic Staging System (GLASS) is a framework to estimate the
success of lower limb revascularization based on the extent and the distribution of the
atherosclerotic lesion. By categorizing the patient’s lesion into one of three GLASS
stages, the surgeon can predict the likelihood of immediate technical failure and oneyear limb-based patency (LBP) following endovascular intervention. This information is
extremely informative when planning a surgical intervention.
 To perform GLASS staging, the surgeon must obtain high quality imaging of the lower
extremity to score the length and burden of disease femoropopliteal segment (FP) and
infrapopliteal segment (IP).

The Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Concensus (TASC classication)
In 2000, a group of fourteen societies from North America and Europe representing a variety
of disciplines including vascular surgery, internal medicine, interventional radiology, and cardiology convened to create a consensus in the classification and treatment of patients with
peripheral artery disease (i.e. intermittend claudication, acute limb ischemia, and chronic limb
ischemia).
The Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) document focuses on individual arterial
segments and classifies lesions into one of four large groups (TASC A through TASC D) according to the pattern of disease. Recommendations are then offered according to TASC
Classification.
Ĺ Note
Please see these depictions of the TASC classification system: Image 1 & Image 2.
 TASC A lesions are those that should have excellent results from endovascular management alone.
 TASC B lesions are those that should have good results from endovascular management
and endovascular interventions should be the first option offered to the patient.

122

 TASC C lesions are those that have better long-term results with open surgical management. Endovascular techniques should be reserved for patients who are poor surgical
candidates.
 TASC D lesions are those that should be treated by open surgery.
Important caveats: - Developments in endovascular techniques and devices since the introduction of the TASC document have increased the role of endovascular surgery in treating TASC
C and TASC D lesions.
 Many patients with CLTI present with multisegment disease thereby complicating the
clinical decision-making usefulness of TASC recommendations. TASC is more reasonably
useful for assessing lesion-specific device performance.
The consensus was updated in 2007 (TASC II) and included representatives from Australia,
South Africa, and Japan.

Treatment
Treatment of CLTI includes conservative management and invasive intervention. Lifestyle
modification is recommended and highly encouraged and includes smoking cessation, regular
exercise, and a healthy diet to reduce cardiovascular risk factors.

Conservative management
Pharmacotherapy with antiplatelet agents and statins plays a large role in helping prevent the
progression of CLTI. Antiplatelet agents – such as aspirin or clopidogrel, reduce the risk of
blood clots, while statins control cholesterol levels and reduce the progression of atherosclerosis.
In some instances, vasodilators, such as cilostazol, can be utilized to improve blood fow and
relieve symptoms, especially in those individuals experiencing ischemic rest pain.

Invasive management
The mainstay of treatment modality in CLTI is revascularization with endovascular therapy,
surgical bypass, or a combination of both.
Endovascular revascularization is the least invasive approach to opening narrowed or blocked arteries. Using real-time contrast-enhanced images, the surgeon can perform angioplasty (i.e. ballooning of stenosis) stenting, and/or atherectomy (i.e. device mediated removal of the intimal
layer and atherosclerotic material).

123

A surgical bypass, or extra-anatomic bypass, is the surgical creation of a new path for blood
around the area of vessel stenosis/occlusion. Conduits for bypass can be artificial (e.g. PTFE or
dacron grafts) or natural (e.g. autogenous or cadaveric saphenous vein grafts). In severe cases
where limb salvage is not possible or limb-threatening infection persists even after attempts
at revascularization, amputation may be necessary to preserve overall health and quality of
life.
In addition to conservative management and surgical intervention, appropriate wound care
is an important aspect of CLTI treatment. Surgical wound debridement, infection control,
ooading techniques, and daily specialized wound care are integral in promoting healing and
preventing amputation.
It is important to note that CLTI is a chronic disease, and patients may require multiple
interventions, be on lifelong aspirin/statin therapy, and require close follow-up with routine
imaging surveillance for the entirety of their lifetime. Moreover, vascular surgeons work with
a team of physicians from other specialties – including primary care, cardiology, podiatry,
nephrology, and endocrinology – in order to ensure that patients with CLTI are appropriately
optimized given their respective comorbidities to improve overall outcomes. This integrative
physician network to help manage CLTI patients is important as patency rates of stents and
bypasses can be severely limited by a patient’s underlying disease burdens from uncontrolled
hypertension, diabetes, renal insuﬀciency, and tobacco abuse.
Below is a sample algorithm for treatment management of a patient with PAD that progresses
to CLTI. Candidacy for revascularization indicates that the patient is able to tolerate anesthesia and has suitable anatomy - including possible targets for bypasses or the ability to traverse
lesions endovascularly.

124

Here is an image demonstrating angioplasty, atherectomy, and placement of stents.
Here is an image demonstrating surgical or extra-anatomic bypass.

Outcomes
 Patients with CLTI have variable outcomes with regard to limb loss and overall mortality.
 Approximately 90% of all CLTI patients undergo a revascularization procedure (bypass
or endovascular intervention) in their lifetime. (Conte et al. 2019d)
 For CLTI patients who do not undergo any revascularization, the natural history includes
a 1-year major amputation and 1-year mortality rate of 22%. (Conte et al. 2019d)
 When looking at overall 1-year outcomes for all CLTI patients, 1-year amputation rates
are at 15-20% and 1-year mortality is at 15-40%. (Conte et al. 2019d)

125

 Less than half of all CLTI patients (45%) will have both limbs after 1-year from initial
time of diagnosis. These rates are even higher amongst the subset of CLTI patients who
have diabetes. (Conte et al. 2019d)
 As the diagnosis of CLTI carries a high risk of mortality and morbidity even with vascular intervention to improve blood fow, there is a strong emphasis on preventing the
progression of PAD to CLTI. (Conte et al. 2019d)

Surveillance
Medical Treatment Surveillance
 Patients with CLTI have variable outcomes with regard to limb loss and overall mortality.
 After revascularization procedures, Patients remain on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)
for 1-6 months.
 Through DAPT has been show to have increased bleeding risk, it may result in increased
survival and reduced risk of amputation. (Conte et al. 2019d)
 There is not a clear benefit to the use of of cilostazol, a PDE inhibitor, after endovascular
interventions for CLTI. (Conte et al. 2019d)

Endovascular Surveillance
 Early failure of endovascular procedures is common. As such, it is recommend that patients undergo duplex ultrasound surveillance and duplex guided interventions to prompt
long-term patency. However, there are no set guidelines for how long and how frequently
to perform surveillance.
 Recommended methods of surveillance include clinic visits, ankle-brachial indexes
(ABIs), and duplex scans.
 Surveillance intervals can range from 3-6 months.
 Ultimately, there is no strong evidence of benefit of routine duplex surveillance after
endovascular intervention of CLTI; however, patients with the characteristics below may
benefit from duplex surveillance. (Conte et al. 2019d)
Patient Risk Factors that may Prompt Duplex Surveillance
Multiple failed angioplasties and failed bypasses
Severe ischemia
Unresolved tissue loss
Poor Infow

126

Patient Risk Factors that may Prompt Duplex Surveillance
New Infow Lesions

Vein and Prosthetic Bypass Surveillance
Surveillance of vein grafts after bypass surgery may solely be clinical and may include the vascular laboratory as well. The SVS recommends a 2 year surveillance program postoperatively
to detect new symptoms, monitor changes in ABIs, and monitor for stenotic lesions within
graft or at surveillance sites.
 Duplex surveillance and intervention based on duplex findings lead to better patency
rates of the vein graft.
 Though there are no set guidelines for frequency of surveillance. Many studies in the
literature often perform surveillance 30 days postoperatively and at 3-6 months intervals.
 Ultimately, though duplex surveillance does result in better patency of vein grafts, there
is no clear evidence that duplex surveillance for CLTI results in clinical benefits for
patients.
Prosthetic bypasses are known to fail more frequently and more early compared to vein bypasses. Similar to vein bypassess, the SVS does not have hard recommendations for when to
perform duplex surveillance.
 Many studies perform duplex at 30 days postoperatively and at 6 month intervals.
 Despite this, the duplex itself does not always always reliably detect intervenable lesions
as it does in vein bypasses.

Teaching Case
Scenario
A 73-year-old male with a significant smoking history and medical history including 4 vessel
coronary bypass 10 years ago, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes presents to clinic
for pain in his lower extremities. He states that it is diﬀcult for him to walk 3 blocks without
having to stop. He locates the pain in his calves bilaterally.. He endorses he has experienced
this pain for over 5 years. He mentions that he previously had a wound that took almost 3
months to heal. He denies presence of new sores or wounds. He had a right lower extremity
angiogram 2 months ago that failed to recanalize the superficial femoral artery (SFA).

127

Exam
HEENT: No prior neck incisions, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm (RRR), healed stereotomy scar.
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no increased work of breathing.
Abdominal: Soft, non-distended (ND), non-tender (NT)
Vascular/Extremities: Non-palpable lower extremity pulses and what appears to be a
wound that is starting to form on the distal big toe of the right foot. He does have 2+
femoral pulses. On Doppler exam, he has monophasic dorsalis pedis (DP) and posterior tibial
(PT) signals in his right lower extremity.

Imaging
Duplex Ultrasound: On duplex ultrasound, he has a long segment occlusion of the superficial
femoral artery (SFA) and on CTA he has two-vessel run off to the right lower extremity with
well-formed collateralization.

Pre/Post Questions
Case Based Questions
1. A 61-year-old man with a history of heavy smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
and peripheral arterial disease with intermittent claudication presents to the ED with 3
hours of severe, acute-onset pain in his right foot. He takes aspirin daily, a beta-blocker
for his hypertension, and metformin for his diabetes. His right foot is cool compared to
his left foot. A thorough physical exam reveals no palpable pulses or audible doppler
signals in his dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial arteries in the right foot. In addition,
he has loss of fine touch, and proprioception to the ankle. He also has weakness with
plantar/dorsifexion of the toes in the right foot. Based on Rutherford’s classification of
acute limb ischemia, what category of acute limb ischemia does this patient have?
A. I
B. IIa
C. IIb
D. III
Answer
C. IIb.
Discussion:
Here is the Rutherford classification of acute limb ischemia:
Stage I: viable limb that is not immediately threatened (intact motor and sensory function,
with audible arterial and venous signals)
Stage IIa: marginally threatened and salvageable limb if properly treated (intact motor
function and sensory deficit in the toes [or none at all], with often inaudible arterial
signal)
Stage IIb: immediately threatened limb that is salvageable only with immediate revascularization (mild to moderate motor loss with significant sensory loss, with usually
inaudible arterial signal)

132

Stage III: Irreversibly damaged limb with major tissue loss or permanent nerve damage
(profound motor and sensory loss, generally with paralysis and inaudible arterial signal)
This patient falls into class IIb because he has both mild motor loss and sensory loss.
Rutherford RB, Baker JD, Ernst C, et al. Recommended standards for reports dealing
with lower extremity ischemia: Revised version. J Vasc Surg. 1997;26(3):517-538.
2. A 62-year-old man with diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, and peripheral
arterial disease presents to the ED with rest pain,decreased sensation up to his calf, and
diﬀculty with movement of his toes in his left leg. He has been told he has acute limb
ischemia and requires intervention. While you are obtaining consent for surgery, the
patient asks about his chances of survival without intervention. Which of the following
statements applies to his situation?
A. The 5-year mortality rate is high secondary to his comorbidities, regardless of his acute
limb ischemia.
B. The 30-day mortality rate is increased (approximately 60%) if no revascularization is
performed.
C. The mortality rate of acute limb ischemia approaches 20% overall.
D. The mortality rate is not affected by his treatment of his ischemic limb.
Answer
B. The 30-day mortality rate is increased (approximately 60%) if no revascularization is performed.
Discussion: The mortality associated with no intervention in patients with acutely ischemic limbs is unacceptably high, despite the frailty and numerous comorbidities from
which these patients generally suffer.

3. A 56-year-old man with chronic rate-controlled atrial fibrillation stopped coumadin prior
to a colonoscopy 1 week ago. He is otherwise healthy and takes no other medications.
He presents with pain in his left calf after walking two miles in 90 degree temperatures.
He is found to have both absent pulses and doppler signals in both his dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial arteries in that leg. This is accompanied by pallor and pain. What is the
most likely etiology?
A. Embolus as a result of his atrial fibrillation.
B. Embolus that originated from an aortic plaque.
C. Paradoxical embolus.

133

D. Thrombosis from hypotension.
E. Thrombosis from hypercoagulability
Answer
A. Embolus as a result of his atrial fibrillation.
Discussion: The two major causes of acute arterial occlusion are emboli and thrombosis.
An embolic source accounts for 80% of cases. Sources of emboli include the heart, usually
in patients with a history of atrial fibrillation or myocardial infarction or valvular heart
disease. A proximal arterial source, usually an atherosclerotic plaque or aneurysm, or a
paradoxical emboli, in which venous emboli cross a patent foramen ovale to embolize in
the arterial tree, are also common sources of an occlusive embolus. The most common
sites in the lower extremity for emboli to become lodged are, in descending order, the
femoral, iliac, aorta, and popliteal arteries. While a paradoxical embolus is possible, it is
less common. This patient is relatively healthy, so hypotension is unlikely. The patient
is not hypercoagulable.
4. A 68-year-old man with a history of uncontrolled diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension presents to the emergency department for pain in his left leg. A computed
tomography angiogram shows a cutoff sign at the left femoral at the bifurcation of the
superficial femoral artery and the profunda femoris artery. Which of the following physical examination findings would be seen in this man if your suspected etiology is an acute
arterial embolism?
A. Reproducible buttock pain after ambulation, atrophy of calf muscles, erectile dysfunction,
and absent femoral pulses.
B. Bilateral decreased foot sensation, bilateral lower leg pain that is relieved with elevation,
and palpable pedal and femoral pulses.
C. Calf pain that is reproducible after ambulating 50 feet, which resolves with rest, monophasic pedal signals, and palpable femoral pulses.
D. Decreased foot and lower leg sensation, lower leg pain, leg pallor, decreased temperature
compared to contralateral leg, and absent pedal and femoral pulses.
E. Loss of sensation over the foot, complete loss of motor function at the ankle joint, and
mottling of the skin on the foot, absent pedal pulses, and palpable popliteal and femoral
pulses.
Answer
D. Decreased foot and lower leg sensation, lower leg pain, leg pallor, decreased
temperature compared to contralateral leg, and absent pedal and femoral

134

pulses.
Discussion: An arterial embolism refers to an acute event where thrombogenic material
lodges in an arterial tree, usually at a branching point. Various etiologies exist, including
septic and cardiogenic sources. In a patient with atrial fibrillation, a laminated thrombus
with a cardiac origin is likely the cause of his embolus. As previously mentioned, when an
embolus occurs, it often becomes lodged at an arterial bifurcation, usually at a narrowed
peripheral location where the arterial caliber changes. One of the more common locations
for obstruction is the common femoral artery at the bifurcation of the superficial femoral
artery and profunda femoris, which can lead to an acute arterial cutoff sign as seen in
the computed tomography angiogram described in this case. Patients presenting with
acute limb ischemia classically present with one or more of the six Ps: pulselessness,
pallor, pain, paresthesia, paralysis, and poikilothermia. The man has several of these
findings, making the diagnosis of an acute embolic event reasonable. The findings of
buttock claudication, erectile dysfunction, and decreased femoral pulses are a classic
presentation of Leriche syndrome, which is caused by chronic aortoiliac occlusive disease.
Bilateral decreased foot sensation and pain is more likely seen in a patient with diabetic
neuropathy and venous stasis. Reproducible calf pain that improves with rest and has
decreased signals is consistent with chronic peripheral arterial disease and claudication.
Lastly, a patient with loss of sensation, decreased motor function, and mottling of the skin
but with palpable femoral pulses has a high likelihood of having irreversible, Rutherford
III acute limb ischemia, commonly due to infrageniculate thrombosis.
5. A 74 year old male with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer, hypertension, prior
HTN, hyperlipidemia presents to the ED with acute onset pain in his right leg. CT
scan shows cutoff sign at the P3 segment just proximal to the right tibial trifurcation.
In addition to pain, the patient endorses decreased sensation of his right lower leg. On
exam his right leg is cool to touch and has absent pedal and popliteal doppler signals.
What is the first step in management of this patient?
A. Emergent open surgical embolectomy with bypass
B. Catheter based thrombolysis
C. Percutaneous fogarty thrombectomy
D. Start a therapeutic heparin drip
Answer
D. Start a therapeutic heparin drip.
Discussion: The first step in treatment of acute limb ischemia before any intervention
is considered or initiated is systemic anticoagulation with heparin or a direct thrombin
inhibitor in the case of a heparin allergy. In fact, if there is a high suspicion for ALI with
no Heparin may even be started during the diagnostic work-up if there is a high clinical
suspicion of ALI.

Introduction
Acute Limb Ischemia (ALI) is a vascular emergency characterized by a sudden
decrease in limb arterial perfusion. (Creager, Kaufman, and Conte 2012) Without timely
operative revascularization, it can lead to limb loss and death.
Recent data indicates an incidence of approximately 1.5 cases per 10,000 people annually, with
a 9% 30-day mortality rate and a 12.7% 30-day amputation rate despite early revascularization.
(Olinic et al. 2019)
ALI is commonly caused by arterial embolism or thrombosis, with risk factors including
smoking, diabetes, age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history of vascular disease, and
obesity. (Sidawy and Perler 2023a) (Smith and Lilie 2024a)
Clinical manifestations vary based on the affected artery and collateral blood vessels, with
the 6 P’s (pain, pulselessness, pallor, poikilothermia, paresthesias, and paralysis)
serving as diagnostic indicators. These symptoms make sense. If you have no fow, there will
be no pulse. With no pulse, there will be no red blood (pallor) or warm blood (poikliothermia)
in the affected limb. Lack of blood fow causes ischemia leading to pain, nerve ischemia/death
(paraesthesia), and eventual paralysis. Review a pictogram of the 6 P’s here.
CT angiography is the preferred imaging modality, aiding in both diagnosis and intraoperative
strategy. Treatment options range from anticoagulation alone to open or endovascular surgery,
depending on the severity of ALI. (Sidawy and Perler 2023b)

The 6 P’s are highly testable and extremely important to recognize. Again, they are:
 Pain (sometimes lessenes when limb is in a dependent position, i.e. gravity help
blood fow)
 Pulselessness
 Palllor
 Poikliothermia (i.e. cold to touch)
 Paresthesia (replaces pain in later stages)

136

 Paralysis (final stage)
Most patients initially present with pain, pallor, pulselessness, and poikliothermia.(Smith
and Lilie 2024b)

Etiology
As briefy mentioned in the introduction, ALI is caused by a sudden reduction in blood supply
to the affected limb. The two major causes of ALI are embolism and thrombosis.

Embolism
Embolic events occur when material, typically clot, dislodges from a source and travels in
the arterial system until it deposits in a vessel causing an obstruction. Emboli typically get
lodged at arterial bifurcation sites or in atherosclerotic vessels. For example in the lower
extremity, clot commonly lodges at the bifurcation where the common femoral artery divides
into the superficial femoral artery and profunda. Patients who have acute limb ischemia due
to embolic sources typically have severe symptoms due to lack of collateral development (N.B.
collateralization is a common finding in patients with chronic limb ischemia).
Embolic events can typically be categorized into those that come from cardiac and those that
come from noncardiac sources.
The most common etiology of cardiac emboli is atrial fibrillation, a condition that causes
uncoordinated contractions of the atrium leading to stasis of blood and clot formation (typically
in the left atrial appendage) which can then embolize. Other common cardiac sources include,
but are not limited to, left ventricular aneurysms, mural thrombi in the ventricles, endocarditis,
and valvular disease.
Non-cardiac embolism can be caused by atheroembolism, which typically occurs in patients
with a history of atherosclerotic disease in arteries such as the aortic arch or descending thoracic
artery. This occurs when fragments of plaque or thrombus detach from the walls of the affected
arteries and travel through the arterial system similar to a cardiac emboli. These cases may
be spontaneous or secondary to intraarterial wire or catheter manipulation. Finally, patients
with hypercoagulable conditions may develop an aortic mural thrombus that can embolize to
a limb.

Thrombosis
Thrombosis, the formation of a blood clot within an artery, can be due to various causes with
rupture of a plaque being the most common. In the case of atherosclerosis, an acute arterial
occlusion develops on a severe stenotic lesion. Symptoms of ALI in this case are less severe
and more progressive in nature than symptoms caused by emboli as the body has had ample
time to develop a robust collateral circulation. Vasospasm due to secondary Raynaud’s disease
can result in digital ischemia and requires timely diagnosis and treatment with anticoagulation, thrombolytics, vasodilators, or prostanoids. Thrombosis within a vessel can also be due
to a hypercoagulable state. This is usually in the case of malignant disease which leads to
venous thrombosis but can also be due to heparin induced thrombocytopenia. Finally, vascular patients in particular may develop thrombosis from an aortic dissection or bypass graft
occlusion.

Diagnostics and Imaging
Clinical Diagnosis
The first step in the diagnosis of ALI is a thorough history and physical exam of the patient.
While taking a history, it is important to elucidate the duration and extent of symptoms,
cardiovascular risk factors, and past medical history from the patient. Furthermore, it is
crucial to establish whether the patient is taking any anticoagulant medications, and if they
are, ascertain the timing of their most recent dose.
As mentioned above in the introduction, the 6 P’s (pain, pulselessness, pallor, poikilothermia,
paresthesias, and paralysis) can be used as a guide in the diagnosis of ALI. However, symptoms
can range depending on the severity of ischemia and pre-existence of collaterals. It is important
to note that ALI presenting with less severe symptoms may be misdiagnosed as musculoskeletal
disease, sciatica, or other generalized causes of limb pain.
Physical exam findings of the affected limb are essential for diagnosis and classification with
regards to severity and need for a revascularization procedure. Extremely pale skin color in
the affected limb is a sign of total ischemia; this finding may be more diﬀcult to elicit based on
the patient’s baseline skin color. Loss of sensation and more specifically loss of fine touch and
proprioception should be evaluated. Muscle tenderness, particularly in the calf when a lower
extremity is involved indicates advanced ischemia. Finally, a vascular exam with a doppler
should be performed and can be both diagnostic and reveal the level of occlusion.
The gold standard of classifying ALI of the lower extremity and determining need for intervention is based on this combination of sensory/motor clinical findings and a vascular exam with
doppler findings.

138

As indicated in table 1 below, patients who are classified as Class 2 or above will
require surgical intervention.
Timing of treatment is an important consideration; patients who fall under class 2a are
marginally threatened and do not require immediate intervention versus those who fall under class 2b and 3.


Imaging may be utilized in the diagnosis of ALI cases that do not require immediate intervention and transport to the operating room.
CT angiography is the imaging modality of choice as it is easily and quickly accessible in most
emergency departments; CTA reads can aid in both diagnosis and preoperative planning.
Ultrasound may also be useful in certain instances such as rapid, bedside imaging.
Transfemoral angiography or angiography through an alternative access vessel site is typically
utilized at the beginning of an endovascular procedure for intraoperative planning once a
diagnosis of ALI has been established.

Treatment
Initial management
AAs mentioned in the previous section, treatment and timing of treatment for ALI depends
on the Rutherford class. However, there is a universal set of things that should be done for
any patient regardless of their class. Initiation of systemic anticoagulation with heparin or a

139

direct thrombin inhibitor in the case of a heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is always
the first step in management. Heparin may even be started during the diagnostic work-up if
there is a high clinical suspicion of ALI. Initial labs that should be ordered include a CBC,
CMP, baseline fibrinogen, and a type and screen.

Operative management
As far as surgical options go, ALI can be managed with endovascular surgery, open surgery,
or through a hybrid approach. The algorithm above shows considerations for when to pursue
an endovascular vs. open approach.
Surgical Revascularization
Surgical revascularization options include catheter embolectomy/thrombectomy, surgical bypass, endarterectomy, and hybrid procedures if indicated.
Embolectomy/thrombectomy with a Fogarty embolectomy catheter has remained the gold
standard for treatment of both acute and chronic thromboembolic disease. The use of a Fogarty
embolectomy catheter requires a surgical cutdown depending on the location of obstruction,
control of infow and outfow branches, therapeutic anticoagulation, and an arteriotomy. After
the arteriotomy is made, the catheter is passed both proximally and distally until all of the
thrombus is removed and there is confirmation of pulsatile infow and distal back-bleeding.
The last step is an on-table angiogram to confirm the patency of the treated vessels.
Arterial bypass is an option in cases where catheter thrombectomy/endovascular intervention fails or when a patient has known PAD and is presenting with an acute-on chronic picture
as it may provide a more long-term solution.
Thromboendarterectomy is typically performed as part of a hybrid procedure in cases
of ALI. It is often utilized to improve fow in cases of common femoral artery acute in situ
thrombosis in chronic atherosclerotic disease, to collaterals, and to infow and outfow of bypass
graft anastomoses, An example of a case utilizing a hybrid approach would be if a patient
presented with ALI and was found to have a bypass graft occlusion. The occlusion is treated
with a traditional embolectomy using a Fogarty balloon and a common femoral endarterectomy
is additionally performed to improve graft infow.
Endovascular Management
Endovascular surgery for the management of ALI provides minimally invasive options for
patients who are not good candidates for open revascularization. Endovascular surgical options
include catheter directed thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, or pharmacomechanical

140

thrombectomy and there are numerous devices on the market for the application of these
therapies.
In catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), utilized in viable (class I) and marginally
threatened (class IIa) cases of ALI, a tPA infusion catheter is inserted into a selected artery
percutaneously and provides targeted anticoagulation to the affected lesion reducing systemic
effects. The lytic catheter is positioned just distal to the end of the thrombus and proximal to
the origin of the thrombus. The lytic agent is initiated at placement and continues over a 10-12
hour period with fibrinogen level monitoring every 4 hours; therapy should be discontinued if
fibrinogen levels drop <100. Major contraindications for this procedure include a head injury,
intracranial surgery, spine surgery, or stroke within the last 3 months, an active bleeding
disorder, a GI bleeding disorder within 10 days, a cerebrovascular accident within 6 months,
known intracranial aneurysm, tumor, or vascular malformation.
*Mechanical thrombectomy uses aspiration, hydrodynamic forces, or mechanical/rotational
forces to clear a thrombus. The procedural steps are similar to catheter-directed thrombolysis
in terms of percutaneous access and cannulation of the target vessel. This procedure utilizes
an aspiration mechanical thrombectomy catheter to simultaneously provide fragmentation and
aspiration to restore arterial fow.
Pharmacomechanical thrombectomy is a very similar concept as mechanical thrombectomy. In addition to mechanical clot extraction, it applies thrombolytic therapy with a lytic
agent . The advantage of this therapy in comparison to catheter directed thrombolysis is the
decreased lytic dose and duration of thrombolysis required.
Other
In severe cases of ALI where irreversible tissue damage is obvious such as in patients with
Rutherford III classification, primary amputation may be the most viable treatment option.
With irreversible neurovascular damage and tissue necrosis, primary amputation serves to
prevent further spread of tissue damage and infection.

141

Post-Operative Complications & Management
The major postoperative complications of ALI are systemic end organ insults from sequelae of
ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Reperfusion resulting in rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and

142

compartment syndrome must be monitored for. Baseline and surveillance creatine phosphokinase as well as surveillance for electrolyte abnormalities, acid base abnormalities, and urine
abnormalities including hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, and oliguria should be performed.

Four Compartment Fasciotomy
Prophylactic decompression fasciotomy is recommended in cases with greater than 6 hours of
ischemia time and/or in patients with sensory and/or motor deficits. Compartment syndrome
is largely a clinical diagnosis however, you can also utilize a Stryker needle as a diagnostic
tool and objectively measure compartment pressures. Typically, intracompartmental pressure
> 30mmHg or 30 mmHg below the patient’s diastolic blood pressure suggests a high likelihood
of compartment syndrome particularly if your clinical suspicion is high. It is important to
release all four lower leg compartments during fasciotomy.

Figure 1: The four compartments of the lower leg.
There are several techniques to release the anterior and lateral compartments. The common
techniques include making a 4 to 6 cm incision on the lateral aspect of the tibia between the
fibula and the crest of the tibia. A plane is then developed between the skin and underlying
fascia, which is then incised and released. The posterior compartment release involves making
vertical incisions behind the posteromedial edge of the tibia. The great saphenous vein and
the saphenous nerve are identified and protected during the posterior compartment release. A

plane is again developed between the skin and fascia and the fascia is incised to release the
compartment. The tibial attachments of the soleus are taken down in order to expose the deep
posterior compartment, after which the fascia overlying the fexor digitorum logus is incised
to release the deep posterior compartment.

Medical Management
Postoperative medical management will vary depending on the etiology of the acute limb
ischemia incident. If the cause was determined to be embolic, long term anticoagulation
with Vitamin K antagonists (VKA; e.g. warfarin a.k.a. “Coumadin”) or direct xa inhibitors
(e.g. apixaban a.k.a. “Eliquis,” rivaroxaban a.k.a. “Xarelto”) should be initiated. If the patient
was already on anticooagulation, the clinician should gain further insight into if and why a
dose was missed and how to prevent similar events from occurring again. If the cause was
thrombotic in nature, the patient should be counseled on starting best medical therapy with
an aspirin and statin. In both cases, patients should have timely follow up scheduled with their
vascular surgeon and primary care provider and smoking cessation should be encouraged.

145

Outcomes
 Patients with ALI tend to have poor long term morbidity and mortality outcomes
 Bypass for ALI is associated with increased rates of major limb loss (22.4%) and mortality
(20.9%) at 1 year compared to bypass for all other reasons. (Baril et al. 2013)
 In a single institutional retrospective study, the 5-year freedom from re-intervention rate
was 89.2%. The survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 87.9%, 75.2%, and 60.6%,
respectively. (Eliason et al. 2003)

Surveillance
Medical surveillance following ALI discharge
After bypass or catheter based intervention, patients should resume their preoperative medications for angina, hypertension, arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure. Antiplatelet therapy
is commonly utilized postoperatively and anticoagulation may be considered in addition to antiplatelet therapy based on patient specific factors such as etiology of clot, graft characteristics,
and comorbidities.

Clinical and vascular laboratory surveillance following ALI discharge
Patients undergoing bypass due to ALI can follow SVS guidelines for vein grafts. (Zierler et
al. 2018a)
 Early postoperative baseline arterial duplex ultrasound, ABI/PVR, clinical examination
with follow up at 3, 6, 12 months, and annually after.
 More frequent surveillance may be considered for individuals with abnormalities on DUS
The SVS does not have standard surveillance guidelines for patients undergoing catheter based
intervention for ALI.

Chronic Venous Insuﬀciency (CVI)
Ethan Romero, BA, Mark Basilious, BS, Emily Goodman, MD, and Chelsea Dorsey, MD.

Note
By the end of this chapter, students will:





Understand chronic venous disease etiology, risk factors, and classification schemes.
Accurately describe venous disease.
Describe the venous anatomy of the lower limbs.
Outline a diagnostic approach and treatment plan for a patient with chronic venous
disease.
 Describe treatment options for venous insuﬀciency including conservative and invasive measures.
Key Facts
1. Chronic venous disease (CVD) is highly prevalent in the United States, affecting
25% of women and 15% of men, with 1% to 4% progressing to advanced stages such
as chronic venous insuﬀciency (CVI) with venous ulcers.
2. The economic burden of CVD is substantial, with estimated annual healthcare costs
in the US ranging from $1.9 to $3 billion, primarily impacting Medicare.
3. CVD arises from venous hypertension due to valvular incompetence, thrombotic
obstruction, or extrinsic compression, leading to manifestations such as edema,
hyperpigmentation, and venous ulcers.
4. Superficial, deep, and perforating veins play crucial roles in venous circulation,
with dysfunctional valves in the great saphenous vein commonly causing significant
venous refux.
5. Duplex ultrasound is the primary diagnostic tool for CVD, assessing venous obstruction and refux. The Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification system categorizes disease severity based on clinical manifestations and
pathophysiology.
6. The Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) complements CEAP for evaluating dis-

153

ease progression and treatment outcomes.
7. Management of CVD includes conservative approaches (compression therapy), pharmacological interventions, and various procedures including endovenous ablation,
phlebectomy, and sclerotherapy.
8. Endovenous treatments such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and endovenous
laser ablation (EVLA) are preferred over traditional surgeries due to lower morbidity and quicker recovery times.
9. Surgical interventions significantly improve quality of life and symptom relief compared to conservative therapies for severe CVD.
10. Long-term surveillance with duplex ultrasound is essential to monitor disease progression and recurrence post-treatment, with early intervention shown to accelerate
ulcer healing and reduce recurrence rates.

Pre/Post Questions
Case Based Questions
1. A 55-year-old male presents with aching legs, swelling, and skin discoloration. Physical
examination reveals dilated veins and hyperpigmentation. Which diagnostic modality is
most appropriate initially?
A. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
B. Venous duplex ultrasound
C. Arterial Doppler ultrasound
D. Computed tomography (CT) scan

154

Answer
B. Venous duplex ultrasound
Discussion: Venous duplex ultrasound is the initial diagnostic study of choice for evaluating chronic venous disease. It helps detect venous obstruction or refux, which are
critical in diagnosing and planning management for patients with symptoms like aching
legs, swelling, and skin changes indicative of venous insuﬀciency. MRI, arterial Doppler
ultrasound, and CT scan are not typically used as initial diagnostic tests for chronic
venous disease.
2. A 40-year-old female presents with varicose veins that are causing discomfort. She has no
skin changes or ulcers. What is the most appropriate initial treatment for her condition?
A. Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA)
B. Sclerotherapy
C. Conservative therapy with compression stockings
D. High ligation and stripping of the great saphenous vein
Answer
C. Conservative therapy with compression stockings
Discussion: Conservative therapy with compression stockings is the initial treatment for
patients with symptomatic varicose veins without skin changes or ulcers. This approach
aims to relieve symptoms and may be suﬀcient for managing early-stage disease. EVLA,
sclerotherapy, and surgical interventions like high ligation and stripping are considered
for more advanced cases or when conservative measures fail.
3. A patient with chronic venous insuﬀciency (CVI) presents with a venous ulcer that
has failed to heal with conservative measures. What is the next appropriate step in
management?
A. Initiate high-dose oral antibiotics
B. Perform surgical ligation of perforator veins
C. Consider endovenous ablation of refuxing superficial veins
D. Apply topical corticosteroids
Answer
C. Consider endovenous ablation of refuxing superficial veins.
Discussion: For patients with chronic venous insuﬀciency (CVI) and non-healing venous
ulcers, consideration should be given to endovenous ablation of refuxing superficial veins

155

to reduce venous hypertension and promote ulcer healing. High-dose antibiotics, surgical
ligation of perforator veins, and topical corticosteroids are not primary treatments for
CVI-related ulcers.
4. A patient with chronic venous disease (CVD) is evaluated using the CEAP classification
system and scored as C4b. What does this classification indicate??
A. Active venous ulcer
B. Skin pigmentation or eczema
C. Lipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche
D. Telangiectasias or reticular veins
Answer
C. Lipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche.
Discussion: The CEAP classification C4b indicates the presence of lipodermatosclerosis
or atrophie blanche, which are manifestations of chronic venous disease characterized by
changes in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Options A, B, and D correspond to other
classifications within the CEAP system.
5. A patient undergoes endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) for symptomatic varicose veins.
Post-procedure, what is a potential complication that should be monitored using duplex
ultrasound?
A. Allergic reaction to the laser
B. Endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT)
C. Superficial wound infection
D. Hypotension from anesthesia
Answer
B. Endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT).
Discussion: Endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT) is a potential complication of
endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), where heat generated by the laser can extend thrombus into the deep venous system. Monitoring with duplex ultrasound post-procedure
helps detect EHIT early. Allergic reactions, superficial wound infections, and hypotension are less common complications and managed differently.

156

6. A patient with chronic venous disease (CVD) undergoes surgical ligation and stripping of
the great saphenous vein (GSV). What is a known advantage of this procedure compared
to endovenous ablation techniques?
A. Lower risk of procedural complications
B. Shorter recovery time
C. Less risk of recurrence
D. Suitable for patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
Answer
C. Less risk of recurrence.
Discussion: Surgical ligation and stripping of the great saphenous vein (GSV) have
been associated with lower recurrence rates compared to endovenous ablation techniques.
While endovenous ablation offers advantages such as shorter recovery times and lower
procedural complications, it may have slightly higher recurrence rates in some studies.
Surgical ligation and stripping are not suitable for patients with active deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and are generally reserved for superficial refux.

Introduction
Chronic venous disease (CVD) is one of the most common chronic diseases in the United
States. The more common manifestations of venous disease are telangiectasia, reticular veins,
and varicose veins. Chronic venous insuﬀciency (CVI) is a term reserved for advanced chronic
venous disease from functional abnormalities of the venous system, commonly manifesting
with hyperpigmentation, edema, lipodermatosclerosis, and venous ulcers. Common risk factors
for CVI include family history of venous disease, increasing age, smoking, obesity, prolonged
standing or sitting, history of venous thrombosis, pregnancy, history of lower extremity trauma,
and surgery.
Venous disease is increasing in prevalence largely due to the aging global population. In the
United States, more than 25 million adults (25% of women and 15% of men) are affected by
CVD with a disproportionately greater incidence and prevalence reported amongst women at
any age [Azar, Rao, and Oropallo (2022a)](Y. Kim et al. 2021a). Approximately 1% - 4% of
the adult population (2.6% in women and 1.9% in men) is affected by more advanced stages
of the disease including chronic, non-healing venous ulcers (Sidawy and Perler 2023d).
Socioeconomic factors also play a role in disease incidence and progression; patients without
health insurance are 2.6 times more likely to have venous ulcers compared to insured patients

157

(Scott et al. 1995a). Furthermore, disadvantaged populations have increased rates of recurrent
ulceration as well as delayed healing times. This is explained in part by the high cost of
treatment for patients with CVI, though delayed treatment of advanced disease ultimately
results in a greater overall cost burden (Y. Kim et al. 2021a).
When CVI progresses to its advanced stages and wounds develop it can negatively impact a
patient’s quality of life. It also creates an economic burden to society; not only are the direct
healthcare costs high, but the severe symptoms and wounds from CVI can affect one’s ability to
contribute to the workforce. A review from 2019 estimated the global market for the treatment
of varicose veins alone will increase by approximately 35% in 2021 when compared to 2016,
increasing from $290.59 million to $396 million (Davies 2019a). Meanwhile, the management
of venous ulcers in the United States has an estimated annual healthcare cost between $1.9 and
$3 billion, with the greatest cost burden on the Medicare system (Sidawy and Perler 2023d).
Venous disease represents a unique challenge to our healthcare system, negatively affecting
the quality of life and overall health of a large portion of the population. Recognizing the
early signs of CVD and implementing timely interventions can drastically improve patient
outcomes. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that physicians and healthcare providers
in all specialties are familiar with venous disease, so that it can be recognized and treated in
its earlier stages.

Etiology
The peripheral venous system uses valves within the veins to prevent retrograde fow. Skeletal
muscle contractions serve to pump blood forward, allowing travel against gravity and return
to the heart. Patent veins, functioning valves, and muscle pumps are necessary for the venous
system to operate properly.
The veins of the lower extremities are classified as superficial (above the muscular fascia),
deep (below the muscular fascia), and perforating veins (penetrating the muscular fascia).
The superficial venous system drains the cutaneous microcirculation and consists of the great
saphenous vein (GSV) and small saphenous vein (SSV), collectively known as “truncal veins”,
in addition to several other accessory veins. Deep veins follow the course of corresponding arteries and consist of the plantar, tibial, popliteal, femoral, deep femoral, and common femoral
veins. Perforating veins cross the fascial layer, connecting superficial and deep veins. Throughout the deep and superficial veins are several one-way valves that help blood travel toward the
heart while preventing it from returning to the feet (Meissner 2005a).
CVD results from functional abnormalities of the venous system that cause elevated venous
pressure, also known as venous hypertension. Valvular incompetence, thrombotic obstruction,

158

or extrinsic compression can all impede blood return and cause venous hypertension. Dysfunctional calf muscle pumps can also exacerbate the problem. Persistent venous hypertension
can result in insuﬀciency and subsequent infammation leading to edema, hyperpigmentation of the skin, subcutaneous tissue fibrosis (known as lipodermatosclerosis), and eventually,
ulceration.
Incompetence of the valves in the superficial venous system allows for retrograde fow of blood,
which is called “refux.” Failure of valves located at the junctions of the deep and superficial
systems can be a source of refux leading to CVI. For example, the great saphenous vein (GSV)
drains into the femoral vein at the saphenofemoral junction; a valve lies at this junction in
94% to 100% of individuals, and this is the most common site for clinically significant refux
(Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019b). Obstruction of the deep venous system also limits the
outfow of blood resulting from an intrinsic process such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or
due to extrinsic compression. Deep venous outfow obstruction significantly contributes to the
pathogenesis of secondary CVD and has a more rapid progression of the disease with a high
rate of the development of ulcers (Eberhardt and Raffetto 2014a).

Diagnostics and Imaging
The diagnosis of CVD is suggested by the presence of typical symptoms (aching, throbbing,
fatigue, heaviness) and physical examination findings (varicose veins, edema, skin changes, and
ulceration). Duplex ultrasound is the initial diagnostic study to evaluate for CVD. It aims
to detect the presence of venous obstruction or venous refux. It is reproducible, noninvasive,
and inexpensive; it has largely replaced venography as the initial diagnostic imaging modality
for CVD.
Venous duplex ultrasound should be performed for patients with significant symptoms and
exam findings suggestive of venous obstruction or refux, lower extremity ulcers, history of
DVT presenting with persistent lower extremity symptoms (swelling, heaviness, pain), and for
patients where the cause of leg swelling is undetermined. Venous duplex ultrasound is also
helpful for planning interventions. Understanding the distribution and severity of venous refux
is essential. Given CVD can present with variable symptoms and signs, a standardized clinical
classification system for diagnosing CVD is critical to understanding the natural history of the
disease and how to best treat it. The Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP)
classification system (Fig. 1) is used to determine the complexity of the clinical manifestations
of CVD, providing a reliable and reproducible classification system to describe the patient’s
current status. While CVD encompasses the full spectrum of abnormalities of the venous
system, the designation of CVI is reserved for advanced venous disease-producing edema, skin
changes, or venous ulcers (C3-C6) [Eklof et al. (2009a)](Lurie et al. 2020a).

While the CEAP classification system is the global standard for describing clinical features of
CVD, it is not sensitive to changes in disease over time and thus is a poor prognosticator of
progression and treatment outcomes. In response, the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS)
(Fig. 2) was formulated as a complementary evaluative instrument based on ten categories
graded on a scale of 0 to 3 for a final total score between 0 and 30 (Vasquez et al. 2010a).s

Fig. 2: Revised Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS)
Treatment
Management of CVD requires an individualized approach which may include conservative,
pharmacological, and/or interventional therapies. Surgical intervention for CVI focuses on
treating refuxing axial veins and correcting the underlying chronic venous hypertension. Management decisions (Fig. 3) are guided according to a thorough evaluation of CEAP classification (e.g., varicose veins or CVI), source of refux (superficial, deep, and/or perforator), vessel
anatomy, and baseline candidacy for surgical intervention (Azar, Rao, and Oropallo 2022a).

Conservative Management
Initial therapy for the majority of patients with CVD is conservative treatment with compression and leg elevation. Compression therapy includes elastic stockings or wraps or pneumatic
compression devices. Typically, 20-30 mmHg compression is used to treat symptomatic varicose veins, although higher levels can be used in patients with more advanced disease. Graduated compression stockings oppose tissue expansion during muscle contraction, narrowing the
superficial veins’ diameters, subsequently decreasing venous refux and venous hypertension,
which are two key elements in the pathophysiology of CVD (Gloviczki et al. 2024a).


Although compression stockings provide symptomatic relief for patients with varicose veins, a
systematic review from 2009 found there is no evidence for prevention of recurrence or cessation
of disease progression (Palfreyman and Michaels 2009a). The Society for Vascular Surgery,
the American Venous Forum, and the American Vein and Lymphatic 2023 clinical practice
guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the lower extremities recommends against
a 3 month trial of compression therapy prior to intervention for patients with symptomatic
varicose veins who are candidates for surgical intervention (Gloviczki et al. 2024a).
Despite the lack of evidence supporting the long term eﬀcacy of compression therapy, insurance companies and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services frequently require a 3
month trial of compression stockings before surgical intervention for C2 disease (Gloviczki et
al. 2024a).

Endovenous & Surgical Interventions

While conservative treatment is often offered as an initial step, it does not address the
underlying pathology. Patients with symptomatic superficial refux who are candidates
for endovenous or surgical intervention should be offered early corrective therapy (Azar,
Rao, and Oropallo 2022a). Surgical treatment of varicose veins or CVI due to superficial
venous incompetence is accomplished by removing, ablating, or ligating the venous segment
with refux. Current options include but are not limited to the following: endovenous
thermal ablation, chemical ablation, high ligation, ligation and stripping, phlebectomy, and
sclerotherapy (Figs. 4, 5). The majority of these procedures are performed in a minimally
invasive fashion under local anesthesia with or without sedation. For more invasive surgical
interventions, general anesthesia may be utilized.

Endovenous Ablation
Endovenous ablation is a minimally invasive procedure recommended for patients with ongoing symptoms of CVD with superficial venous refux (Sidawy and Perler 2023e). Ablation is
performed in an outpatient setting under local anesthesia using a variety of techniques including thermal, chemical, or mechanical methods to occlude the vessel and prevent retrograde
fow. By reducing venous fow volumes, endovenous ablation treats underlying venous hypertension, thereby reducing the risk of harm to the cutaneous tissues which may result in edema,
hyperpigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis, and ulceration (Hager et al. 2016a).
Endovenous treatments for varicose veins emerged as an alternative to open surgery and are
now the standard of care due to improved safety and eﬀcacy (Rautio et al. 2002a). The
most widespread technologies used for the treatment of truncal vein refux are radiofrequency
ablation (RFA) and endovenous laser ablation (EVLA). Both techniques utilize heat to induce
closure of the dysfunctional veins. RFA works by delivering radiofrequency energy, heating the
vein wall to cause destruction of the endothelium, contraction of vein wall collagen, thrombus
formation, and eventual fibrosis of the vein resulting in a durable ablation (Weiss, Feied, and
Weiss 2001a). The radiofrequency ablation (RFA) catheter should be placed 2 cm from the
saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) so as to prevent endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT).
Similarly, EVLA delivers laser energy to an area, resulting ultimately in fibrosis and occlusion
of the target vein (Perrin et al., n.d.a).
Non-thermal non-tumescent (NTNT) ablation methods offer alternatives to heat-based vein
treatments, employing techniques such as mechanochemical ablation (MOCA), cyanoacrylate
adhesive, and sclerosant foams. MOCA combines mechanical damage with the direct injection
of a sclerosant to close the vein, enhancing the effectiveness of the chemical agent (Boersma
et al. 2014a). Cyanoacrylate adhesive, injected directly into the vein, promotes vessel closure
through infammation and subsequent fibrotic occlusion. For larger vessels, chemical ablation
via ultrasound-guided delivery of foam sclerosants like polidocanol and sodium tetradecyl
sulfate (STS) is preferred (Bootun et al. 2017a).

165

High Ligation & Stripping
Though minimally invasive endovenous methods are associated with reduced convalescence,
recurrence, and morbidity compared to open surgery, great saphenous vein (GSV) ligation
with or without stripping may be chosen for patients with refux and varicose veins in the GSV
distribution where ablation is not an option (Gloviczki et al. 2024a). High ligation of the GSV
is accomplished via an oblique incision below the groin crease, centered over the SFJ which can
be located and marked using duplex ultrasound. The GSV and its six main tributaries near
its termination are circumferentially dissected and ligated. It is crucial to perform ligation of
the GSV close to the femoral vein without impinging on and thus narrowing the femoral vein.
Care must also be taken to not leave a long stump proximally because this increases the risk
of venous thromboembolism.
Recurrence rates are reduced when GSV stripping is performed in addition to high ligation
(HL&S) versus high ligation alone (Sidawy and Perler 2023e). After the GSV is ligated at
the SFJ, a vein stripper is passed distally and a second incision is made near the knee. The
GSV is then tied to the stripper and both the stripper and the vein are drawn out through
the distal incision, stripping in a downward direction, avulsing its tributaries and removing
it from circulation. Top-down passage of the stripper minimizes the potential for saphenous
nerve injury as well as unintentional passage of the stripper into the femoral vein through a
thigh perforator (Sidawy and Perler 2023e).
Stab Phlebectomy
Stab phlebectomy, also known as ambulatory phlebectomy, is a technique used to remove
residual superficial varicosities following endovenous ablation or high ligation and stripping
(HLS) of the great saphenous vein (GSV) or small saphenous vein (SSV). These residual
varicosities, if not addressed, can continue to drain via alternative pathways, remaining both
symptomatic and cosmetically displeasing. The procedure involves making small 1-3 mm
incisions through which varicose veins are hooked, extracted, and removed. This method
has largely replaced older techniques that left larger scars, as these smaller incisions typically
heal with minimal scarring and do not usually require sutures. The phlebectomy not only
improves aesthetic outcomes but also helps alleviate symptoms by removing venous pressure
from untreated tributaries (Sidawy and Perler 2023e).
Sclerotherapy
Injection sclerotherapy is a minimally invasive percutaneous technique that uses chemical
irritants to close unwanted superficial veins. Primarily employed in the treatment of telangiectasias, reticular veins, and small nonaxial varicose veins less than 6 mm in diameter, sclerotherapy can address both symptomatic and asymptomatic veins. This method involves injecting

166

a sclerosant that damages the endothelial lining of the vein, leading to thrombosis and subsequent fibrosis, effectively eliminating the vein. While liquid sclerotherapy is typically used
for smaller veins, larger varicosities may require foam sclerotherapy, which uses a foam-like
consistency to enhance contact with the vein wall [Azar, Rao, and Oropallo (2022a)](Sidawy
and Perler 2023e).
Interventions for Deep Venous Insuﬀciency: Stenting, Venoplasty, and Valvular
Reconstruction
Due to increased risks and technical challenges associated with the treatment of deep venous
refux, treatment is typically reserved for patients with ulcer recurrence refractory to therapies
targeting superficial/perforator insuﬀciency (Sidawy and Perler 2023e). CEAP C4-C6 patients
without superficial truncal refux or those whose superficial treatment has failed may be offered
stenting to correct deep venous obstruction.
liac and inferior vena cava (IVC) stenting remains somewhat controversial and is typically reserved for a specific subset of patients who are most likely to benefit from the procedure. These
patients often include those with significant venous outfow obstruction, such as those suffering
from May-Thurner syndrome, chronic venous insuﬀciency, or post-thrombotic syndrome that
has not responded adequately to conservative treatments. It is now recognized that asymptomatic venous obstruction is far more common than previously thought, and there remains
debate about which patients are suitable candidates for iliocaval stenting. In appropriately selected patients, iliocaval stenting can provide symptomatic relief with long-term patency rates
>70% and relatively low DVT risk (Hwang et al. 2020a).
Patients with deep venous refux due to congenital, primary, or secondary (post-thrombotic
syndrome following DVT) valvular incompetence may be candidates for valvular reconstruction
if symptoms recur following attempted conservative and/or endovenous therapies for superficial
refux. These patients usually have class C4b to C6 disease or disabling signs and symptoms
such as severe edema (C3) (Sidawy and Perler 2023e). Treatment options focus on either
correcting the anatomical defect of the incompetent valve via internal valvuloplasty/external
valvuloplasty, or by replacing the architecture via valve transposition or vein transplantation
(Maleti and Perrin 2011a). Most recently, promising results from the SAVVE trial studying
the use of a novel synthetic neovalve (VenoValve) represent an additional treatment modality
for chronic venous insuﬀciency.

Outcomes & Surveillance
Compression Therapy vs. Surgical Intervention
 For patients with severe varicose veins (C2), surgical treatment (HL&S, phlebectomy)
was associated with significant improvements to QoL, symptom relief, and patient satisfaction as compared to conservative treatment (lifestyle modification, leg elevation,
and/or compression stockings) (Michaels et al. 2006a).
 In a randomized trial comparing compression to surgical stripping of the GSV in patients
with C2-C3 venous disease, VCSS decreased from 4.6 to 3.5 in the compression group (P
<0.01) and from 4.8 to 0.6 in the surgery group (P <0.001) (Sell et al. 2014a). Therefore,
the Society for Vascular Surgery recommends against a three-month trial of conservative
therapy prior to intervention for patients with C2 and C3 disease (Gloviczki et al. 2024a).
 In the landmark ESCHAR trial, patients with C5-C6 disease randomized to HL&S and
compression as compared to compression alone were found to have no significant differences in ulcer healing time (89% for the compression group and 93% for the compression
plus surgery group at three years) but significantly lower rates of ulcer recurrence (56%
for the compression group and 31% for the compression plus surgery group at 4 years, P
< 0.01).

Endovenous Treatment of Saphenous Refux
 Both EVLA and RFA are considered first-line therapies for the treatment of symptomatic
saphenous refux and are preferred over open surgery due to decreased postoperative
morbidity and reduced convalescence time [Gloviczki et al. (2024a)](Sidawy and Perler
2023e).
 A meta-analysis of 64 studies comparing RFA, EVLA, foam therapy, or surgery for the
treatment of truncal veins demonstrated higher success rates for RFA and EVLA (84%
and 94%) as compared to surgery and foam sclerotherapy (78% and 77%) after 3 years
(Nijsten et al. 2009).
 Patients with varicosities, enlarged reticular veins, or telangiectasias in addition to saphenous refux benefit from simultaneous treatment with EVLA/RFA and ambulatory phlebectomy as opposed to staged treatment with improvement in early disease severity and
QoL scores (Aherne et al. 2020a).
 Duplex ultrasound follow-up examination is recommended between 3-7 days following the
procedure to assess for successful ablation as well as endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (extension of proximal thrombus into deep system) (Sidawy and Perler 2023e). EHIT
may be treated with anticoagulants depending on the degree of extension (Sidawy and
Perler 2023e).

168

Disease Progression & Recurrence
 The EVRA trial demonstrates that patients who receive early endovenous ablation of
superficial venous refux with compression had shorter ulcer healing times (56 vs 82
days) as opposed to patients with compression therapy alone and deferred intervention
(6 months) (Gohel et al. 2018a).
 Patients receiving open or endovenous treatment of C2-C6 disease experience varicose
vein recurrence rates of up to 35% at two-year follow-up and 65% at 11 years follow
up (Wittens et al. 2015a). The majority of recurrent varicose veins are due to disease
progression (development of venous refux).
 Long-term surveillance typically includes venous duplex ultrasound imaging, hemodynamic assessment, and reclassification by the CEAP/VCSS criteria.

Note
By the end of this chapter, students will:
 Be able to define endovascular surgery.
 Be able to elaborate on the key principles of arterial access, wires, catheters, and
sheaths.
 Be able to outline the steps and associated risks of common endovascular surgeries.
 Be able to outline new developments in endovascular surgery.

Key Facts
1. Endovascular surgery is a minimally invasive approach to treat a variety of vascular
pathologies, including peripheral artery disease, aortic aneurysms, venous diseases,
and others by deploying baloons, stents, and or endografts.
2. The common femoral artery (CFA) is the most common site of access for endovascular surgery due to its larger size and lower risk of complications relative to other
sites of vascular access
3. Using the analogy of a train on a track passing through a tunnel, a catheter can be
thought of as the train, a wire as the train track, and a sheath as the surrounding
tunnel.
4. Wires are used to guide devices such as catheters and sheaths into a vessel.
5. Catheters are fexible, hollow tubes that are used in both the diagnosis and treatment of vascular disease. In an analogy of a train track, the catheter can be thought
of as the train, the track is the wire, and the surrounding tunnel is the sheath.
6. Catheters are measured in French (1F = 0.33 mm) and the diameter corresponds
to the outer diameter of the tube.
7. Sheaths are hollow tubes that provide conduit between outside the body and into
the vessel, the “tunnel” in the train track analogy. Sheaths are used to advance

178

and exchange catheters, wires, stents, balloons, and other devices.
8. Sheaths are measured in French (1F = 0.33 mm) and the diameter corresponds to
the inner diameter of the tube.
9. A 6F catheter will pass through a 6F sheath.
10. Endovascular surgery is not without risks and complications. Complications include
the formation of hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, retroperitoneal hematoma, fistula,
dissection, thrombosis and embolism, and atheroembolism. Other complications
include wire perforation vessel rupture.

Pre/Post Questions
Case Based Questions
1. A 77-year-old female with a past medical history of CAD, CHF with an EF of 14%,
COPD, and a prior total thyroidectomy comes in for evaluation of carotid stenosis. She
had a TIA with a right-sided facial droop two weeks ago and was briefy admitted to
this hospital. She had a carotid US and was found to have an 85% left carotid stenosis.
Which of the following treatment modalities would be best suited for the patient?
A. Open carotid endarterectomy
B. Transcarotid Artery Revascularization (TCAR)
C. No intervention because of her age
D. No intervention because of her medical comorbidities

179

Answer
B. Transcarotid Artery Revascularization (TCAR)
Discussion: Considering the patient has a symptomatic carotid artery lesion, her disease
warrants treatment. This rules out answers C and D. TCAR is a safe, minimally invasive
surgical technique used to treat carotid artery disease. TCAR and other endovascular
procedures are often a safer option in the elderly, medically comorbid patients, especially
those who have a higher risk of complications (such as those with prior neck surgery).
In addition, TCAR can be performed under local anesthesia with sedation. This makes
TCAR a safer option relative to open CEA, making B a better answer than C.
2. A 66-year-old male presents to the emergency room one week after a percutaneous coronary intervention via right groin access. He reports that over the last few days, he has
noticed a bulge in his groin and when he touches it, it is painful and has a pulsatile
nature. A complete exam reveals a pulsatile, tender mass in the right groin with no skin
changes, but with a bruit on auscultation. Which of the following complications is NOT
associated with this patient’s diagnosis?
A. Embolization to the lower extremity
B. Rupture of the mass
C. True femoral artery aneurysm
D. Compression of the femoral vein
E. Gangrene of the toes
Answer
C. True femoral artery aneurysm
Discussion: In the post-intervention patient who presents with a pulsatile tender mass at
the intervention site with a bruit on auscultation, the most likely diagnosis is a femoral
artery pseudoaneurysm. Risks of an untreated PSA include embolic events, distal ischemia including gangrene, rupture of the PSA, skin necrosis, and compression of surrounding structures including the femoral vein and nerve. Because a PSA is an outpouching of only 1 or 2 of the layers of the arterial wall, a true aneurysm (outpouching of all
three layers of the artery, intima, media, and adventitia) is not associated with a femoral
PSA.
3. A 42-year-old patient with a history of an arterial thrombus four years ago presents to the
ER with severe right lower extremity pain. A CTA is obtained showing no atherosclerotic
disease but with acute thrombus along the distal SFA and popliteal artery. You take the
patient to the operating room for a lower extremity angiogram. Which catheter would
be most useful to help break up the clot over time?

180

A. Penumbra thrombectomy catheter
B. Cragg Mcnamara Catheter
C. Fogarty Catheter
D. Peripherally inserted central venous catheter
Answer
B. Cragg Mcnamara Catheter
Discussion: In this case, the patient has an acute thrombus in her lower extremity arteries.
Although there are many treatment options for this disease process depending on disease
burden and characteristics, the question specifically asks about a catheter that can be
used to break up the clot over time. The Cragg Macnamara catheter is a thrombolysis
catheter that remains in place infusing “clot buster” medication (tPA) over a period
of hours to days to dissolve the clot. A Penumbra thrombectomy catheter is used to
suction blood clots out of a vessel. A Fogarty catheter can be used to manually withdraw
thrombus from a vessel. A PICC line is used for long-term infusions to deliver medications
to the central venous system and is not used intra-operatively for procedures.
4. A 70-year-old male is brought to the operating room for an EVAR procedure for his 6 cm
infrarenal AAA. You have chosen a graft to use and the nurse is asking if there are any
wires that you would like opened to deliver the device into the patient’s aorta. Which
of the following wires would be most useful for this task?
A. 0.018” fexible Terumo wire
B. 0.035” Amplatz wire
C. 0.035” foppy Glidewire
D. 0.014” Pilot wire
Answer
B. 0.035” Amplatz wire
Discussion: Vascular access wires each have a variety of uses determined by their stiffness,
diameter, hydrophilicity, and tip shape. In this case, a stiff wire to pass a large aortic
endograft over would be the most useful. The larger diameter wire will be stiffer, which
rules out options “A” and “D”, which would both be used for getting access to smaller
vessels. Option C is a foppy glide wire which can be useful for crossing lesions and
getting up and over the aortic bifurcation. The 0.035” Amplatz wire is a stiff guidewire
that will not buckle under the pressure of passing a large device into the aorta.

5. A 63-year-old smoker presents to the clinic with left lower extremity claudication and
an ischemic ulcer. He is taken to the operating room for an angiogram via right groin
access. Which of the following steps is INCORRECT when obtaining arterial access?
A. Using anatomic landmarks to confirm cannulation through the inguinal ligament
B. Using ultrasound to ensure cannulation of the common femoral artery
C. Using fuoroscopy to ensure puncture at the level of the femoral head
D. Using the Seldinger technique for first access, making sure not to lose access to the artery
during exchanges or wires and catheters.
Answer
A. Using anatomic landmarks to confirm cannulation through the inguinal
ligament
Discussion: On first access for an angiogram with right groin access, the right common
femoral artery should be accessed. The CFA begins below the level of the inguinal
ligament, making answer A incorrect. One should avoid going through the inguinal
ligament as native fascial planes are disrupted and it can make for challenging upsizing
of devices and closure. Following identification of the inguinal ligament; ultrasound,
fuoroscopy, and the Seldinger technique should be used as above to safely cannulate the
CFA.

Introduction
Endovascular surgery is a minimally invasive approach to treat a variety of vascular pathologies
including peripheral artery disease, aortic aneurysms, venous diseases, and more. Endovascular
surgery is not limited to vascular surgery as a specialty and is also employed by interventional
cardiologists, neurosurgeons, interventional radiologists, and others.
Over the past 30 years, endovascular surgery has dramatically changed the practice of vascular
surgeons, decreasing patient morbidity and mortality in the immediate postoperative period
and the length of hospital stay.
Understanding endovascular surgery as a medical student or junior resident can be a diﬀcult
task due to the abundance of wires, catheters, sheaths, and devices used and orienting onself
using fuorscopic images. In this chapter, we will focus on developing a conceptual basis for
endovascular surgery.

182

Relevant Anatomy and Vascular Access
The common femoral artery (CFA) is the most common site of access for endovascular surgery
due to its larger size and lower risk of complications relative to other sites of vascular access.
Other sites of arterial access include the radial, brachial, and axillary artery in the upper
extremity, as well as the popliteal and dorsal pedal arteries in the leg. The further away the
vessel is from the aorta, the smaller the vessel lumen, and hence the smaller the diameter of
devices that can be utilized in that artery.
The CFA is referred to as the external iliac artery proximal to the inguinal ligament and the
superficial femoral artery (SFA) distal to the branching of the profunda femoris artery (PFA).
The anatomic relationship of the CFA to the surrounding vessels can be remembered with
the mnemonic “NAVeL”, femoral nerve, artery, vein, and lymph nodes from lateral to medial.
The Femoral Triangle consists of these three vessels and nerves surrounded by the inguinal
ligament superiorly, sartorius muscle laterally, and the adductor longus medially.

Figure 1: Femoral triangle anatomy courtesty of S Bhimji, MD.
Correct anatomic positioning for cannulation of the CFA can be achieved by palpating the point
of maximum pulsation inferior to the inguinal ligament, a structure identifiable by tracing along
the facial plane between the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic symphysis. The following
imaging modalities assist with anatomic positioning:
 Fluoroscopic guidance: cannulation of the CFA should be attempted at the level of
the middle to inferior femoral head.
 Ultrasound (US) guidance: identification of the PFA ensures cannulation is attempted of the CFA in place of the SFA. At the level where the great saphenous vein
joins the femoral vein, US will show one large vessel surrounded by two smaller vessels,
which can be remembered as the “Mickey Mouse Sign.”

183

Ď Tip
An in depth review of lower limb anatomy can be found in the APDVS Claudication
Chapter or here.

Ultrasound Guided Access
There is emerging evidence to suggest real time identification of anatomic structures with US
guidance may decrease the risk of access-related complications. A summary to the steps of
US-guided access of the CFA are included below.
Identifying the correct vessel:
1. Obtain baseline peripheral pulses.
2. Obtain a micropuncture kit, containing a hollow needle, guidewire, and catheter
3. Using the US probe, identify any plaque or calcification along the CFA or iliac artery
that may change the site of access.
4. Identify the CFA, which can be differentiated from the femoral vein by its thick wall,
resistance to compression, pulsatility, and relative lateral anatomic positioning. A video
identifying the CFA through the “Mickey Mouse Sign” on US is available here.
Obtaining access through the Seldinger technique:
The Seldinger technique help obtain safe access to blood vessels. In contrast to previous
methods, the Seldinger technique causes minimal damage to the blood vessel thereby allowing
the puncture to be closed percutaneously, and avoids the risk of loss of access during the
procedure through keeping at least one wire, catheter, or sheath at the site of interest in the
body all times.
Steps to the Seldinger technique are as follows:
1. Cannulate the CFA by inserting the hollow needle at a 45-90 degree angle to the skin
under US guidance, blood will fow out of the needle once inserted into the vessel.
2. Insert the guidewire into the vessel. Remove the hollow needle while keeping the
guidewire in place, being careful not to allow the wire to withdraw as the needle is
removed.
3. Insert the catheter over the guidewire.
4. Exchange the guidewire that came in the micropuncture kit with desired guidewire to
begin the procedure.

Closure and Closure Devices
Once the procedure is complete, percutaneous access will need to be closed. If relatively small
catheters and sheaths were used during the procedure, generally below 6 French (1F = .33
millimeter), arterial access may be closed with manual compression by applying pressure with
two fingers over the site of incision against the femoral head. Alternatively, certain indications,
such as use of anticoagulation or large body habitus, may require closure devices even if larger
catheters or sheaths were not used during the procedure.
There are several different types of closure devices. Each type can be differentiated by the use
of suture or sealant to close the vessel.
A common closure device you are likely to encounter on a vascular surgery service is the Perclose ProGlide (Abbott Vascular, Chicago, IL), a suture-mediated closure device. Other closure devices include the Angioseal (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), which deploys a bioabsorbable
anchor to the arterial puncture site with surrounding collagen to promote closure, and the
MYNXGRIP (Cordis, Miami Lakes, FL), which uses a balloon pressed against the site of
arterial puncture and an adhesive sealant outside the vessel that dissolves slowly as the puncture site heals. Less commonly used closure devices include the Angioseal (Terumo, Tokyo,
Japan), which deploys a bioabsorbable anchor to the arterial puncture site with surrounding
collagen to promote closure. Other less commonly used closure devices include the Manta,
StarClose, Vascade, and Cardiva.
Ď Tip
A step-by-step guide to deploying Perclose devices is shown in this animated video and
listed below.
1. Exchange the procedural sheath for a guide wire so only the guide wire is left in
the vessel.
2. Advance the fushed perclose device over the guidewire until the wire exit port is
at skin level.
3. Remove the guidewire so only the perclose device is in the vessel and advance the
perclose device until blood fows out of the marker lumen.
4. Lift the lever to open the foot of the device.
5. Insert the plunger down to insert needles, which will connect the threads of the
perclose .
6. Remove the plunger, which pulls the thread taught, and cut the excess thread

Lower the lever to close the foot and retract the device until the guide wire access
port is visible.
Reinsert guidewire and pull both threads taught.
Use the Snared Knot Pusher or Prostyle Suture Trimmer to advance the knot to
the level of skin. 9 Pull the thread taught while removing perclose device.
Advance the knot over the guidewire and remove the guide wire once the bleeding
is controlled.
Pull both threads tightly and remove the knot advancing device.

Wires, Catheters, and Sheaths
Ď Tip
Using the analogy of a train on a track passing through a tunnel, the catheter can be
thought of as the train, the wire as the train track, and the sheath as the surrounding
tunnel.

Wires
Wires are the first device inserted into a patient, have the lowest profile, and are variable in
properties. Vascular access wires are made of a metal core and an outer wire wrapped around
the metal core. They are used to guide devices such as catheters and sheaths into a vessel.
Characteristics of wires include:
Diameter
 Wire diameter is described in thousandths of an inch and typically range from 0.0100.038”.
 Vascular access is typically obtained with a 0.018” wire and is exchanged for a smaller
or larger profile as needed.
 The most common sizes used are 0.035”, 0.018” and 0.014”.

186

Stiness





Wire stiffness is determined by the metal used as the core of the wire.
The same wire will become stiffer with a larger diameter.
Softer wires are used to manipulate catheters into vessels.
Stiffer wires are needed to push larger devices, such as balloons or endografts.

Coating
 Wires have a hydrophilic or hydrophobic coating.
 Hydrophilic wires have less friction when moving along the vessel wall and track more
closely along the vessel lumen, increasing the risk of dissection.
 Hydrophilic wires are preferable in highly tortuous vessels.
 In contrast, hydrophobic wires keep more distance from the vessel wall and are less likely
to dissect.
Tip Shape

The tip shape and consistency of the wire is important.
Angled tips are used to navigate into side branches of vessels.
Soft tips are designed to prevent trauma to the vessel wall.
Weighted tips are used to cross occlusions.
J-tips are used to prevent wiring of too small of vessels that may lead to trauma of end
organs.

Length
 Wires are measured in centimeters (cm) and typically range from 80 - 300 cm.
 Wires must not only be long enough to reach the target vessel from the point of access,
but also need to be long enough to support exchanges outside of the body as needed.
 Care must be taken to avoid too long of a wire for its intended purpose as it is harder
to control the end of the wire outside of the body.
Function
Wires can be categorized by function. Please find a list of each category with common examples
of specific wires below.

187

Figure 2: Commonly used wires, curtosy of B. G. Northcutt, MD, A Shah, MD, Y Sheu, MD,
L Carmi, MD.

188

Access wires:
 Short, typically 0.018” wires with a soft, non-directional tip to prevent any trauma to the
vessel when entering, and a stiffer body to allow tracking of the introducer and sheath
into the vessel.
Guidewires:
 Generally are characterized as pushable, hydrophilic wires with a foppy, curved or angled
tips that are designed to track through tortuous vessels without causing blunt trauma
to the vessel wall.
 Guidewires are also used for their directionality to cannulate branches.
 Standard Glidewire (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan): can be used as an access or
guidewire. Hydrophilic coating, straight or angled tip, sized 0.018” - 0.035” in diameter
and 150 cm or 260 cm in length.
 Bentson (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN): fexible wire with a hydrophobic coating and curved tip. Used to access vessels that have a slight curve, or to introduce
catheters or sheaths. Comes in 0.035” diameter and 150 cm or 260 cm in length.
 Rosen (Cook medical, Bloomington, IN): stiff hydrophobic wire with J tip. Often
used as the first wire exchanged for the access wire. 0.035” long and 80 cm to 260 cm in
length.
Rail wires:
 Used as a platform to support catheter and sheath exchanges, as well as to advance
devices, such as stents or endografts.
 Rail wires come in a range of stiffness, from medium to very stiff.
 They may have a straight, foppy, or curved tip.
Medium stiffness rail wires:
 Bentson (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN): fexible wire with a hydrophobic coating and curved tip. Used to access vessels that have a slight curve, or to introduce
catheters or sheaths. Comes in 0.035” diameter and 150 cm or 260 cm in length.
 Rosen (Cook medical, Bloomington, IN): stiff hydrophobic wire with J tip. Often
used as the first wire exchanged for the access wire. 0.035” long and 80 cm to 260 cm in
length.
High stiffness rail wires:
 Amplatz (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA): stiff, hydrophobic, straight
foppy or J-tip. 0.035” - 0.038” diameter and 75 cm - 260 cm in length.

189

 Lunderquist (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN): one of the stiffest wires, hydrophobic, with foppy or curved tip. 0.035” diameter and 90 cm - 300 cm in length. Often
used to advance large endografts.

Catheters
Catheters are fexible, hollow tubes that are used in both the diagnosis and treatment of
vascular disease.
Ĺ Note
Catheters are measured in French (1F = 0.33 mm) and the diameter corresponds to the
outer diameter of the tube.

Figure 3: Outer diameter = OD, Inner diameter = ID.
Catheters vary by size, stiffness, hydrophilicity, radiopacity, and functionality, but can generally be described in two categories, fush catheters and selective catheters.
Flush catheters:
 Contain multiple side holes just proximal to the end of the device to allow for the injection
of contrast or other material, such as thrombolytics.
 Omnifush (Angiodynamics, Latham, NY): soft, fexible catheter with a radiopaque
tip that is able to administer contrast to visualize vessels. Omnifush device on back table
 Pigtail (Angiodynamics, Latham, NY): Similar to the Omnifush with a looped
end (Image YY).

190

Selective catheters:
 Contain one hole at the distal end of the tube.
 Selective catheters come in many different shapes and sizes.
 Intuitively, the anatomy of the vessel to be tracked will determine the diameter and tip
shape.
 When attempting to cross the aortic bifurcation into the contralateral common iliac
artery, a catheter with more of a J-tip or “Shepherd’s hook” is preferable.
 When attempting to cannulate vessel branches with a more acute angle, a smaller angle
catheter tip should be selected.
 Selective catheters can also be used to deliver contrast, but the contrast is only able to
leave the catheter through the end of the device.
 Angiograms with selective catheters are more tailored to specific vessels, such as a renal
or mesenteric artery.
 Selective Glidecath (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan): hydrophilic catheter available in 17
different shapes, but the 45 degree is most common. Comes in 4F or 5F. Offers great
trackability and pushability. This image depicts some of the glidecath tip shapes.

Sheaths
Sheaths are hollow tubes that provide a conduit between outer environment (i.e. outside the
body) and the vessel. Returning to our train analogy, a sheath is the “tunnel” that the track
and train run through.
Sheaths are used to advance and exchange catheters, wires, stents, balloons, and other devices.
Sheaths can be divided into short sheaths for access and long sheaths for diagnostics and
treatment. Long sheaths are fexible enough to track along different vessels, but are also stiff
enough to support the advancement or exchange of devices.
Ĺ Note
Sheaths are measured in French (1F = 0.33 mm) and the diameter corresponds to the
inner diameter of the tube.
As such, a 6F catheter will pass through a 6F sheath.
Key points about sheaths:
 Sheaths are measured based on the inner diameter of the sheath, in contrast to catheters,
which are measured based on their outer diameter.
 Sheaths contain a removable introducer, which is used to expand the tract from the
outside into the vessel, and provide a smooth transition between the wire and the sheath.

191

 The side port on sheaths is used to fush the inner device with heparinized saline to
prevent thrombus formation and distal embolization. It can also be used to inject contrast
for diagnostic purposes.
 Sheaths come in variable diameters, lengths, and tips.
 Some sheaths, such as the TourGuide (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) are steerable.
The operator can defect the sheath tip up to 180 degrees. This is advantageous when
cannulating branch arteries with sharp angles.
It is also helpful to understand what diameter of sheath can be inserted into different points
of access as this will change the approach for the procedure. Though there is variation across
patients, the table below is a useful starting point to understand what size sheath can be
inserted in target access arteries.

Artery                  Inner Diameter (mm)         Typical Access Sheath size (F)
Radial                  2.3                         4-6
Brachial                                            5-7
Axillary                                            5-14
Common Femoral          6.6                         5-24
Popliteal               4.7                         4-6
Pedal                   2.1                         4

Balloons, Stents, and Endografts
The delivery system for balloons consists of a catheter over the wire with the balloon built
into the catheter tip. As such, advancing the balloon into place for angioplasty is no different
from advancing a small catheter without a balloon.
Similar to balloons, stents are contained in catheters that are advanced into position over wires.
The interventional component (i.e. stent) is near the tip of the catheter.
Both stents and balloons can elute drugs, most commonly Paclitaxel, an antiproliferative agent.
Paclitaxel is lipophilic and remains active in the vessel wall following the procedure, preventing
neointimal hyperplasia and improving patency.The impetus for using a drug-eluting stent or
balloon in place of a standard stent or balloon is to decrease the chances of vascular remodeling
following the procedure that may lead to restenosis.
In contrast to drug-eluting stents, drug-eluting balloons have the advantage of not leaving
hardware in the vessel after intervention. Contrarily, drug-eluting stents remain in the vessel
lumen after intervention, but are able to continue providing radial force.

192

Balloons
Balloons are versatile endovascular tools and can be categorized by the degree to which they
assume of the shape of the vessel.
Compliant balloons: - Compliant balloons infate to a specific volume and conform to the
shape of the vessel. - For example, the Fogarty balloon is a compliant balloon that can be
used to remove thrombi in both open and endovascular procedures.
Semi-Compliant balloons: - These balloons have a slightly more rigid shape and therefore
conform to a lesser degree to the shape of the container (i.e. vessel). - The Coda balloon
(Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) is semi-compliant and used to temporarily occlude
large vessels.
Non-Compliant balloons: - Non-compliant infate to a predetermined shape and size. They are commonly used in angioplasty of peripheral and/or visceral stenosed vessels.

Figure 4: Angioplasty with a non-compliant balloon courtesty of J. Heuser, and Wikimedia.
Intraoperatively surgeons will often ask for the pressures of the balloon before using. Noncompliant balloons have a nominal pressure, which is the average pressure in atmospheres
(atm) required to infate the balloon to its predetermined size, and a burst pressure, where
99.9% of balloons will not burst if infated to this pressure.

193

Stents
Stents may be covered or uncovered. Covered stents do not allow fow between the lumen
of the stent and surrounding tissues, in contrast to uncovered (bare metal) stents which
do allow fow through the stent.
Stents can be categorized by the means of deployment.
Self-expanding stents use a recoil mechanism during deployment to achieve a set diameter
using stored energy from the packing of the stent.
Key characteristics of self-expanding stents:

Flexible
Low profile
Deformable
Low radial force (lower dissection risk)

Balloon-expandable stents are packaged around a balloon. The surgeon uses the balloon
inside the stent to achieve a specific diameter based on the pressure used to infate the balloon. As the diameter of the stent increases with higher balloon pressure, the length of stent
decreases.
Key characteristics of balloon-expandable stents:


Rigid
Large profile
Maintains shape over time
More accurate deployment
High radial force (higher risk of dissection)

Ď Tip
Highly tortuous vessels often require a self-expanding stent because of the increased
fexibility needed to prevent kinking or in-stent restenosis.
Heavily calcified vessels often require the increased radial force of balloonexpandable stents to achieve full patency.

Endografts
Endografts are tubes of fabric and interwoven metal used to exclude the diseased segment of
an artery from circulation. The goal of an endograft is to prevent rupture or sac enlargement
of an aneurysm by depressurizing the arterial walls.

194

Figure 5: Balloon-expandable stent deployment courtesty of Blausen Medical. Retrieved on
22 February 20. Wikimedia.

195

Endografts are comparatively larger than stents and can require very large sheaths (>18F for
endovascular aortic repair). To treat an aortic aneurysm with an endograft, there must be
adequate sealing zones of healthy aorta above and below the aneurysm.
Ĺ Note
Please see the AAA Chapter for a full review of endovascular aortic repair (EVAR).
Please see the TAA/TAAA Chapter for a full review of thoracic endovascualr aortic repair
(TEVAR)
For patients that have extension of the aneurysm into the visceral vessels of the aorta, the
use of a conventional, non-fenestrated endograft would block blood fow to the branches of the
diseased segment of the aorta, such as the kidneys or bowel. Treatment of thoracoabdominal
or complex abdominal aortic aneurysms with endovascular repair requires a graft that allows
fow to branches of the aorta. Some common techniques for maintaining visceral blood fow
include :
Fenestrated endografts include small, circular holes in the main body of the endograft.
The french word for window is “fenêtre.” When the fenstrations (or windows) are placed in
line with visceral vessel origins, balloon-expandable stents can be used to bridge to the main
endograft to the native renal or mesenteric arteries.
Additional characteristics about fenestrated grafts:
 They are ideal when the inner aortic diameter is small, making for a short distance (<5
mm) between the endograft and native visceral artery.
 They require the pathway between the endograft and the native artery to be close to
perpendicular; that is, the pathway for the stent out of the graft cannot be at too large
of an angle due to risk of stent fracture or kinking.
 The part of the stent inside the endograft must be fared out with a balloon to prevent
endoleak from inside the endograft into the aneurysm sac.
 An of a commercially available fenestrated endograft is the Cook Medical Zenith Fenestrated (ZFen) AAA endograft. Click here to watch an animation of ZFen deployment.
Branched endografts have side branches built-into the main body of the graft in place of
fenestration. These branches extend from the outer body of the main graft towards the target
vessel.
Additional characteristics about branched grafts:
 They require a larger inner aortic diameter for more space between the endograft and
target artery.
 Branches can receive self-expanding or balloon-expandable stents.

196

Common Endovascular Procedures
Vascular surgeons perform a number of endovascular procedures. The most common include
placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, diagnostic angiograms with angioplasty and
stenting, fistulagrams, endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), and thrombectomy and thrombolysis. There are a number of basics that trainees should know before starting one of these
procedures.

IVC Filter Placement
 An IVC Filter is a metal cage-like device placed in the IVC to prevent clots from embolizing to the pulmonary vasculature.
 The hook at the superior aspect of the filter is used to aid with retrieval.
 The struts will catch clots and will anchor into the walls of the IVC to prevent migration.
 Placement of an IVC filter can be controversial but it is commonly used to prevent
pulmonary embolism in patients who have a strict contraindication to anticoagulation.
 They are sometimes placed prophylactically in high-risk trauma patients.

Figure 6: Inferior Vena Cava Filter courtesy of scientificanimations.com. Retrieved on 30
March. Wikimedia.
Procedure:
 Access is usually obtained via the right femoral vein as it gives direct access to the IVC.
 Ultrasound should be used to confirm that there is no thrombus at the access site Access is then obtained via the Seldinger technique and a venacavogram is then obtained
to assess the anatomy and the location of the renal veins
 The filter is generally placed just below the renal veins to prevent renal vein thrombus
if filter thrombosis occurs.
 If a retrievable filter is placed, it should be removed as soon as the filter is no longer
clinically indicated.
 Filter retrieval becomes more challenging the longer the filter remains in place.

197

 Filter retrieval is generally performed through the internal jugular vein in the neck to
give access to the hook at the superior end of the filter, which can be snared and removed.
Ĺ Note
Please find a more detailed review of IVC filters here

Lower Extremity Angiogram
A lower extremity angiogram is the starting point for a vascular surgeon to perform a number
of different interventions including angioplasty, stenting, and thrombectomy. An angiogram
is a procedure in which contrast dye is used to display the vasculature and its disease burden
under X-ray.
Ď Tip
Before an angiogram, one should be aware of all prior interventions a patient has had,
both open and endovascular. It can be useful to review old operative reports and imaging
studies in order to know the patient’s current anatomy.
Ď Tip
In addition, the patient’s most recent imaging studies should be reviewed including
ABI/PVRs, arterial duplex, and any axial imaging such as a CTA.
Please see Claudication Chapter for a summary of ABI/PVR testing and interpretation.
Procedure:
 Access is typically obtained in the contralateral common femoral artery and a wire and
catheter are passed up and over the aortic bifurcation to gain access to the operative
(ipsilateral) side.
 A series of angiograms are taken to assess the level of disease and based on this a final
operative plan will be made.
 There are multiple options for treatment including angioplasty, stenting, atherectomy,
thrombectomy, and thrombolysis, to name a few.
Possible Interventions:
 Angioplasty: a balloon is advanced across the area of concern (usually atherosclerosis
causing a fow limitation) and expanded to dilate the area of stenosis.

198

 Stenting: commonly after an angioplasty, a stent is placed to maintain patency of the
area. There are multiple types of stents (covered above) that can be used depending on
anatomic location, size, and indication.
 Atherectomy: a procedure where a calcified plaque is physically removed from the
artery. This can be done with a cutting blade, a spinning drill-like device, or a laser.
Ĺ Note
Considerations for Atherectomy
As plaque is broken into smaller pieces, there is a significant risk for distal embolization
of plaque debris. To prevent this, an embolic protection device is often used which can
filter blood and catch any smaller particulate matter that travels distally. Some of the
devices include an aspiration device to remove clot and thrombus as it is removed.
There is ongoing research into the outcomes of atherectomy versus stenting alone, but
generally, the long-term patency rate is similar.(“Atherectomy for Lower Extremity Intervention: Why, When, and Which Device?” n.d.)
 Thrombolysis: a procedure where the clot is dissolved often with tPA and heparin
to treat an acute thrombotic event. Often, angiograms are performed for acute limb
ischemia from a clot rather than atherosclerotic disease. A lysis catheter or CraggMacnamara catheter can be placed. The Cragg-Macnamara catheter is a long
catheter with multiple side ports where medication can be infused over the length of
a thrombosed artery. This catheter can be left in place for 24-48 hours and the medication is allowed to “bust” the acute clot. After this, the patient will be brought back
to the operating room to evaluate the progress of the clot dissolution.(Giannakakis et al.
2017)
 Thrombectomy: a procedure where acute or subacute thrombus is removed from a vessel. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Commonly, a suction thrombectomy
system can be used to remove thrombus from a vessel using vacuum force for example
using the Penumbra system. Alternatively, a mechanical thrombectomy can be performed where a Fogarty catheter is deployed past a thrombus, a balloon infated at the
end of the catheter, and then manually pulled back towards an arteriotomy and the clot
then removed.(Karnabatidis et al. 2011)

Fistulograms
A fistulogram is an angiographic study used to interrogate and troubleshoot a disfunctional
arteriovenous fistula.
Common complications of fistulas include:
 Anastomotic strictures.

199

 Infow issues (such as atherosclerosis of the infow artery).
 Outfow issues (such as central venous stenosis).
 Thrombosed fistula.
Access is obtained in different locations depending on the culprit lesions (the infow artery, the
fistula itself, the outfow veins) and can be treated with angioplasty and or stenting.

Risks
As with any invasive procedure, even a minimally invasive procedure comes with its own set
of risks, and as the complexity of the procedure increases so does the risk.
The American Heart Association has put out guidelines to help stratify patients at risk for
vascular complications.(Patel et al. 2010a)
Low risk cases were defined as those with a complication rate below 1%. Characteristics
include:


Diagnostic angiograms without interventions.
Short operative times.
Small sheaths (5 Fr).
Minimal anticoagulation.
Younger male patients with larger body habitus and normal renal function were at lowest
risk of complications.

Moderate risk cases were defined as those with a complication rate of 1-3%. Risk factors
include:
 Longer, more complex procedures.
 Involve larger sheaths (6-7Fr).
High risk cases were defined as those with a complication rate >3%. Risk factors include:

Peripheral arterial disease patients
Advanced age
Female sex at birth
Liver disease
Coagulopathy
Immunosuppression
Status post valve replacement
Renal dysfunction.
Longer procedure times

 Larger sheaths (>8Fr), use of arterial closure devices
 More likely to involve anticoagulation

Access Complications
Although each procedure comes with its own specific risks (e.g. stroke for a carotid artery stent,
distal embolization for atherectomy etc), there are multiple complications that can occur with
any endovascular procedure. The procedure specific complications will be explored in further
detail in each chapter. Common access complications are listed below.
Groin Hematoma
A groin hematoma is a collection of blood that has collected outside the lumen of the vessel,
which often occurs after removal of the sheath.
Groin hematoma characteristics:
 Occur in about 1-3 % of cases
 Often due to a stick not directly over the femoral head in which case manual pressure
may not provide adequate hemostasis.
 Hematomas are rarely ever operated on unless they case skin compromise, severe pain,
femoral nerve compression, or are rapidly expanding.
 Hematoma will generally be absorbed by the body.
 If they are operated on, there is a significant risk of infection (about 20%) and seroma
formation.
Pseudoaneurysms
A pseudoaneurysm is defined as a collection of turbulent blood fow contained only by one
or two layers of the arterial wall as opposed to a true aneurysm where all three layers are
dilated (occur in less than 1% of endovascular cases). They occur secondary to injury
(iatrogenic or trauma).
These must be managed urgently and treated appropriately to prevent significant
morbidity and mortality.
Pseudoaneurysm presentation:
 Pulsatile often painful mass at a prior access site
 May lead to skin necrosis
 Bruit on auscultation

201

Pseudoaneurysm risks:






Vessel rupture
Thrombus formation with distal embolization
Skin necrosis
Nerve compression
Venous compression

Etiology:
Most often, seen at the femoral artery as an access site complication from:
 Failed deployment of a closure device
 Laceration of the artery or branch by an access needle
 Inadequate pressure or length of pressure being held.
Patients who are obese, female, hypertensive or are on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy
are at higher risk for femoral PSA.
Workup:
 Duplex ultrasound of the site.
 Pulse exam to ensure adequate distal perfusion.
Management:
Management is dependent on size and presentation of the pseudoaneurysm. In the past, all
pseudoaneurysms were treated operatively, but with new advances, minimally invasive techniques have become more common with good outcomes.
 For a small asymptomatic pseudoaneurysm (less than 2cm), an appropriate first step
would be observation and repeat duplex ultrasound in about one month.
 For a persistent pseudoaneurysm after one month, a larger/loculated asymptomatic pseudoaneurysm, or a pseudoaneurysm that presents with minor pain at the site, minimally
invasive intervention with ultrasound guided compression or ultrasound guided thrombin
injection is appropriate.
 For any pseudoaneurysm presenting with persistent hemodynamic instability, limb ischemia, skin necrosis, AV fistula, nerve compression, expanding hematoma, an urgent
operation is required.
 Urgent open repair generally consists of gaining proximal and distal control and then
primary repair of the arterial defect.
 Urgent endovascular management may also be entailed by deploying coils in the sac and
placing a covered stent in the femoral artery, therefore thrombosing the pseudoaneurysm.

202

[Kassem et al. (2013)](Kassem and Elmahdy 2014)(Tulla, Kowalski, and Qaja 2024)
Retroperitoneal Hematoma
A retroperitoneal hematoma is a collection of blood accumulating in the retroperitoneal space
where the external iliac artery travels.
Key points:
 It is a rare complication occurring in about 0.5% of cases.
 Retroperitonaly hematomas are a dreaded complication as they comes with high morbidity and mortality especially if not rapidly diagnosed.
 Retroperitoneal hematomas occur when the arterial stick in the artery during groin
puncture is performed too high, above the level of the inferior epigastric artery.
 This leads to extravasation of blood into the retroperitoneal space after sheath removal.
 Retroperitoneal hematomas can usually can be treated with a closure device if diagnosed
intra operatively or a covered stent from the contralateral side.
Arteriovenous (AV) Fistula
An arteriovenous fistula is an aberrant connection between an artery and a vein. Although
commonly formed surgically for hemodialysis access, they can be caused iatrogenically during
arterial access for endovascular intervention.
Key points:
 They are rare and occur in less than 1% of groin access cases.
 Occur during inadvertent puncture of the deep femoral artery and deep femoral vein.
 Usually no intervention is needed.
Dissection
An arterial dissection is the separation of the layers of the arterial wall.
Key points:
 May occur naturally (often secondary to hypertension) or iatrogenically (in the setting
of arterial puncture). This most often occurs in the setting of a posteriorly lying plaque
in the artery where the wire can separate the posterior layers.
 To prevent dissection, do not apply too much forward pressure when advancing a wire
during initial arterial access. Do not inject fuid (saline or contrast) unless there is blood
return to ensure the needle or catheter tip are in the true lumen.

203

 Treatment can be conservative in the case of an iatrogenic dissection or treated with
stent placement if the dissection limits blood fow. Intravascular ultrasound can be used
to further assess the dissection.
Acute Thrombosis of Access Vessel
Acute thrombus of the access vessel is when the artery where access is obtained completely
“clots off.” It is an incredibly rare complication caused by incorrect deployment of vascular
closure devices, access site dissection, or occlusive sheath placement in a small or diseased
vessel.

Endovascular Surgical Complications
Atheroembolism
Atheroembolism is the dislodgement of a portion of a cholesterol plaque leading to distal
embolization causing acute thrombosis or partial occlusion.
Key points: (Liew and Bartholomew 2005)
 Generally, when these come from the ascending aorta or arch, they will embolize to
the cerebral and retinal vessels. On the other hand, when an embolus originates in the
thoracic or descending aorta, it will likely embolize to the mesenteric, renal or lower
extremity vessels.
 These emboli will then cause a further infammatory response worsening outcomes.
 Outcomes are dependent on volume and size of emboli and can range from sub-clinical
to fatal.
 Embolization is most common to the skin, kidneys, and GI tract though it is dependent
on the site of the procedure.
 Unfortunately this condition is generally under diagnosed and challenging to treat. Primary prevention is of utmost importance with good surgical technique.
Wire Perforation
Wire perforation occurs when an angiographic wire creates a hole in a vessel.
Key points:
 Incredibly rare but treatable when diagnosed rapidly.
 Occurs when a large stiff hydrophilic wire is passed through a small vessel especially if
not done under fuoroscopic guidance.
 Treatment involves transcatheter embolization of the perforation site.

204

Vessel Rupture
Vessel rupture occurs when a device or balloon is oversized for a vessel and causes a “blowout”
of a vessel.
Key points:
 Rupture can be cause by an oversized balloon or balloon expandable stent, by expanding
a properly sized balloon in a heavily calcified vessel or by passage of a large device such
as an EVAR device through a small vessel.
 Rupture is associated with a high morbidity and mortality especially if there is any delay
in diagnosis.
 Immediately upon recognition of vessel rupture, a balloon should be infated in the
region to obtain adequate hemostasis. Simultaneously, supplies should be can gathered
for vessel repair.
 Repair is usually done with a covered stent placed across the rupture. If adequate
hemostasis cannot be obtained, open repair may be necessary.

Teaching Case
Scenario
A 71 year old male with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary
artery disease with stent placement was diagnosed with acute type B aortic dissection three
weeks ago. He was managed medically in the hospital and sent home after one week with
blood pressure and pain well-controlled. An image from the CTA at time of diagnosis is seen
below:
The proximal extent of the dissection was 3 cm distal to the left subclavian artery and the distal
extent was 2 cm superior to the celiac artery, allowing good landing zones for an endograft.
The left internal iliac artery is fully occluded, and the right internal iliac artery has roughly
50% stenosis. The left external iliac artery is heavily calcified and stenotic >50%. The right
common and external iliac artery are patent without evidence of significant atherosclerosis.
The patient is evaluated in the preoperative area prior to placement of a thoracic endograft in
the hybrid operating room.

Note
By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

Recognize the fundamental types of ionizing radiation.
Understand the sources of radiation in the vascular operating room.
Recognize and practice radiation safety measures.
Recognize adverse outcome of significant radiation exposure.

Key Facts
1. The primary forms of ionizing radiation are alpha particles, beta particles, gamma
rays, and x-rays.
2. In the operating environment, x-rays scatter leading to potential unexpected
exposure.
3. Lead aprons and glasses are important in protecting radiosensitive organs in the
body.
4. Proper shielding, minimizing duration of radiation use, and increasing distance from
the source are important measures to reducing the amount of radiation exposure.
5. The side effects of prolonged radiation exposure to healthcare providers include
various health issues such as cataracts and reproductive dysfunction.

discussion. Do not fret if you have diﬀculty answering the questions before reading the
chapter! By the end of the chapter, we are certain you will have covered the knowledge
necessary to answer the questions. There will be a teaching case at the end of the chapter.
This is another opportunity to exercise your new knowledge!

Pre/Post Questions
Case Based Questions
1. A 45 year old vascular surgeon with 10 years of professional practice is preparing to
perform a left upper extremity fistulogram due to concerns for prolonged bleeding after
hemodialysis. What is the most appropriate PPE that the student should wear during
the case?
A. Full leaded face shield, lead apron, and personal radiation badge
B. Lead apron alone
C. Leaded safety glasses
D. Lower half of a 2-piece lead apron and thyroid shield
E. Lead apron, leaded safety glasses
Answer
A. Full leaded face shield, lead apron, and personal radiation badge
Discussion: The most appropriate PPE includes a full leaded face shield, lead apron,
and radiation badge making answer a the correct answer. This will provide the most
significant protection to the head and neck as well as vital organs of the body during
the procedure. The radiation badge will help with long-term protection as it allows
for cumulative tracking of exposure. A lead apron alone and or lead glasses alone is
inadequate for optimal protection making answers b, c, and d incorrect. A full-face
shield will be of greater protection than glasses which makes answer e incorrect.
2. A 25 year old medical student has been invited to observe endovascular stent placement
for an infrarenal AAA. In addition to wearing appropriate PPE, what can the medical
student do to reduce their exposure during the case?
A. Stand as close to the radiation source as possible.
B. Turn their back to the radiation source.

211

C. Stand as far from the radiation source as possible.
D. Wear a radiation badge.
Answer
C. Stand as far from the radiation source as possible.
Discussion: Increasing one’s distance from the radiation source is a key measure to to
reduce radiation exposure. Radiation exposure decreases as the distance from the source
increases. This phenomenon follows an inverse square law (1/d^2). Standing close to
the source will increase their radiation dose making answer a incorrect. If wearing a lead
smock, turning one’s back to the radiation source will render the PPE useless. If wearing
a leaded vest and skirt, turning one’s back has no effect. Wearing a radiation badge is
beneficial for long-term monitoring of radiation exposure but does not affect the amount
of radiation exposure.
3. A 55 year old vascular surgeon who has been practicing for 20 years has noticed some
subtle changes in his vision. What is the most likely underlying disease process?
A. Optical neuropathy
B. Glaucoma
C. Opacification of the lens
D. Retinal angiopathy
Answer
C. Opacification of the lens
Discussion: The lens is the most radiosensitive componenet of the eye. Lens opacification
(i.e. cataracts) is the most common adverse effect of radiation exposure to the eye. There
was no mention of increased intraocular pressure or abnormal fundoscopic exam making
answers a, b, and d incorrect.
4. A 65 year old female is presenting to the hospital for endovascular repair of a complicated
AAA. There is prolonged radiation time with a calculated absorbed dose of 3.5 Gy. What
is the most likely skin exam finding during the patient’s hospital course?
A. Skin necrosis
B. Burn
C. No acute findings as the dose were too low
D. Erythema

212

Answer
D. Erythema
Discussion: With a dose of 3.5 Gy, the most likely result will be transient erythema
between 2 to 24 hours from exposure. This can be found in table 2. Skin necrosis can
occur, but it would need much higher doses making answer a wrong. It would be incorrect
to say the dose is too low as 3.5 Gy making answer c invalid, and also below the threshold
to cause a burn making answer b incorrect as well.
5. A 42 year old male on hemodialysis from a left upper extremity brachiocephalic fistula
for CKD is seen for a fistulogram due the patient having trouble pulling during dialysis.
The patient is placed in the supine position with left arm extended. The c-arm is initially
perpendicular to the operating table. To achieve better views of the proximal vessels,
the c-arm is rotated counterclockwise (from the perspective of looking from the patient’s
feet superiorly) so that the image intensifier is rotated more towards the patient’s right
shoulder. What is the appropriate name for the c-arm position?
A. LAO (left anterior oblique)
B. RAO (right anterior oblique)
C. Cranial
D. Caudal
E. AP (anterior posterior)
Answer
B. RAO (right anterior oblique)
Discussion: When the image intensifier is rotated more towards the right shoulder, this
is the RAO position making answer a correct. If the c-arm were rotated clockwise, with
the c-arm over the left shoulder, this would be the LAO position. As no mention was
made of rotating the c-arm towards the head or foot of the bed, answers c and d are
incorrect. The AP position was the initial position of the c-arm when it is perpendicular
to the OR table.
6. A 27 year old female who is a circulating nurse in the endovascular suite recently became
pregnant. She has informed the radiation safety oﬀcer and staff of the endovascular
suite. She is curious how best to monitor the radiation dose the fetus is receiving in
utero. Where should the nurse place the fetal dosimetry badge?
A. The dosimetry badge should be worn on the outside of the lead apron at chest level
B. The dosimetry badge should be worn under the lead apron around chest

213

C. The dosimetry badge should be worn outside the lead apron at the abdomen level.
D. The dosimetry badge should be worn under the lead apron at the abdomen level.
Answer
D. The dosimetry badge should be worn under the lead apron at the abdomen
level.
Discussion: To monitor the dose to the unborn child, the dosimeter badge should be worn
under the lead at the abdomen level, making answer d correct. We are concerned with the
amount of radiation that is able to pass through proper PPE. Wearing the badge outside
the lead apron will indicate the amount of radiation exposure in front of the shielding
and not an approximate fetal dose making answers a and c incorrect. If the badge is
worn at the level of the chest, the dose will also not be the most accurate, making answer
b incorrect.

Introduction
The use of radiation is fundamental to a vascular surgeon’s practice. Intraoperative fuoroscopy,
computer tomography (CT), and plain film X-rays (to a lesser extent) are crucial tools in
vascular surgery. The vascular surgery patient will likely undergo all these radiation-based
imaging studies.
Vascular surgeons and other professionals (nurses, scrub technicians, imaging technicians, etc.)
can be exposed to significant levels of radiation over a career of performing intraoperative
fuoroscopy/angiography and endovascular surgery. As the medical community is well aware
of these risks, many initiatives are underway to decrease the amount of radiation required to
perform studies and interventions.
Vascular patients are also exposed to radiation, although often at higher doses over shorter
periods of time. Educating oneself about radiation and radiation safety is essential. This
chapter will explore the basics of radiation, radiation safety principles and measures, and
potential adverse outcomes of significant radiation exposure.

214

Radiation Penetrance
A critical concept to understand when discussing occupational and patient exposure to radiation is penetrance.
 Penetrance refers to the ability of emitted radiation to penetrate into or through materials and is defined as the fraction of radiation passing through a given object (or the
inverse of attenuation).
 The density of materials or tissues determines their ability to attenuate or block
X-rays.
 Dense tissues (bone) or materials (lead) absorb a greater fraction of radiation while less
dense tissues (skin) or materials (water) allow for deeper penetration.
This concept is especially relevant to vascular surgeons and their patients as an increasing
proportion of vascular procedures are performed endovascularly under live fuoroscopy which
utilizes X-rays.

Figure 1: Penetrating power of different types of radiation - alpha, beta, gamma and neutrons
courtesty of Openclipart and Juhele. X-rays have similar penetrance to gamma rays.

Radiation types
Radiation can be broadly categorized into ionizing and non-ionizing forms. This chapter will
focus on ionizing radiation, which is encountered by medical professionals in clinical settings.
Ionizing radiation falls within the higher frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The
commonly discussed types of ionizing radiation include X-rays, alpha particles, beta particles,
gamma rays.

215

Alpha Particles
Alpha particles, despite their high energy, have poor penetrance. As such, they do not penetrate the skin. However, they can be dangerous if inhaled or ingested.

Beta Particles
Beta particles, have slightly more penetration than alpha particles.
They have some ability to penetrate the skin. However, they can be easily blocked by less
dense shielding like aluminum.
Similar to alpha particles, beta particles can also cause harm if ingested or inhaled.

Gamma Rays
Gamma rays possess significantly more energy and can penetrate through the human body
and less dense shielding.
Lead is effective in shielding against gamma rays due to its density. Dense materials
increase the likelihood of radiation interacting with subatomic particles, reducing the rays’
passage through the material.
As gamma rays pass through the body, they cause ionizing damage to tissue and DNA and
should be treated with caution.

X-Rays
X-rays, widely used in healthcare, share similarities with gamma rays in their ability to penetrate tissue.
Their application in medical imaging includes plain X-ray films, CT scans, and fuoroscopy.
Lead is effective in shielding against x-rays due to its density.
The position of the x-ray emitting source of the the C-arm used for endovascular procedures
is at the bottom of the arm, beneath the patient and the operating room table. This is the
location of highest exposure.
As the X-ray source emits radiation, radiation scatter occurs, moving upward and outward
from the source.

216

Terminology
It is imporant to understanding the terminology related to radiation exposure.
 The absorbed dose refers to the energy from ionizing radiation per unit mass of exposed
material, measured in grays (Gy).
 The equivalent dose represents the mean absorbed dose of a specific organ or tissue,
measured in sieverts (Sv).
 The effective dose, also measured in *8sieverts (Sv),** accounts for total-body radiation
exposure and is guided by the International Commission on Radiological Protection
(ICRP) guidelines for comparing radiation effects on individuals.
X-ray technology for imaging comprises two critical components: the radiation source, where
X-ray photons are generated, and the detector.
 The shape of the beam from the source is managed by the collimator.
 As X-ray beam passes through the patient, they are captured by the detector and an
image is created by image intensifier.
In endovascular procedures using a C-arm, the detector portion (i.e. image intensifier) is above
the patient, while the X-ray source is beneath the patient and table.

Principles for Patient Safety and Radiation Exposure
While any procedure that produces ionizing radiation will expose the patient to some degree
of risk, it is the responsibility of the patient’s surgeon to ensure that the risk of the procedure
is minimized as much as possible without compromising the eﬀcacy of the therapy.
Certain considerations exist for special patient populations including pregnant patients. These
are discussed later in this chapter.
A number of core principles should be considered whenever a provider is considering recommending or performing a treatment with ionizing radiation including:

Medical Necessity and Justication for the Procedure
The potential benefits of the procedure should outweigh the risks of not performing the procedure or performing an alternative procedure without radiation exposure.

217

Exposure Optimization
The radiation dose delivered, particularly for intraoperative exposures, should be optimized
to be as low as possible while still achieving adequate image quality for the procedure and
decision making.
This includes fuoroscopy techniques such as reducing the time under fuoroscopy by using
pulsed fuoroscopy as opposed to continuous scanning, collimating the X-ray beam to
the area of interest and narrowing the beam to only scan structures necessary, adjusting
the frame rate of fuoroscopy images when temporal resolution is not necessary.
It also includes effective preoperative planning, including properly positioning the patient
for optimal imaging to reduce repeated attempts, and planning with previous imaging to ensure
good understanding of the vascular anatomy and to form a procedural plan prior to exposing
the patient to additional radiation.

The ALARA Principles
ALARA stands for “As Low As Reasonably Possible,” and refers to the balance between
minimizing radiation exposure to the patient without compromising the quality of care.
The energy of the X-rays: Higher energy X-rays will have greater penetrance and pass
through thicker and deeper tissue more easily. Energy is typically adjusted during the procedure to optimize for the depth of the structures being imaged.
The duration of exposure: The dose of radiation delivered to the patient and the OR staff
is directly correlated with the duration of exposure. This is why vascular surgeons try to limit
the amount of time under fuoroscopy to the minimum required.
The distance from the source: The intensity of radiation exposure decreases with distance
from the emitting source in an inverse square relationship. The patient and surgeons at bedside
and closest to the C-arm, therefore, receive significantly greater doses of radiation as compared
to OR staff further away.

Patient Education and Informed Consent:
Patients should be informed about the risks of exposure to ionizing radiation, the benefits of
the procedure, and the efforts made to reduce total dosage.
Patients should provide informed consent before any intervention whenever possible, and
should be encouraged to ask questions and voice concerns prior to the initiation of treatment.


Patient monitoring and dose recording:
During fuoroscopy-guided procedures, patient radiation doses should be monitored and
recorded accurately to help understand the patient’s cumulative radiation exposure.
In a hybrid OR, the total radiation is recorded on the large screen. If not, you can always ask
the hybrid room technician.

Radiation shielding:
The use of personal protective devices made of dense materials, such as lead aprons, thyroid
collars, and other protective shields, serve to attenuate radiation.

Shielding
Shielding serves to protect vital organs from radiation exposure and damage. The most common type of shielding is lead, typically in the form of a skirt, vest, and thyroid shield worn
beneath the surgical gown.
Lead aprons and other lead-lined materials are highly effective in protecting personnel from
radiation exposure. Lead, being a very dense material, absorbs a significant portion of the
radiation from X-ray beams that would otherwise reach the person wearing it. These lead
protection devices are specifically designed to safeguard vital organs and those most sensitive
to radiation exposure—such as organs not shielded by overlying bone. This includes the torso,
reproductive organs, and the thyroid gland.

Reported effectiveness of worn lead varies. Some sources claim that a lead apron with a
thickness of 0.5 mm can reduce radiation scatter by 90%, while others suggest a lesser reduction.
However, there is a consensus that the apron should be at least 0.25 mm thick both in the
front and back. (Cheon et al. 2018)
Additional shielding such as lead screens can be found in the OR to provide further protection
against scattered X-rays.

Radiation Badges
Radiation badges or “dosimeters” are personal wearable devices designed to measure the
amount of radiation exposure an individual receives. They measure the total exposure accumulated over a set period of time. It’s important to note that these devices specifically
measure ionizing radiation and not other forms.
There are several types of badges available. Film badges are commonly used in clinical practice.
They are worn by a single person and are evaluated every 30 days. Other types of badges
provide real-time quantification of radiation exposure, with readings recorded at the beginning
and end of each shift. A radiation oﬀcer is typically tasked with tracking these exposure
levels.
Ĺ Note
Please find more information about radiation badges here:
When an individual’s exposure approaches a certain threshold, which is typically set below
the maximum allowable dose for a year, measures are taken to further minimize their exposure. For instance, if an employee has reached a significant exposure level two months into the
year, the radiation compliance oﬀcer would discuss strategies to reduce their exposure. Strategies include maintaining greater distance from radiation sources, rotating through cases more
frequently, and avoiding involvement in procedures with a higher risk of elevated radiation
levels.
If an employee surpasses their annual exposure limits, they are typically prohibited from
participating in procedures involving radiation for the remainder of the year. The specific
limits of exposure are detailed later in the chapter.

220

Lead Glasses and Eye Protection
In the endovascular suite, it’s common to see individuals wearing leaded glasses. A 2016 study
compared different types of glasses and their effectiveness in reducing radiation exposure. The
results showed that all leaded glasses outperformed non-leaded safety glasses, with an average
reduction in dose of approximately 90.3%. (Waddell et al. 2016) This study is just one of
many that highlight the eﬀcacy of lead glasses in minimizing eye exposure during procedures
involving radiation.
Despite the significant reduction achieved with the use of lead safety glasses, there’s a caveat
regarding a false sense of security. Due to the scattering of radiation during procedures, the
eye can be exposed to radiation at oblique angles (i.e. around the glasses), leading to increased
exposure and limited reduction in dose. (Kirkwood et al. 2020) In such scenarios, the optimal
solution for reducing eye exposure would be a full visor or face shield with lateral eye
shielding. A study by Samara et al. demonstrated that the most substantial dose reduction
was observed in the full visor group.(Samara et al. 2022)
Wearing lead safety glasses during interventions is recommended as it reduces radiation exposure and helps maintain eye health, particularly for individuals at risk of accumulating
significant lifetime radiation exposure.
Ĺ Note
Please find an examples of lead glasses here:

Imaging Technique
Now that we’ve covered both radiation equipment and safety gear, it’s crucial to underscore the
importance of imaging technique. This concept is critical because it addresses the multifaceted
aspects of minimizing radiation exposure during procedures.
The radiation dose depends on both the intensity of imaging and the duration of fuoroscopic exposure. (Rial and Vañó 2021) During endovascular procedures, the operating
surgeon can control these factors by:
1. Pulse imaging: Instead of continuously scanning the patient, the surgeon can pulsate
images (i.e. shoot several plain x-rays). This approach reduces scatter and lowers overall
exposure. It’s especially effective when high temporal resolution isn’t necessary.
2. Collimator use: The surgeon can use the collimator to narrow the X-ray beam, focusing
solely on the area of interest. This method effectively reduces both dose and scatter.

221

The image intensifier should be positioned closer to the patient to optimize image quality.
Conversely, the X-ray tube should be placed further away from the area being imaged.
If the X-ray tube is too close, imaging quality can degrade and radiation dose increases. This
strategic arrangement ensures that the image quality remains high while minimizing patient
exposure to radiation.
Ď Tip
See a visual summary of correct and incorrect technique here.
Another crucial aspect of radiation exposure is a person’s distance from the radiation
source. Radiation exposure decreases as the distance from the source increases. This phenomenon follows an inverse square law (1/d^2). (J. H. Kim 2018)
Ĺ Note
Suppose a medical student is initially one foot away from a radiation source, and their
exposure is measured at 500 mGy/min. If they then move ten feet away from the
source, their exposure would reduce significantly to 5 mGy/min. This example vividly
demonstrates why distance from the source plays a pivotal role in minimizing radiation
exposure.

If you are not scrubbed, the ideal place to stand is as far away from the x-ray source
while making sure you can still see the images and interact with the surgical team.
When discussing the positioning of the C-arm, it’s useful to become familiar with some common
terminology. To improve visualization of the target area, the C-arm can rotate left and right,
and cranially or caudally. All terminology is relative to the radiation source (under
the table) and not the intensifier (above the patient). Two frequently encountered
positions are RAO (right anterior oblique) and LAO (left anterior oblique).

Adverse Outcomes Given Prolonged Radiation Exposure
Limits
Various governing agencies in the US and around the world have established limits on yearly
radiation exposure.
Currently, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Nuclear Regulatory Commissions, and Department of Energy all stipulate a yearly limit of 5,000
mrem/year (50 Sv). [“Radiation In Perspective” (n.d.)](“Information for Radiation Workers,” n.d.)
Some agencies further specify this limit to 1,250 mrem/quarter (12.5 Sv). (“Radiation
Emergency Preparedness and Response - Response | Occupational Safety and Health Administration,” n.d.)

Deterministic versus stochastic radiation eects
Before delving into the various risks associated with radiation exposure, it’s essential to provide
a brief overview of the types of radiation effects. These effects can be broadly categorized into
deterministic and stochastic effects.
Deterministic effects, also known as non-stochastic effects, occur when specific radiation
dose thresholds are exceeded leading to adverse outcomes. They are dose-dependent and
result in significant damage, such as cell death in a specific organ. Examples of deterministic
effects include cataracts, infertility, and non-malignant skin lesions. (Weerakkody et al. 2008a)
Making sure thresholds are not surpassed is pertinent not only for individuals working in the
endovascular suite but also for ensuring patient safety.

The table above underscores a crucial consideration: deterministic effects may potentially
arise in cases with prolonged run times. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a routine
procedure for modern vascular surgeons. While the duration of these procedures may vary,
considering the cited range of radiation dosages from 0.51 to 3.74 (Weerakkody et al. 2008a),
it’s conceivable that patients could experience post-operative adverse events solely due to the
effects of radiation exposure.
In contrast, stochastic effects result from repeated exposure to radiation levels below a certain
threshold. A notable example of stochastic effects is cancer. Stochastic effects are probabilistic
in nature. For example, the likelihood of developing leukemia after a single chest X-ray is low.
However, if someone were to undergo a head-to-toe CT scan daily for a year, the probability of
developing leukemia would significantly increase, even though there isn’t a direct correlation
between the dose of radiation and the observed effect. (Hamada and Fujimichi 2014)

The Eye and Radiation Exposure:
During radiological procedures, one organ that often goes unnoticed but is significantly exposed
is the eye, specifically the lens.
The lens of the eye is particularly sensitive to radiation .
 Cataracts: Prolonged exposure to significant radiation levels can lead to opacification of the lens (i.e. cataracts)
 This gradual process ultimately results in the development of cataracts, with the most
common subtype being posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataracts. (Loganovsky et al.
2020)
 A study conducted in 2013 examined the dose-effect relationship of radiation on the eyes
of interventional cardiologists and electrophysiologists. The study found that up to 25%
of the physicians involved had exceeded current exposure thresholds and were at risk of
developing radiation-induced cataracts. (Jacob et al. 2012)
Other ocular pathologies associated with radiation exposure include:

 Cataracts: Prolonged exposure to radiation may lead to the development of cataracts,
causing clouding of the lens.
 Glaucoma: Radiation exposure can contribute to glaucoma, a condition characterized
by increased intraocular pressure.
 Optic Neuropathy: Damage to the optic nerve due to radiation exposure can result
in vision impairment.
 Retinal Angiopathy: Radiation may impact retinal blood vessels, leading to angiopathy.
 Dry Eye Syndrome: Radiation exposure can cause dryness and discomfort in the eyes.
In recent years, there has been growing research interest in understanding the potential
adverse effects of long-term radiation exposure on ocular health.
The increased understanding of these risks has prompted a greater emphasis on the importance of safety equipment to protect the eyes. Proper use of protective gear such as lead
glasses and face shields is crucial for minimizing radiation exposure to ocular tissues.

The Skin and Radiation Exposure:
Skin changes of varying severity are a well-documented adverse reaction to radiation exposure. These changes can range from mild redness and irritation to severe necrosis and the
development of secondary skin cancers. Importantly, these changes may not always manifest
immediately.
Adverse effects to the skin vary according to the cumulative dose of radiation. For example, at
the large cumulative dose of 50 Gy, fibrosis may occur, presenting as induration, skin retraction,
edema, restricted motion, ulceration, and necrosis. (Bennardo et al. 2021) This underscores
the importance of understanding a patient’s radiation exposure history, as it could increase
their susceptibility to radiation-induced injury.
The most commonly encountered adverse skin effect is acute radiation dermatitis.
 Acute radiation dermatitis characterized by redness and ulceration, can occur with relatively low doses, such as 2 Gy. [Stewart et al. (2012)](Bennardo et al. 2021)
 This level of exposure is concerning not only for individuals undergoing routine radiation therapy for cancer treatment but also for those in prolonged surgeries requiring fuoroscopy, as highlighted in Weerakkody’s study on endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).
(Weerakkody et al. 2008b)
 Symptoms of acute radiation dermatitis typically appear within 2 to 24 hours
following exposure.

 As the radiation dose increases, the severity of side effects worsens, and the time to onset
of these effects also lengthens. For instance, a single radiation dose of 10 Gy may result
in dermal atrophy, but this may not be evident until more than 10 weeks after exposure.
(Stewart et al. 2012)
This discussion doesn’t cover all possible adverse effects related to skin radiation exposure.
Rather, it provides an overview of common findings based on typical exposure scenarios in
vascular surgery patients. Further information on the effects of single and cumulative radiation
doses on the skin can be found in studies by Stewart ((Stewart et al. 2012)) and Bennardo
((Bennardo et al. 2021)), respectively.

Thyroid Dysfunction, Thyroid Cancer, and Radiation Exposure
It is widely acknowledged that radiation exposure during childhood significantly increases
the risk of developing thyroid cancer. Key risk factors in this context include both the dose
of radiation received and the age at the time of exposure.(Iglesias et al. 2017) However,
when it comes to establishing a similar relationship in adulthood, the evidence has been less
straightforward.
In October 2023, The Journal of Radiation Research published a systematic review
and meta-analysis specifically examining the incidence of thyroid cancer following
radiation exposure in adults. While some studies suggested an increased risk of cancer
in adults exposed to radiation, the relative risk at a dose of 10 mGy (milligray) was deemed
insignificant. In other words, the risk did not show a significant elevation at this particular
dose level.
While a definitive link between radiation exposure and thyroid cancer in adult populations
remains elusive, several studies have hinted at a potential association between low-dose
ionizing radiation and thyroid dysfunction.
 There have been reports of hypothyroidism marked by elevated levels of thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) and lower-than-average levels of free triiodothyronine (T3)
and thyroxine (T4) compared to unexposed individuals. (Cioﬀ et al. 2020)
Given the potential implications of radiation exposure to thyroid disfunction and cancer, additional research into the long-term effects of ionizing radiation exposure on thyroid function
is warranted. Numerous studies have emphasized the need for further investigation in this
area.

Reproductive Function and Radiation Exposure
One of the significant concerns associated with radiation exposure is its impact on reproductive
health.


In the female reproductive system, ionizing radiation primarily affects the ovaries, potentially leading to:
1. Ovarian Insuﬀciency: Prolonged exposure to radiation may result in ovarian insuﬀciency, affecting the ovaries’ ability to function optimally.
2. Delayed Puberty: Radiation exposure can also contribute to delayed puberty in females.
3. Infertility: Ultimately, these effects may culminate in infertility.
Some sources suggest that radiation to the head during routine medical procedures could
disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. (Marci et al. 2018) This disruption may lead to hormonal dysregulation, further impacting reproductive health.
Radiation exposure to male reproductive organs can disrupt spermatogenesis, depending
on the stage of sperm development. The damage from ionizing radiation may lead to decreased
sperm motility, increased fragmentation, and DNA alterations. (Wdowiak et al. 2019)

Hematologic Disease and Radiation Exposure
Prolonged low-dose radiation exposure has the potential to cause serious hematological effects. Numerous studies, including those conducted outside the medical field, have examined
hematologicaly consequences of employees at risk of radiation exposure.
A particularly noteworthy study, published in 2015, involved an international cohort of observers within the nuclear industry. Their research revealed compelling evidence linking lowdose radiation exposure to the development of non-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). (Leuraud et al. 2015)
 Specifically, the study highlighted a direct correlation between cumulative red bone
marrow dose over a two-year period and the excess relative risk of developing leukemia.
 Their findings indicated that the relative risk of leukemia mortality was approximately
2.96 per Gy of exposure (RR = 2.94 per Gy).
While we won’t delve into the intricate details of these findings in this chapter, they underscore
the critical importance of considering lifelong radiation exposure and the need for effective
protective measures.



Pregnant Populations
When it comes to radiation exposure during pregnancy, there are important guidelines
and considerations to keep in mind.
 To monitor the radiation dose absorbed by the fetus, a dosimeter or radiation badge is
typically worn under the lead apron at the level of the abdomen.
 This dosimeter is checked monthly, and the absorbed dose is calculated accordingly.
 Fetal Harm Threshold: Ensure that the radiation dose does not exceed 0.5 mSv per
month or a maximum fetal dose of 5 mSv throughout the entire pregnancy


Lead Thickness Considerations for Pregnant Providers:
 Minimum Thickness: Pregnant individuals should wear a lead apron with a minimum
thickness of 0.5 mm. This ensures proper coverage of the abdomen, shielding the fetus
from radiation exposure.
 Double-Thickness Option: Alternatively, a double-thickness lead apron (1.0 mm) can
be worn. According to Vu et al. ((Elder and Vu 2013)), this reduces the absorbed dose
from 9 mrem to 3 mrem.
 Weight Consideration: However, it’s essential to recognize that wearing a thicker
lead apron may increase the risk of back injury due to the added weight. Balancing
protection and comfort is crucial.
As always, healthcare providers should adhere to the ALARA principles outlined above
(i.e. maintaining a maximum reasonable distance from the source, using the collimator, pulse
imaging, etc.).


Teaching Case
Scenario
A 75-year-old male is scheduled for an angiogram of the left lower extremity to investigate and
potentially treat claudication symptoms. The attending vascular surgeon, with over 25 years
of experience in endovascular therapy, takes precautionary measures by wearing a thyroid
shield, prescription glasses, and a 2-piece lead apron. However, due to challenges in navigating the stenosed arterial system, the fuoroscopy time during the procedure was extended.
Subsequently, the calculated radiation dose amounted to 3 Gy.
