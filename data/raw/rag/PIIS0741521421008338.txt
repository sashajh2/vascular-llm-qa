ABSTRACT
Objective: To summarize the best available evidence comparing open vs endovascular popliteal artery aneurysm (PAA)
repair. We also summarized the natural history of PAAs to support of the Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines.
Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane databases, and Scopus for studies of patients with PAAs treated
with an open vs an endovascular approach. We also included studies of natural history of untreated patients. Studies
were selected and appraised by pairs of independent reviewers. A meta-analysis was performed when appropriate.
Results: We identiﬁed 32 original studies and 4 systematic reviews from 2191 candidate references. Meta-analysis showed
that compared with the endovascular approach, open surgical repair was associated with higher primary patency at 1 year
(odds ratio [OR], 2.10; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 1.41-3.12), lower occlusion rate at 30 days (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.24-0.68) and
fewer reinterventions (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.17-0.45), but a longer hospital stay (standardized mean difference, 2.16; 95% CI,
1.23-3.09) and more wound complications (OR, 5.18; 95% CI, 2.19-12.26). There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in
primary patency at 3 years (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.97-1.97), secondary patency (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.84-3.03), mortality at the
longest follow-up (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.21-1.17), mortality at 30 days (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.06-1.36), or amputation (incidence rate
ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.56-1.31). The certainty in these estimates was, in general, low. Studies of PAA natural history suggest that
thromboembolic complications and amputation develop at a mean observation time of 18 months and they are frequent.
One study showed that at 5 years, approximately one-half of the patients had complications.
Conclusions: This systematic review provides event rates for outcomes important to patients with PAAs. Despite the low
certainty of the evidence, these rates along with surgical expertise and anatomic feasibility can help patients and
surgeons to engage in shared decision-making. (J Vasc Surg 2022;75:121S-5S.)

Although peripheral artery aneurysms are rare, popliteal
artery aneurysms (PAAs) are the most common type of
peripheral arterial aneurysm with a reported prevalence
rate of 0.007% in men, and 0.001% in women. Patients
with PAAs are at increased risk of concomitant abdominal
aortic aneurysms (33%) and contralateral PAA disease
(50%).1,2 Given the anatomic location of the popliteal
artery, untreated aneurysmal disease of this artery can
lead to complications, including limb loss.
Treatments of PAAs can be performed using endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) or open aneurysm repair

(OAR). OAR typically involves bypass around the aneurysm, aneurysm ligation or aneurysmorhaphy. EVAR involves placing a stent graft across the aneurysm.
Thrombolysis is an adjunct treatment used with both
therapeutic strategies if acute limb ischemia is present.
Although endovascular repair is less invasive than surgical bypass, its durability has been questioned. Therefore,
empirical evidence comparing the long-term outcomes
of OAR with EVAR remains unclear. Consequently, there
is equipoise and a lack of consensus about the comparative effectiveness of either approach in managing PAAs.
The Society for Vascular Surgery has convened a committee of experts to develop clinical practice guidelines
on the management of PAAs.3 To support these
guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and
meta-analysis to summarize the best available evidence
comparing the efﬁcacy of OAR with EVAR in the
treatment of PAAs, as well as the natural history of PAAs.

Study eligibility data sources and search strategies.
We included studies with 10 patients or more that
reported outcomes of patients with PAAs treated with
open or endovascular approaches. Studies had to be
comparative with longitudinal follow up and evaluate an
outcome of interest (mortality, amputation, need of reintervention, thromboembolic events, patency, length of
hospital stay or surgical complications). Traumatic and iatrogenic aneurysms were excluded. We also included
studies that reported the rate of complications without
treatment (ie, natural history studies). Because some
studies reported results per aneurysms and not per patients and to present evidence on all outcomes, we summarized data from several selected existing systematic
reviews. Supplementary Table I (online only) includes
details of the two clinical questions in the patients, intervention, comparison, outcomes (PICO) format.
A comprehensive search of several databases from database inception to June 15th, 2018 was conducted without
language restrictions. The databases included MEDLINE
Epub Ahead of Print, Medline In-Process & Other NonIndexed Citations, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. The search strategy was
designed and conducted by a medical reference librarian
with input from the investigators. Controlled vocabulary
supplemented with keywords was used to search for
studies of open or endovascular repair of PAAs. The actual
strategy is available in the Appendix (online only).
Study selection, data extraction, and methodologic
quality assessment. Studies were selected and data
were extracted by pairs of independent reviewers. Data
extracted included patient and setting description, procedure description, risk of bias indicators and outcome
data. Because the studies were nonrandomized, we
used the Newcastle Ottawa tool5 to assess the risk of
bias. This tool evaluates three main domains: cohort
selection, comparability, and outcome assessment. We
did not calculate a score; rather, we made a global
judgment about the risk of bias in each study.6
Statistical analysis and certainty in evidence. We
calculated the odds ratio (OR) with 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) for primary and secondary outcomes, as well as
determined an incidence rate ratio for amputations
across the studies. Thus, the OR of a bad outcome (amputation) in which the intervention reduces the outcome
would be less than one and for a beneﬁcial intervention
(patency) would be greater than one. Because of anticipated heterogeneity, the DerSimonian and Laird random
effects model7 was used to pool estimates from the
included studies. The I2 statistic was used to estimate
heterogeneity. Analysis was done using R Statistical
Computing software version 4.0.0 (The R Foundation,
Vienna, Austria). Data were insufﬁcient to conduct

Type of Research: Systematic review and metaanalysis to support Society for Vascular Surgery
guideline.
Key Findings: This meta-analysis provides event rates
for patient important outcomes after treatment of
popliteal artery aneurysms.
Take Home Message: The open approach for treating
popliteal artery aneurysms is associated with higher primary patency and lower short-term occlusion, but
longer hospital stay and more wound complications.
There was no signiﬁcant difference in mortality or
amputation rate between open and endovascular
approaches.

preplanned subgroup analyses (aneurysm size, extension
to superﬁcial femoral artery, and concomitant aneurysms).
We used the GRADE approach to evaluate certainty in the
evidence (also called quality of evidence).8 In this approach,
randomized trials start at high level of certainty and observational studies start at low level of certainty. Certainty can
be graded down owing to study limitations, imprecision,
indirectness, inconsistency, or publication bias. Certainty
can also be increased, for example, for a large effect size.9

RESULTS
Included studies. We identiﬁed 32 original studies in 33
publications10-42 and 4 systematic reviews1,43-45 from 2191
candidate references. The Fig depicts the process of
study selection. Thirty original studies in 31
publications10-20,22-34,36-42 were included in the quantitative synthesis comparing OAR and EVAR. These
studies included 5381 patients with mean age range of
63 to 68 years; 91.6% of patients were male (descriptive
data are from studies that reported outcomes per
patient, not per aneurysm). All studies were nonrandomized,11-20,22-34,36-42 except for one randomized
trial.10 Supplementary Table II (online only) includes the
characteristics

studies.
Supplementary Table III (online only) includes the evaluation of the risk of bias of these studies. We also identiﬁed three systematic reviews that reported the
outcomes of reintervention rate, wound complications,
and hospital length of stay.43-45 These analyses were
deemed adequate and the most recent dataset43 was
used to extract these outcomes (14 studies, 4880
aneurysms). In terms of natural history outcomes, we
identiﬁed an existing systematic review of 13 surgical
case series (437 aneurysms)1 and 2 additional series with
additional 399 aneurysms.21,35

2.10; 95% CI, 1.41-3.12). There was no statistically signiﬁcant
difference in primary patency at 3 years, secondary patency,
mortality, or the amputation rate. The open approach was
associated with lower embolic and thrombotic occlusions
at 30 days (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.24, 0.68). Forest plots are in
Supplementary Figs 1 and 2 (online only).
Data from the systematic reviews identiﬁed in the
search have shown that OAR was associated with lower
reintervention rate (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.17-0.45) more
wound complications (OR, 5.18; 95% CI, 2.19-12.26), and
longer length of stay, standardized mean difference of
2.16 (95% CI, 1.23-3.09).43
Studies of natural history. Studies of natural history
suggested that complications of popliteal aneurysms
develop at a mean observation time of 18 months.1 The
incidence of thromboembolic complications ranged
from 8% TO 100% across series and that in patients with
complications, amputation rate was 25%.1 In one series
with a longer follow-up, only 53% of patients treated
conservatively were free of complications at 5 years.35 In a
second case series, 36% of asymptomatic patients had
complications at 26 months.21
Certainty in estimates and publication bias. The risk of
bias was in general high across studies owing to a lack of
adjustment for prognostic risk factors. The certainty in
the comparative estimates was low owing to the observational nature of the studies and the small sample sizes.
Although we were unable to evaluate statistically for
publication bias, this type of bias is likely present in a
body of evidence that consists of smaller series that do
not require registration. It is plausible that published
results are more favorable than unpublished ones.

DISCUSSION
Main ﬁndings. We conducted a systematic review and
meta-analysis to support the Society for Vascular Surgery guideline on the management of PAAs. A metaanalysis showed that, compared with the endovascular
approach, the open surgical approach was associated
with higher primary patency at 1 year, lower embolic and
thrombotic occlusions at 30 days, and lower reintervention rates, but more wound complications and longer
lengths of stay. There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in secondary patency, mortality, or amputation
rate. Our ﬁndings were comparable with previous literature.43 However, in contrast with Leake et al,43 our results
do not favor OAR over EVAR in terms of primary patency
at 3 years because no statistically signiﬁcant difference
between the two modalities was found. Our review of the
natural history of PAAS is consistent with the existing
literature in demonstrating sparse data and low
certainty. Studies of PAAs natural history suggested that
thromboembolic
complications
and
amputation
develop at a mean observation time of 18 months and
they are frequent. At 5 years, approximately one-half of
the patients had complications.
Implications. These ﬁndings suggest that open PAA
repair may be more durable than endovascular repair,
albeit with a higher risk of complications and resource
use. These data need to be taken in context, because
they have not been validated by a well-powered randomized trial comparing these two treatment strategies.
As such, depending on patient comorbidities and
anatomic factors such as the presence of an optimal
conduit, both OAR and EVAR remain important tools in

the management of patients with PAAs. A systematic
review of the natural history data of asymptomatic PAAs
suggests that PAAs present a signiﬁcant risk of thromboembolic complications that may lead to limb loss.
Therefore, consideration of an appropriately timed
intervention to treat such aneurysms is an important
strategy.
Strengths and limitations. The current systematic review followed a rigorous approach, including searching
multiple databases, reviewing the literature by independent pairs of reviewers, and collaboration with content
experts from the Society for Vascular Surgery.
A clear limitation in this body of evidence is the small
sample size of series of a rare condition.
The lack of anatomic variables to allow patient selection
for the endovascular approach is another major limitation.
A planned subgroup analyses were not feasible owing to
the lack of available information. Particularly, we were unable to stratify the analysis comparing emergent from
elective cases as this distinction was not explicitly made
in many of the published series. Similarly, data on other
patient important outcomes such as acute limb ischemia,
late conversion from endovascular to open repair, and
quality of life were insufﬁcient to estimate a treatment
effect. Randomized trials of treatments of PAAS are challenging. Future research efforts could focus on establishing rigorous multicenter registries that document the
clinical and anatomic presentations, treatment choices
and outcomes of PAAs.
