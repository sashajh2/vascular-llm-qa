ABSTRACT
Background: Several diagnostic tests and treatment options for patients with lower extremity varicose veins have existed
for decades. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the latest evidence to support the forthcoming
updates of the clinical practice guidelines on the management of varicose veins for the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS),
the American Venous Forum (AVF) and the American Vein and Lymphatic Society.
Methods: We searched multiple databases for studies that addressed four clinical questions identiﬁed by the AVF and
the SVS guideline committee about evaluating and treating patients with varicose veins. Studies were selected and
appraised by pairs of independent reviewers. A meta-analysis was conducted when feasible.
Results: We included 73 original studies (45 were randomized controlled trials) and 1 systematic review from 12,915
candidate references. Moderate certainty of evidence supported the usefulness of duplex ultrasound (DUS) examination as
the gold standard test for diagnosing saphenous vein incompetence in patients with varicose veins and chronic venous
insufﬁciency (clinical, etiological, anatomic, pathophysiological classiﬁcation [CEAP] class C2-C6). High ligation and stripping (HL/S) was associated with higher anatomic closure rates at 30 days and 5 years when compared with radiofrequency
ablation and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) (moderate certainty), while no signiﬁcant difference was seen
when compared with endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) at 5 years. UGFS was associated with an increased risk of recurrence
compared with HL/S. EVLA was associated with lower anatomic closure rates at 30 days than cyanoacrylate closure (CAC)
and higher rates at one and 5 years when compared with UGFS. Thermal interventions were associated with lower generic
quality of life scores and an increased risk of adverse events when compared with CAC or n-butyl cyanoacrylate (low certainty). Thermal interventions were associated with a lower risk of recurrent incompetence when compared with UGFS and
an increased risk of recurrent incompetence than CAC. The evidence for great saphenous vein ablation alone to manage
perforator disease was inconclusive.
Conclusions: The current systematic review summarizes the evidence to develop and support forthcoming updated SVS/
AVF/American Vein and Lymphatic Society clinical practice guideline recommendations. The evidence supports duplex
scanning for evaluating patients with varicose veins and conﬁrms that HL/S resulted in similar long-term saphenous vein
closure rates as EVLA and in better rates than radiofrequency ablation and UGFS. Thermal interventions were associated
with inferior generic quality of life scores than nonthermal interventions, but had a lower risk of recurrent incompetence
than UGFS. The recommendations in the guidelines should consider this information as well as other factors such as
patients’ values and preferences, anatomic considerations of individual patients, and surgical expertise. (J Vasc Surg

reduction in quality of life (QoL) and associated disease
burden and work productivity loss.3-6 In 2014, the annualized US payer disease burden for venous leg ulcers was
estimated to be around US$15 billion, and the overall
treatment cost for varicose veins is projected to reach
US$8 trillion by 2021.2,4,7,8 The disease prevalence is also
expected to increase owing to the obesity pandemic
and an aging population.
Several diagnostic and treatment modalities have been
implemented over many years, including conservative
therapy, open surgical interventions, and endovenous
ablation.9,10 Several studies have compared conservative
vs interventional management options.9-11 However,
the comparative effectiveness of the different interventional treatment options, including open surgical
therapy,
thermal
and
nonthermal
endovenous
ablation, and sclerotherapy among each other, remains
controversial.11-14
In 2011, the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) partnered
with the American Venous Forum (AVF) to develop clinical practice guidelines to improve the care of patients
with chronic venous disease.9 Since the release of the
2011 guideline, additional studies and systematic reviews
have been published.11-14 The SVS and the AVF along with
the American Vein and Lymphatic Society have, therefore, determined there is currently a need to update
the guidelines on the management of chronic venous
disease and the supporting evidence for the guidelines.
The purpose of this analysis is to provide information
pertinent to updating the guidelines speciﬁcally with
regard to management of varicose veins.

METHODS
This systematic review follows an a priori protocol
developed by a committee from the SVS and AVF
responsible for developing clinical practice guidelines
on the management of varicose veins. This report
complies with the PRISMA statements.15
Eligibility criteria. The committee prioritized four key
questions presented using the PICO format (patient,
intervention, comparison, outcomes) accompanied by
the eligibility criteria in Table I.
The four questions addressed the following: Question 1,
The diagnostic usefulness of DUS in adults with varicose
veins (C2-C6); question 2, surgical stripping vs any
endovenous ablation technique in patients who have
identiﬁed varicose vein and axial saphenous vein incompetence; question 3, thermal vs nonthermal technique
outcomes in patients with varicose veins who underwent
endovenous ablation treatment of an incompetent
superﬁcial axial saphenous vein; and question 4, outcomes of incompetent perforator veins ablation vs no
perforator ablation in patients with simple varicose veins
(clinical, etiological, anatomic, pathophysiological

classiﬁcation [CEAP] class C2) with or without axial superﬁcial saphenous or other truncal (axial) vein ablation.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and
comparative observational studies that enrolled at least
10 adult patients (aged $18 years) with primary varicose
veins (CEAP class 2-6).16 We included diagnostic studies
where patients were evaluated for GSV incompetence using DUS compared with other diagnostic test modalities
such as physical examination, complemented by plethysmography, computed tomography scan or MR imaging,
venogram, and hand-held Doppler (HHD). We also studied treatment modalities separately in patients with varicose veins (CEAP class 2-6) and compared the outcomes
of different procedures. The procedures included open
surgery (high ligation and stripping [HL/S], saphenectomy,
or conventional surgery), endovenous ablation techniques
including thermal ablation with endovenous laser therapy
(EVLT) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and nonthermal
ablations, including cyanoacrylate closure (CAC), mechanochemical ablation (MOCA), ultrasound-guided foam
sclerotherapy (UGFS), physician compounded foam
sclerotherapy, or commercially produced foam sclerotherapy. We also studied patients (only CEAP class C2)
who underwent ablation of incompetent perforating
veins. We included studies that enrolled at least 85% of
the population of interest (ie, if 85% of the population of
the study ﬁts the question of the systematic review, for
example, they had C2-C6 varicose veins, we included
such study).
We included studies that measured outcomes of superﬁcial axial vein incompetence (retrograde ﬂow in the GSV
of >500 ms), pain, generic and disease-speciﬁc QoL,
neurologic complications, anatomic closure, recurrent
varicosity, recurrent incompetence, patient satisfaction,
and procedure-related adverse events (AEs), including
serious AEs including death, pulmonary embolism,
deep vein thrombosis (DVT), myocardial infarction,
stroke, transient ischemic attack, visual symptoms,
generalized allergy, anaphylaxis, hemorrhage requiring
transfusion or surgery, severe pain, severe neuralgia,
endovenous heat-induced thrombosis III or IV, readmission, and others. We recorded and analyzed minor AEs
including pain (tenderness, medial thigh pain, and
discomfort), access site complications (infection, skin necrosis, skin burn), superﬁcial thrombophlebitis (GSV
thrombosis, “saccular” thrombosis), paresthesia (numbness, saphenous neuralgia, sensory disturbance), endovenous heat-induced thrombosis I or II, pigmentation,
lymphatic complication (edema, swelling, phlebolymphedema, lymphocele), vasovagal reaction (dizziness),
hematoma not requiring treatment or transfusion
(ecchymosis, erythema, bruising, groin hematoma), local
allergy/hypersensitivity reaction, saphenous granuloma,
induration (lumpiness, cellulitis, palpable mass), anesthetic complications (not speciﬁed), failure of regional

anesthesia, vein tear, vein rupture, and nerve injury. To
address outcomes related to concomitant treatment
with phlebectomy or sclerotherapy, we identiﬁed three
comparative studies and one systematic review. Treatment of recurrence, cryostripping, steam ablation, and
single arm studies were excluded.
Data sources and search strategies. A comprehensive
search of several databases was conducted through
December 7, 2020. The databases included: Ovid
MEDLINE and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other
Non-Indexed Citations, and Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus.
The search strategy was designed and conducted by a
medical reference librarian with input from the

investigators. We also included references from experts
and bibliographies of included trials. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for
English studies of DUS examination for the detection of
saphenous vein incompetence, endovenous ablation, surgical stripping for saphenous vein incompetence in adults
with varicose veins, and ablation of incompetent perforator
veins in adults with simple varicose veins. The detailed
search strategy listing all search terms used and how they
are combined is available in Appendix A (online only).
Study selection and data extraction. Two reviewers
independently screened titles and abstracts of candidate
studies. Included studies by either reviewer were retrieved
for full-text screening. Pairs of independent reviewers
screened the full text of eligible studies. The

methodologic quality of studies and collected descriptive,
methodologic, and outcomes data were determined by
the reviewers. Data from included studies were extracted
by pairs of independent reviewers using a standardized
form created by a web-based program (DistillerSR,
Evidence Partners, Ottawa, Canada). Disagreements were
resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer.
Risk of bias and certainty of the evidence. Two independent reviewers assessed the risk of bias in the included
studies. The Cochrane tool for risk of bias assessment was
used for randomized clinical trials.17 This tool considers six

domains, including sequence generation, allocation
concealment, blinding of participants, incomplete
outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other
sources of bias such as the source of funding and conﬂict
of interest. We used a modiﬁed version of the NewcastleOttawa scale for observational studies,18 focusing on the
exposed cohort’s representativeness and nonexposed
cohort, ascertainment of exposure and outcomes,
comparability of cohorts, and adequacy of follow-up. For
diagnostic tests, we used QUADAS-2 (A Revised Tool for
the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies)19;
this tool considers four key domains, namely, patient

selection, index test, reference standard, and ﬂow and
timing. Certainty in estimates for key outcomes was
evaluated using the GRADE approach20-22 (Table II).
Statistical analysis. The relative risk (RR) was extracted
or calculated for binary outcomes. We calculated standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous results
when studies used different measures for the same effect (eg, pain scale). When studies used the same
outcome measure, we used the original scale and
expressed results as a weighted mean difference. Rate
ratios (ie, the ratio of the incidence rate of events within
a given time between the intervention and the comparison) were calculated for AEs. The DerSimonian and
Laird random effects method was used to combine effect sizes. We evaluated heterogeneity between studies
using I2 indicator. Analyses were based on the intentionto-treat principle for RCTs or the number of patients
initially assigned to the interventions at the start of the
study for observational studies.

Subgroup and sensitivity analysis. A prespeciﬁed
subgroup analyses were conducted based on patient characteristics (eg, age, sex), intervention techniques, concomitant interventions (eg, phlebectomy, sclerotherapy), and
publication timeline (ie, before and after 2016) for thermal
techniques. We also conducted sensitivity analyses in
which we excluded high risk of bias studies. We were
unable to evaluate clinical class of venous disease (CEAP
classiﬁcation-200423 vs CEAP classiﬁcation-202016) owing
to lack of comparative data.

We included 73 studies (in 94 publications) and one
systematic review (Key Question 1: 2 studies24,25; Key Question 2: 26 RCTs [in 35 publications]26-60 and 13 comparative
observational studies61-73; Key Question 3: 12 RCTs [in 18

sclerotherapy, we included 1 RCT (in 2 publications),114,115
2 comparative observational studies,116,117 and 1
systematic review (8 studies in 2147 patients).118
The included studies compared variant forms of the
available diagnostic and treatment modalities for lower
extremities varicose veins and enrolled 16,896 patients,
with a mean age of 51.6 years, and 68.5% were women.
The mean duration of follow-up was 20 months (range,
1-72 months).
A comprehensive summary of the included studies’
characteristics per question and their risk of bias are presented in Supplementary Tables I-III (online only).
Risk of bias
Of the included studies, 45 were RCTs (66 publications)26-60,74-91,100-108,112-115and 28 were comparative observational studies,61-73,92-99,109-111,116,117 of which 2 were
diagnostic.24,25 Most of the RCTs26-29,34,35,38,43-57,59,76-79,
81-90,100-108,112-115
had an intermediate overall risk of bias, 11
RCTs (13 publications)30,31,33,37,39-41,58,60,74,75,80,91 had a high
risk of bias, and 3 RCTs32,36,42 had a low risk of bias. Blinded
assessment of the outcome was rarely conducted.
In the observational studies, 17 studies25,63-66,70-73,
92,95,97,109,110,116,117,119
had an overall low risk of bias, and 11
studies24,62,67-69,93,94,96,98,99,111 had an intermediate risk of
bias. One study61 had a high risk of bias mainly owing to
lack of ascertainment of exposure, comparability, and adequacy of follow-up. Follow-up was adequate for all of
the studies except for ﬁve studies.61,62,65,99,117 Ascertainment of outcomes was arbitrated to be adequate in all
studies (outcomes were ascertained by the clinical
encounter, linkage medical records, or standardized questionnaire assessment). Details of the methodologic quality
of the included studies supporting the overall risk of bias
assessment for each study are summarized in
Supplementary Table III (online only).
Key Question 1. DUS examination to diagnose saphenous vein incompetence in patients with varicose veins
(CEAP class C2-C6)
No studies directly compared plethysmography,
computed tomography scan or MR imaging, or venogram to clinical examination or duplex. We included
two comparative observational studies24,25 that included
110 patients (151 limbs), a mean age of 45.5 years, and predominantly women. The primary outcomes were the
incompetence of the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ),

saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ), GSV, which was deﬁned
as (retrograde ﬂow in the GSV of >500 ms).
One study24 had an intermediate risk of bias,
compared DUS with HHD examination (deﬁned as
continuous wave Doppler only with no color or gray
scale imaging or use of pulsed Doppler examination).
The study demonstrated that the sensitivity of the
HHD technique was 73% at the SFJ, 77% at the SPJ,
and 51% for thigh perforators. In primary varicose veins,
surgical treatment planned using HHD examination
alone would have left residual sites of reﬂux in 24%.
The study concluded that examination with HHD examination is not sufﬁciently accurate to plan varicose vein
surgery and suggested the need for duplex scanning.24
The second prospective study25 had a low risk of bias
and compared DUS with HHD examination complemented by physical examination. The study demonstrated that the accuracy of HHD was 71% at the SFJ
and in the GSV (previously called the long saphenous
vein). However, in 90% of limbs, duplex scanning did
not affect surgical management (Supplementary
Table IV, online only).
Key Question 2. Surgical stripping vs endovenous ablation by any technique
We included 30 RCTs (44 publications)26-60,100-108
enrolling 5610 patients, and 16 comparative observational
studies61-73,109-111 enrolling 3220 patients. Nineteen RCTs
(32
publications)26-29,34,35,38,43-57,59,100-108
had
an
intermediate overall risk of bias; 8 RCTs (9
publications)30,31,33,37,39-41,58,60 had a high risk of bias mainly
owing to inadequate randomization, inadequate random
sequence generation, allocation concealment, unclear
blinding of outcome assessors, possible selective reporting,
and other sources of bias such as funding sources; 3
RCTs32,36,42 had a low risk of bias. Ten observational
studies63-66,70-73,109,110 had a low overall risk of bias, ﬁve
studies62,67-69,111 had an intermediate risk of bias, and one
study61 had a high risk of bias owing to lack of ascertainment of exposure, comparability of cohort, assessment of
outcomes, and lack of follow-up. The mean age was
47.5 years, with 65.3% women. Most of the patients had a
CEAP classiﬁcation of C2 to C6 (Supplementary Tables I-III,
online only).
Outcomes at 1 month.
Anatomic closure. HL/S was associated with higher
anatomic closure rates than RFA (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.011.18; 1 study109).
Pain. Compared with endovenous laser ablation
(EVLA), HL/S was associated with lower likelihood of being pain free (RR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.29-0.54; I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2
studies61,69), and increased need for analgesia (RR, 1.83;
95% CI, 1.17-2.86; I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies28,64).
Pigmentation. HL/S was associated with a lower risk of
pigmentation than RFA (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.83;
I2 ¼ 0.00%; 4 studies39,71,72,104).

Quality of life. No signiﬁcant difference was found in
the disease-speciﬁc QoL score when HL/S compared
with RFA at one month (SMD, e0.03; 95% CI, e0.66 to
0.59; I2 ¼ 77.8%; 2 studies40,58).
Recurrent varicosity. HL/S was associated with a lower
risk of recurrent varicosity compared with UGFS (RR, 0.24;
95% CI, 0.07-0.79; 1 study111).
Outcomes at 1 year.
Anatomic closure. HL/S was associated with lower
anatomic closure rates compared with EVLA (RR, 0.90;
95% CI, 0.83-0.97; I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies104,108), and a
better anatomic closure rates when compared with RFA
(RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.04-1.26; 1 study109). Anatomic closure
failures were described in Rasmussen et al104 as four
stripping procedures that failed because the stripper
perforated the GSV, and the vein could not be accessed
from below. In the series reported by Venermo et al,108
failure was owing to partial occlusion of GSV.
Pigmentation. HL/S was associated with a lower risk of
pigmentation than EVLA (RR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.13-0.54;
I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies49,100).
Quality of life. No statistically signiﬁcant association
was found in the disease speciﬁc QoL score when HL/S
was compared with RFA (SMD, 0.19; 95% CI, e0.62 to 1;
I2 ¼ 93.7%; 3 studies38,40,109).
Recurrent incompetence. HL/S was signiﬁcantly associated with an increased risk of recurrent incompetence
compared with RFA, while UGFS was associated with a
higher risk compared with surgery (RR,7.84; 95% CI, 1.8134.01; I2 ¼ 0.00%, 3 studies33,67,105) and (RR, 0.62; 95% CI,
0.41-0.94; I2 ¼ 19.60%, 2 studies56,105), respectively. No
statistically signiﬁcant association was found for recurrent incompetence when HL/S was compared with EVLA
(RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.26-5.47; I2 ¼ 78.2%; 4 studies27,47,49,105).
Additionally, compared with HL/S, EVLA was associated
with a higher patient satisfaction scores (SMD, e0.63;
95% CI, e0.87 to e0.38; I2 ¼ 56.7%; 1 study28). Compared
with UGFS, HL/S was associated with signiﬁcant improvement of ulcer healing (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.05-1.69; 1 study26)
and lower risk of reintervention (RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.25-0.86;
I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies100,105).
Outcomes at 5 years.
Anatomic closure. HL/S was associated with a higher
anatomic closure rate than UGFS (RR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.092.13; 1 study111). No statistically signiﬁcant association was
found when HL/S was compared with EVLA (RR, 1.03;
95% CI, 0.86-1.25; 1 study106).
Quality of life. There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in the generic QoL score between HL/S and EVLA
(SMD, 0.04; 95% CI, -0.14 to 0.22; I2 ¼ 40.6%; 3
studies50,59,107). Disease-speciﬁc QoL 5 years after treatment was better after HL/S than after UGFS (2.60; 95%
CI, 3.99 to 1.22; P < .001).102
Recurrent varicosity. Compared with RFA, HL/S was
signiﬁcantly associated with recurrent varicosity (RR,
2.00; 95% CI, 1.22-3.27; 1 study103). No statistically

signiﬁcant associations were found when HL/S was
compared with EVLA and UGFS (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.581.18; I2 ¼ 83.6%; 3 studies50,102,103) and (RR, 1.06; 95% CI,
0.74-1.54; I2 ¼ 65.60%; 2 studies102,103), respectively.
Recurrent varicosity scale. Compared with HL/S, UGFS
was associated with a higher recurrent varicosity score
(SMD, e0.33; 95% CI, e0.50 to e0.17; 1 study102). Outcomes are presented in Supplementary Table V (online
only).
Adverse events.
Minor AEs. Compared with RFA, HL/S was signiﬁcantly
associated with increased risk of minor AEs (RR, 1.70; 95%
CI, 1.17-2.48; I2 ¼ 75.1%; 10 studies33,36,38,39,51,57,58,71,104,109).
No statistically signiﬁcant association was found when
HL/S was compared with EVLA (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.761.28; I2 ¼ 78.4%; 12 studies34,37,49,61-64,69,73,101,104,108). HL/S
was associated with lower risk of minor AEs than UGFS
(RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55-0.88; I2 ¼ 43%; 7
studies26,32,56,66,101,104,108).
Serious AEs. There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between HL/S and EVLA, RFA, or UGFS (RR, 1.11;
95% CI, 0.50-2.48; I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies101,104), (RR, 1.41;
95% CI, 0.24-8.45; 1 study51) and (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.492.03; I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies101,104), respectively.
Total AEs. HL/S was signiﬁcantly associated with an
increased risk of total AEs than RFA (RR, 1.65; 95% CI,
1.16-2.35; I2 ¼ 72.5%; 10 studies33,36,38,39,51,57,58,71,104,109). No
statistically signiﬁcant association was found when HL/S
was compared with EVLA (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.77-1.27;
I2 ¼ 74.6%; 12 studies34,37,49,61-64,69,73,101,104,108). HL/S was
associated with lower risk of total AEs compared with
UGFS (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58-0.85; I2 ¼ 28.3%; 7
studies26,32,56,66,101,104,108).
There were no differences for short-, intermediate-, or
long-term outcomes such, as the Aberdeen Varicose Vein
Questionnaire, Aberdeen Varicose Vein Symptom Score,
Homburg Varicose Vein Severity Score, venous disability
score, Venous Clinical Severity Score, pulmonary embolism,
pain scale, DVT, propagation of thrombus, recurrent ulceration, thrombophlebitis, other minor AEs such as (vein
tear, development of thread vein, telangiectatic matting,
lipodermatosclerosis, keloid, phlebitis-like reaction, persistent compression, nausea, headache, and migraine), and
other total AEs when HL/S compared with different endovenous ablation techniques. Outcomes are presented in
Supplementary Table V (online only).
Small saphenous vein studies. We included two RCTs
(3 publications43,52,53) that compared HL/S with EVLA.
The two RCTs had an intermediate risk of bias. The studies
reported on 281 patients (mean age, 49.6 years; 68.4%
women) with CEAP class C2 to C6. One of the RCTs43,53
(HELP-2 [The Hull Endovenous Laser Project 2]) demonstrated that, when compared with EVLA, HL/S was associated with lower anatomic closure rates at one month
and an increased risk of minor sensory disturbance (RR,
0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.89; and RR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.23-9.94,

respectively). There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between the two groups regarding QoL scores,
recurrent varicosity, pigmentation, repeat intervention,
minor AEs, or serious AEs. Another RCT52 demonstrated
that HL/S was associated with lower anatomic
closure rates at 6 weeks (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58-0.90).
Anatomic closure failure was described in Roopram et al52
as 21% procedure failure/residual incompetence of the
SPJ in the HL/S group compared with 0.9% in the laser
group. HL/S was associated with an increased risk of
recurrent incompetence at 6 weeks, neurologic symptoms at 6 weeks, and surgical site infection (RR, 18.47; 95%
CI, 1.01-337.22; RR, 4.73; 95% CI, 2.06-10.85; and RR, 26.67;
95% CI, 1.53-465.40, respectively). HL/S was associated with
a lower risk of skin burn (RR, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.00-0.51). There
were no signiﬁcant differences for outcomes such as DVT
or QoL scores when HL/S compared with EVLA. Outcomes
are presented in Supplementary Table V (online only).
Key Question 3. Thermal ablation vs nonthermal
ablation
Thermal ablations included RFA and EVLA. Nonthermal
ablations included CAC, MOCA, and UGFS using sodium
tetradecyl sulfate or polidocanol to prepare the foam at
the bedside using the Tessari technique or physician using injectable polidocanol foam (Varisolve/Varithena). We
included 16 RCTs (27 publications)74-91,100-108 enrolling
4159 patients, and 11 comparative observational
studies92-99,109-111 enrolling 2390 patients. Fourteen RCTs
(24 publications)76,77,79,81-91,100-108,120 had an intermediate
overall risk of bias, two RCTs (3 publications)74,75,80 had a
high risk of bias, mainly owing to inadequate randomization, inadequate random sequence generation, allocation concealment, unclear blinding of outcome
assessors, possible selective reporting, and other sources
of bias such as funding sources. Five observational
studies94,96,98,99,111 had an intermediate overall risk of
bias, and six observational studies92,93,95,97,109,110 had a
low risk of bias. The mean age was 47.5 years, with
59.5% women. Most of the patients had CEAP classiﬁcation of C2 to C6 (Supplementary Tables I-III, online only).
Outcomes at 1 month.
Anatomic closure. EVLA was associated with lower
anatomic closure rates than CAC (RR, 0.90; 95% CI,
0.84-0.97; 1 study75).
Pain. EVLA was associated with a higher VAS pain score
when compared with CAC and UGFS (SMD, 0.76; 95% CI,
0.56-0.96; 1 study76) and (SMD, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.42-0.98;
I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies81,94).
Quality of life. EVLA was associated with worse generic
QoL scores when compared with MOCA and UGFS (SMD,
e22.22; 95% CI, e24.83 to e19.62; 1 study84) and
(SMD, e11.57; 95% CI, e12.31 to e10.84; 1 study101),
respectively. Compared with CAC, RFA was associated
with a worse generic QoL score (weighted mean difference, e17.56; 95% CI, e19.22 to e15.90; 1 study85).

Skin complications. EVLA was associated with an
increased risk of ecchymosis than CAC (RR, 2.17; 95% CI,
1.39-3.37; 1 study76).
Outcomes at 1 year.
Anatomic closure. EVLA was associated with higher
anatomic closure rates than UGFS (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.111.37; I2 ¼0.00%; 3 studies82,94,100).
Quality of life. RFA was associated with worse generic
QoL scores when compared with CAC (SMD, e19.02;
95% CI, e20.82 to e17.22; 1 study86).
Recurrent incompetence. RFA intervention was associated with an increased risk of recurrent incompetence
than CAC (RR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.07-9.64; I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2
studies86,97). Compared with UGFS, EVLA, and RFA were
associated with lower risk of recurrent incompetence
(RR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.05-0.59; 1 1study105) and (RR, 0.06; 95%
CI, 0.01-0.44; 1 study,105 respectively).
Reintervention. Compared with UGFS, EVLA and RFA
were associated with a lower risks of reintervention (RR,
0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.91; I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies100,105) and
(RR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02-0.98; 1 study105), respectively.
Outcomes at 5 years.
Anatomic closure. EVLA was associated with a higher
rate of anatomic closure than foam UGFS (RR, 2.91; 95%
CI, 1.89-4.49; 1 study102).
Quality of life. Disease-speciﬁc QoL 5 years after treatment was better after EVLA than after UGFS (2.86;
95% CI 4.49 to 1.22; P < .001). Generic QoL measures
were similar.102
Recurrent varicosity scale. EVLA was associated with a
lower recurrent varicosity scale score than UGFS (SMD,
e0.25; 95% CI, e0.43 to e0.07; 1study102).
Reintervention. RFA was associated with a lower risk of
reintervention compared with UGFS (RR, 0.44; 95% CI,
0.27-0.71; 1 study103). No signiﬁcant differences were
found for other outcomes such as DVT, recurrent varicosity, recurrent ulceration, edema, lumps, pigmentation,
or recurrent ulceration. Outcomes are presented in
Supplementary Table VI (online only).
Adverse events.
Minor AEs. EVLA was signiﬁcantly associated with
increased risk of minor AEs than CAC (RR, 3.29; 95% CI,
2.32-4.67; I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies75,76). However, compared
with UGFS, EVLA was associated with a lower risk of
minor AEs (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45-0.93; I2 ¼ 78.6%; 5
studies81,94,101,104,108). RFA was signiﬁcantly associated
with an increased risk of minor AEs than n-butyl
cyanoacrylate (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.13-2.33; 1 study93).
Serious AEs. RFA was signiﬁcantly associated with an
increased risk of serious AEs than CAC (RR, 2.90; 95%
CI, 1.06-7.92; 1 study97).

common complication of CAC is superﬁcial phlebitis,
which is usually mild and responds well to nonsteroidal
anti-inﬂammatory treatment.85 All outcomes and
other outcomes are presented in Supplementary Table VI
(online only).
Small saphenous vein and anterior accessory saphenous vein studies
We included one retrospective cohort99 that compared
RFA intervention with CAC intervention, reported on 335
patients (mean age, 57 years; 78% women) with CEAP
class C2 to C5. Thirty-one patients received treatment
for small saphenous vein (SSV), 14 received treatment
for anterior accessory saphenous vein, and most of the
cohort received treatment for GSV.
SSV outcomes. When RFA was compared with CAC,
there were no signiﬁcant differences for outcomes such
as anatomic closure at 1 month (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.881.12; phlebitis, RR, 3.60; 95% CI, 0.16-82.05; and paresthesia,
RR, 3.60; 95% CI, 0.16-82.05).
Anterior accessory saphenous vein outcomes. When
RFA was compared with CAC, there were no signiﬁcant
differences for outcomes such as anatomic closure at
1 month, RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.79-1.32; phlebitis, RR, 3.89;
95% CI, 0.22-68.67; and paresthesia, RR, 3.89; 95% CI,
0.22-68.67).
All
outcomes
are
presented
in
Supplementary Table VI (online only).
Key Question 4. Incompetent perforators ablation vs no
ablation
We included two RCTs.112,113 The two RCTs had an intermediate risk of bias. The studies reported on 141 patients
(mean age, 50 years; 49% women) with CEAP classes
C0 to C5. One of the studies112 randomized 72 patients
(C0-C5) to saphenofemoral ligation and stripping with
subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery and concomitant phlebectomy or to saphenofemoral ligation and
stripping with concomitant phlebectomy. There were
no statistically signiﬁcant differences between the two
groups up to 1 year regarding pain, mobility, or QoL
scores. A signiﬁcantly greater proportion of patients in
the no subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery group
had incompetent perforator veins on duplex imaging
at 1 year (25 of 32 vs 12 of 38; P < .001). However, clinical
recurrence was similar in both groups at 1 year
(Supplementary Table VII, online only). Another study113
randomized 69 patients (C2-C3) with varicose veins and
incompetent thigh perforators to saphenous ablation
with or without perforator ablation. Adding perforator
ablation resulted in similar clinical results and complications (bruising, ecchymosis, edema, and paresthesia)
than saphenous ablation alone. There was no statistically
signiﬁcant difference in anatomic closure of the treated
GSV at 1 month or 1 year.
No studies exclusively evaluated patients with simple
varicose veins (CEAP class C2) only, although the majority

of patients in the three studies were C2 patients. Data on
perforator ablation alone without saphenous ablation in
C2 patients were not available.
Saphenous ablation without or with concomitant
treatment with phlebectomy or sclerotherapy. We
included one RCT (in 2 publications),114,115 two observational studies,116,117 and one systematic review118 (8 studies
including Carradice et al114) to examine the effect of
concomitant treatment with phlebectomy or sclerotherapy vs no concomitant treatment. The total number of
patients was 6098, and the majority were women.
Short-term results conﬁrmed that concomitant phlebectomy prolonged the procedure but decreased the
need for secondary procedures and signiﬁcantly
improved QoL.114 Five-year results of the same RCT
showed excellent and similar clinical results and QoL
scores in both groups, but concomitant treatment was
associated with optimal improvement in both QoL and
the severity of clinical disease.115
When combined therapy, which included EVLT or RFA
with phlebectomy or sclerotherapy, was compared
with ablation only (unimodal therapy, with RFA or laser),
multivariate analysis revealed signiﬁcant reduction of the
Venous Clinical Severity Score scores on the combined
therapy vs the unimodal therapy groups (P ¼ .002).116
Brown et al117 analyzed outcomes in 3375 patients
enrolled into the Vascular Quality Initiative Varicose
Vein registry, with symptomatic C2 disease, who underwent saphenous ablation with RFA or EVLT; 59.9%
also had concomitant phlebectomies. An improvement in overall symptoms at more than 3 months
follow-up was experienced by 94.4% of patients with
more signiﬁcant decreases among patients undergoing ablation and phlebectomy (median, 12 points;
interquartile range, 8-17 points) compared with ablation alone (median, 9 points; interquartile range, 5-13
points; P < .001).
Overall, the available evidence from the identiﬁed systematic review showed that combined treatment of saphenous incompetence and symptomatic varicosities results
in better short-term and better to equivalent long-term patient outcomes.118 All outcomes and other outcomes are
presented in Supplementary Table VIII (online only).
Subgroup and sensitivity analyses
Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were feasible for Key
Question 2 and Key Question 3. Analyses were stratiﬁed
based on publication year (before and after 2016). For
most analyses, there was no statistically signiﬁcant differences between the two subgroup estimates. We also
conducted sensitivity analyses in which we excluded
studies with a high risk of bias, and the results were
consistent with the main analysis for most of the outcomes. All outcomes including estimates from subgroup
and sensitivity analyses are presented in Supplementary
Tables V and VI (online only).

DISCUSSION
Main ﬁndings. The evaluation and treatment of varicose veins and more advanced chronic venous insufﬁciency have progressed tremendously during the past
decade. Based largely on results of a systematic review
performed by Murad et al,11 the SVS and the AVF published clinical practice guidelines in 2011 on the care of
patients with varicose veins and associated chronic
venous diseases.9 The current systematic review on the
management of varicose veins analyzed data of 45 RCTs,
28 observational studies, and 1 systematic review and
revealed new evidence on safety, efﬁcacy, durability, AEs,
and patient-reported outcomes, including QoL of open
surgery and a large variety of minimally invasive percutaneous interventions used for the treatment of varicose
veins and associated superﬁcial or perforator vein
incompetence. To help update the key recommendations of the previous guidelines and increase reporting
transparency, this systematic review focused on four
major questions affecting varicose vein management.
The ﬁrst question was selected to determine if the evidence supports DUS examination as the diagnostic test
of choice for patients with varicose veins. This question
is important because DUS examination has become
the standard of care for most venous specialists. In addition, most insurance companies require a DUS report
with the minimum criteria of size and extent of venous
reﬂux for procedural authorization. However, some
venous specialists continue to use a HHD plus physical
examination to assess vein size and reﬂux; this is a qualitative assessment of a varicose vein, usually performed
by a physician, without visual documentation of the
anatomy, the extent of reﬂux, or its location. The venous
DUS study provides data not only on reﬂux time and
the size of each superﬁcial vein, but also anatomic
location, helping to differentiate between a duplicated
superﬁcial truncal vein and an accessory vein, as well as
the depth and extent of the reﬂux. In addition, a DUS examination can identify perforating veins along the path
of the truncal vein. All of this additional information
may have important therapeutic implications.
Unfortunately,
prospective,
randomized
studies
comparing a HHD examination with DUS examination
have not been performed since DUS examination
became the standard of care in the 1980s. However, the
studies in this current systematic review do conﬁrm
that DUS examination provides more objective, reproducible information for treatment and is more useful
regarding the location of superﬁcial reﬂux, the extent of
the reﬂux, the size of the reﬂuxing vein throughout its
course, the depth of the entire vein, and whether it is
above or below the superﬁcial fascia. It is also reproducible and reviewable for physicians who do not perform
their own diagnostic venous studies and use an
accredited vascular laboratory.

Of the studies reported, one study24 compared DUS
examination with HHD examination. The study demonstrated that the sensitivity of the HHD technique was
73% at the SFJ, 77% at the SPJ, and 51% for thigh perforators. In patients with primary varicose veins, a surgical
treatment plan using a HHD examination would have
left residual sites of reﬂux in 24%. The study concluded
that examination with HHD examination is not sufﬁciently accurate to plan varicose vein surgery; the authors
suggested DUS scanning.24 The second prospective
study25 compared DUS examination with HHD examination complemented by a physical examination. The
study demonstrated that the accuracy of HHD examination was only 71% in the SFJ; however, in assessing 90% of
limbs, DUS examination did not affect surgical management. Nevertheless, it should be noted that a DUS examination is performed routinely during endovenous
procedures, which allows a surgeon to modify their
approach, even when a preprocedure study is inaccurate.
Four other diagnostic studies121-124 did not meet the
eligibility criteria of deﬁning retrograde ﬂow in the GSV
of more than 500 ms, but overall adds to the body of
evidence supporting duplex scanning for evaluation of
patients with varicose veins. One study121 compared
DUS examination with HHD examination and clinical examination and demonstrated that the sensitivity of the
HHD to detect saphenous vein reﬂux was 56% at the
SFJ and 23% at the SPJ. Clinical examination failed to
correctly plan the treatment in 26% of proposed operations. In 9% of limbs, a HHD examination-based treatment plan was modiﬁed based on DUS ﬁndings. The
second study123 compared HHD examination with
diagnostic-quality portable color Doppler ultrasound examination and conventional DUS examination as the
gold standard for venous reﬂux disease assessment. The
study demonstrated that sensitivity of HHD examination
improves from moderate to good from the above-knee
level (68%) to the below-knee level (94%), but suffers
poor speciﬁcity. The third study122 compared HHD examination with DUS examination in assessing primary and
uncomplicated varicose veins and suggested a high
sensitivity and speciﬁcity for GSV incompetence identiﬁed by HHD examination. However, HHD examination
incorrectly diagnosed reﬂux at SPJ in some patients.
The fourth study124 compared color ﬂow duplex
scanning with venography and suggested that venographic reﬂux correlates best with duplex scan ﬁndings
of a reﬂux duration of greater than 0.5 second.
The second key question was about the effectiveness,
safety, and durability of HL/S compared with any endovenous ablation technique. To collect evidence, we
analyzed data of 30 RCTs26-60,100-108 and 16 observational
studies61-73,109e111 that included a total of 8830 patients
treated with HL/S, RFA, EVLA, USGF, CAC, MOCA, or Varithena foam for ablation of the incompetent GSVs or

SSVs. The quality of the studies differed to a great extent,
and eight RCTs,30,31,33,37,39-41,58,60 and one observational
study61 had a high risk of bias. The 30-day outcome
differences between interventions are important since
perioperative pain, wound complications, and AEs affect
the early QoL and rapid return to normal physical
activities. Signiﬁcant ﬁndings included a lower likelihood
of perioperative pain and less need for pain medications
for patients treated with EVLA compared with HL/S. Minor AEs were more frequent after HL/S vs RFA, but less
frequent than in patients who had UGFS. Diseasespeciﬁc QoL scores at 30 days were not different
between those who had RFA or HL/S. Early anatomic
closure rates were higher after HL/S vs RFA. Compared
with RFA, HL/S was signiﬁcantly associated with an
increased risk of minor AEs. At 1 year, those who
underwent UGFS had a higher risk of reintervention
than HL/S and had a higher risk of recurrent reﬂux. At
5 years, anatomic closure was the lowest among patients
who had UGFS. There was no difference in clinical
outcomes, patient-reported outcomes, or QoL scores in
patients using any interventional techniques.
The third question addresses outcomes of thermal vs
nonthermal ablations. Perioperative pain was signiﬁcantly lower after CAC and UGFS than after EVLA. Patients who had the MOCA procedure or UGFS had
better early QoL scores than those who had EVLT.
Anatomic closure rates were signiﬁcantly lower, and reinterventions were more frequent at 1 and 5 years after
UGFS than after EVLA or RFA. Recurrent reﬂux was
most frequent after UGFS. In one study93 of RFA and
two studies75,76 of EVLA, there were signiﬁcantly more
AEs than CAC. In a RCT by Brittenden et al,102 diseasespeciﬁc QoL 5 years after treatment was better after
EVLA than after UGFS (2.86; 95% CI, 4.49 to 1.22;
P < .001) and better after HL/S than after UGFS (2.60;
95% CI, 3.99 to 1.22; P < .001). Generic QoL measures
were similar. Early results of CAC vs RFA found no difference in anatomic closure or minor AEs in patients
treated for SSV incompetence.
The fourth question addresses the role of incompetent
perforator veins in the early stages of chronic venous insufﬁciency, such as CEAP 2 and 3 disease. One reason to
address the evidence related to perforator vein treatment
is that many vascular laboratories include a complete DUS
study to evaluate all patients with varicose veins. Because
they assess the deep, truncal, tributary, and perforator
veins, once incompetence is identiﬁed at any site, a decision regarding treatment must be made. The perforator
treatment question was also selected because many
perforator procedures are currently being performed in
patients with simple CEAP 2 varicose veins, either
concomitant with truncal vein ablation or after recovery
from ablation of the saphenous vein, assuming that
incompetent perforators are responsible for any remaining venous insufﬁciency. One area not addressed in this

systematic review is the role of perforator incompetence
in patients with venous ulcers; O’Donnell et al125 in the
AVF/SVS Venous Ulcer Practice Guidelines addressed
the role of perforator vein ablation in patients with open
and healed venous ulcers.
This systematic review of the role of treatment of
incompetent perforator veins included two randomized
studies.112,113 In these studies, there were no statistically
signiﬁcant differences between groups with and without
perforator closure regarding pain, mobility, or QoL scores.
The study by Van Neer et al119 demonstrated no difference in postoperative reﬂux in the GSV branches after
saphenous ablation in patients with incompetent perforator veins. The authors concluded that reﬂux in the
below-knee GSV persists in all below-knee GSV branches
after proximal stripping or ablation, and these residual
varicose veins were not related to the presence of incompetent perforator veins. Therefore, there is little evidence
to support the treatment of incompetent perforator
veins in patients with CEAP 2 varicose veins. No study
evaluated patients with CEAP 2 varicose veins after
saphenous ablation to determine their impact on
incompetent perforator veins.
Strengths and limitations. The strengths of this
systematic review relate to a priori research design,
comprehensive search of multiple databases, and
collaboration with experts from SVS and AVF. One limitation relates to the high risk of bias in many included
studies. Another limitation is the small number of
studies included per key question, limiting the ability
to detect publication bias and exploring heterogeneity.
Our systematic review targeted patients with primary
varicose veins and indeed 88% of the included studies
have explicitly excluded patients deep venous
insufﬁciency, a previous DVT or a congenital anomaly.
Nevertheless, some studies may have included such
patients.

CONCLUSIONS
The current systematic review summarizes the evidence to support SVS/AVF/American Vein and
Lymphatic Society clinical practice guideline recommendations. The evidence supports duplex scanning for evaluation of patients with varicose veins and conﬁrms that
HL/S resulted in similar long-term saphenous vein
closure rates than EVLA and in better rates than RFA
and UGFS. Thermal interventions were associated with
inferior generic QoL scores than nonthermal interventions, but had a lower risk of recurrent incompetence
than UGFS. The ultimate recommendations in the guidelines should consider the information presented here as
well as other factors such as patients’ values and preferences, anatomic considerations of individual patients,
and surgical expertise.
