ABSTRACT
Background: Decision-making related to the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is complex.
Aneurysms present with varying risks of rupture, and patient-speciﬁc factors inﬂuence anticipated life expectancy,
operative risk, and need to intervene. Careful attention to the choice of operative strategy along with optimal treatment
of medical comorbidities is critical to achieving excellent outcomes. Moreover, appropriate postoperative surveillance is
necessary to minimize subsequent aneurysm-related death or morbidity.
Methods: The committee made speciﬁc practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development, and Evaluation system. Three systematic reviews were conducted to support this guideline. Two focused on
evaluating the best modalities and optimal frequency for surveillance after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). A third
focused on identifying the best available evidence on the diagnosis and management of AAA. Speciﬁc areas of focus
included (1) general approach to the patient, (2) treatment of the patient with an AAA, (3) anesthetic considerations and
perioperative management, (4) postoperative and long-term management, and (5) cost and economic considerations.
Results: Along with providing guidance regarding the management of patients throughout the continuum of care, we
have revised a number of prior recommendations and addressed a number of new areas of signiﬁcance. New guidelines are
provided for the surveillance of patients with an AAA, including recommended surveillance imaging at 12-month intervals for
patients with an AAA of 4.0 to 4.9 cm in diameter. We recommend endovascular repair as the preferred method of treatment
for ruptured aneurysms. Incorporating knowledge gained through the Vascular Quality Initiative and other regional quality
collaboratives, we suggest that the Vascular Quality Initiative mortality risk score be used for mutual decision-making with
patients considering aneurysm repair. We also suggest that elective EVAR be limited to hospitals with a documented
mortality and conversion rate to open surgical repair of 2% or less and that perform at least 10 EVAR cases each year. We also
suggest that elective open aneurysm repair be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality of 5% or less and that
perform at least 10 open aortic operations of any type each year. To encourage the development of effective systems of care
that would lead to improved outcomes for those patients undergoing emergent repair, we suggest a door-to-intervention
time of <90 minutes, based on a framework of 30-30-30 minutes, for the management of the patient with a ruptured
aneurysm. We recommend treatment of type I and III endoleaks as well as of type II endoleaks with aneurysm expansion but
recommend continued surveillance of type II endoleaks not associated with aneurysm expansion. Whereas antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for patients with an aortic prosthesis before any dental procedure involving the manipulation of
the gingival or periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended before
respiratory tract procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures, and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures
unless the potential for infection exists or the patient is immunocompromised. Increased utilization of color duplex ultrasound is suggested for postoperative surveillance after EVAR in the absence of endoleak or aneurysm expansion.

Conclusions: Important new recommendations are provided for the care of patients with an AAA, including suggestions
to improve mutual decision-making between the treating physician and the patients and their families as well as a
number of new strategies to enhance perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing elective and emergent repair.
Areas of uncertainty are highlighted that would beneﬁt from further investigation in addition to existing limitations in
diagnostic tests, pharmacologic agents, intraoperative tools, and devices. (J Vasc Surg 2018;67:2-77.)

DEFINITION OF THE PROBLEM
Purpose of these guidelines. The Clinical Practice
Council of the Society for Vascular Surgery charged a
writing committee with the task of updating practice
guidelines, initially published in 20031 and subsequently updated in 2009,2 for surgeons and physicians
who are involved in the preoperative, operative, and
postoperative care of patients with AAAs. This document
provides recommendations for evaluating the patient
(including risk of aneurysm rupture and associated
medical comorbidities), guidelines for intervention,
intraoperative strategies, perioperative care, long-term
follow-up, and treatment of late complications.
Decision-making related to the care of patients with AAA
is complex. Aneurysms present with varying risks of
rupture, and patient-speciﬁc factors inﬂuence anticipated life expectancy, operative risk, and need to intervene. Careful attention to the choice of operative
strategy, as inﬂuenced by anatomic features of the AAA,
along with optimal treatment of medical comorbidities
is critical to achieving excellent outcomes. Moreover,
appropriate postoperative surveillance of the patient and
timely intervention in the case of a late complication are
necessary to minimize subsequent aneurysm-related
death or morbidity. All of these clinical decisions are
determined in an environment where cost-effectiveness
will ultimately dictate the ability to provide optimal
care to the largest possible segment of the population.
Currently available clinical data sets have been reviewed
in formulating these recommendations. However, an
important goal of this document is to clearly identify
those areas where further clinical research is necessary.
Methodology and evidence. A comprehensive review
of the available clinical evidence in the literature was
conducted to generate a concise set of recommendations. The strength of any given recommendation and
the quality of evidence were graded on the basis of the
GRADE approach.3 The quality of evidence derived
from randomized trials has an initial rating of high,
whereas evidence derived from observational studies has
an initial rating of low. GRADE domains are then used to
modify this initial rating; these domains include risk of
bias, consistency of the results across studies, directness
of the populations and interventions of the studies to the
question at hand, precision of the estimates of effect, and
size of the observed effect. When the beneﬁts of an
intervention outweighed its risks or, alternatively, risks
outweighed beneﬁts, a strong recommendation was
noted. However, if beneﬁts and risks were less certain,
because of low-quality evidence or because high-quality
evidence suggests that beneﬁts and risks are closely
balanced, a weak recommendation was recorded.
Guideline developers used the term we recommend to
denote strong recommendations, whereas for weak
recommendations, they used the less deﬁnitive wording

we suggest. Thus, quality of evidence was rated high
when additional research is considered very unlikely to
change conﬁdence in the estimate of effect, moderate
when further research is likely to have an important
impact on the estimate of effect, or low when further
research is very likely to change the estimate of the
effect. On occasions, the guideline committee made
good practice statements, which are ungraded recommendations advising about performing certain actions
considered by surgeons to be essential for patient care
and supported only by indirect evidence.
Literature search and evidence summary. Three
systematic reviews were conducted to support this
guideline. Two focused on evaluating the best modalities and optimal frequency for surveillance after EVAR.
A third umbrella systematic review (overview of reviews)
was focused on identifying the best available evidence
on the diagnosis and management of AAA. The date
range of this search was from 1996 to September 19,
2016, and included Ovid MEDLINE In-Process & Other
Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase,
Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus.
The search strategy was designed and conducted by an
experienced librarian with input from the guideline
methodologist. Controlled vocabulary supplemented
with keywords was used to search for meta-analyses and
randomized controlled trials of diagnosis and therapy
for AAA. The actual strategy is available in the Appendix
(online only). This search yielded 1206 references,
from which 29 evidence synthesis reports (systematic
reviews and meta-analyses) were used to grade the
quality of evidence (Table I) in various topics that relate
to AAA, such as screening, diagnosis, surveillance, and
treatment.

GENERAL APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
History and risk factors for AAA
The risk of an AAA as well as of aneurysm enlargement
and rupture for each patient and related family members can largely be determined by a thorough medical,
family, and social history. Abdominal aortic ultrasound
screening studies obtained in the United States between
2003 and 2008 were analyzed from >3 million men and
women, from diverse racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic
backgrounds.33 Participants completed a 36-item questionnaire on demographic and medical, social, and family history information as well as self-reported weight and
height.
These data were used to generate a multivariable
model for risk, which conﬁrmed age as the most significant risk factor for development of an AAA, with a
signiﬁcant increase in risk for the ages of 65 to 69 years
(odds ratio [OR], 5.4) and 75 to 79 years (OR, 14.5).

AAA, Abdominal aortic aneurysm; CTA, computed tomography angiography; DUS, duplex ultrasound; EVAR, endovascular aneurysm repair; ICU,

Consistent with prior estimates,34-38 an AAA was more
likely among men (OR, 5.7) and less common in
Hispanics (OR, 0.7), African Americans (OR, 0.7), and
Asian Americans (OR, 0.7).
This study also conﬁrmed the close epidemiologic
association of cigarette smoking and aneurysmal disease. A smoking history of <0.5 pack per day for up to
10 years carried a signiﬁcant increased risk of an AAA
(OR, 2.6), which increased in a dose-dependent manner
such that smoking more than one pack per day for >35
years was associated with a 12-fold increased risk
(OR, 12.1). Reduced risk was noted for smoking cessation,
diabetes mellitus, eating fruits and vegetables more than
three times a week, and exercise more than once a week.
The protective effects of healthy diet and physical activity
have been conﬁrmed in other reports.39-41 Increasing risk
has also been noted with increased salt intake,42 high
blood pressure, concomitant peripheral arterial disease
and cerebrovascular disease, and family history of AAA
(Table II).33
Given the prevalence of AAA-related risk factors in the
United States, the prevalence of AAA, as deﬁned by an

aortic diameter >3 cm, was estimated at 1.4% among
those between 50 and 84 years old, or 1.1 million adults.
Importantly, these ﬁndings largely concur with and
expand on prior prevalence and association estimates
derived from more homogeneous populations, such as
male military veterans.43 First-degree relatives of patients
with an AAA have an approximately 20% likelihood for
development of an AAA.44,45
The association between cigarette smoking and AAA
disease deserves special emphasis.46 More than 90% of
patients with AAA have smoked cigarettes at some point
in their lifetime, and AAA is second only to lung cancer in
epidemiologic association to cigarette smokingdmore
closely associated than either cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease.47 For patients with early aneurysmal
disease, a recent meta-analysis concluded that smoking
increased the rate of aneurysm enlargement by 35%.9
Current smokers are more than seven times more likely
to have an aneurysm than nonsmokers, with duration
of smoking the most important variable. Each year of
smoking increases the relative risk for development of
an aneurysm by 4%.48 The decades-long decline in per

capita cigarette consumption in American adults has
been paralleled by a similar decline in deaths from
ruptured AAA (Fig 1).49
Estimates of the incidence of death from ruptured AAA
have declined by >50% in the last 20 years, probably
because of multiple factors including declining cigarette
consumption, increased public awareness of AAA disease, improved surgical outcomes and access to treatment afforded by endovascular repair techniques, and
general improvement in management of cardiovascular
disease risk factors.50-52 However, in countries where
cigarette consumption remains high or is increasing,
aneurysm-related mortality continues to increase.53
Although the risk of inhaled, vaporized nicotine from
e-cigarettes and similar nicotine delivery devices has
yet to be determined, multiple investigations suggest
that exposure to nicotine alone may promote the development and progression of an AAA.54-56
Risk factors for rupture are also relevant in evaluating
and managing patients with a known or suspected
AAA. In the UK Small Aneurysm Trial (UKSAT), the annual
risk of rupture was 2.2%. Factors signiﬁcantly and independently associated with rupture included female
gender, large initial aneurysm diameter, low forced expiratory volume in 1 second, current smoking history, and
elevated mean blood pressure.57,58 Multiple studies
have suggested that women are at greater risk for
rupture,59,60 as are patients receiving immunomodulatory therapy after major organ transplantation.61-63
Women who smoke are at high risk for an AAA. In a
recent Swedish population study, women with a history
of smoking of >20 pack-years were nearly twice as likely

to develop AAA as men with a similar smoking history.64
However, the risk of AAA after smoking cessation
declines more rapidly in women than in men.64
Increased aortic mural calciﬁcation has also been
suggested as a risk factor for rupture.65
Rupture risk for those unﬁt for repair in the Aneurysm
Detection and Management (ADAM) trial was 9% per
year for patients with aortic diameters between 5.5
and 5.9 cm, 10% for aneurysms between 6.0 and 6.9
cm, and 33% for those $7.0 cm.66 More recent experience suggests that rupture estimates based on aortic
diameter may need revision downward. Pooled analysis
from natural history studies and control arms of interventional trials indicate that current rupture risk may
be as low as 5.3% per year for AAAs between 5.5 and
7.0 cm in diameter and 6.3% per year for AAAs >7.0
cm. Among asymptomatic patients, the risk of death
from causes other than AAA, regardless of aneurysm
diameter, was higher than the risk of death from aneurysm rupture.67
Careful review of the surgical history is also essential for
accurate and timely recognition of AAA disease. Cholecystitis, appendicitis, or pancreatitis may mimic the
presentation of a symptomatic aneurysm. In addition,
the nature and extent of previous abdominal surgery
may inﬂuence the operative approach. When a pulsatile
mass is discovered in a patient after prior OSR of an AAA,
the presence of an anastomotic pseudoaneurysm,68 iliac

Physical examination
An AAA is generally deﬁned as an enlargement of the
abdominal aorta to $3.0 cm in diameter. The abdominal
aorta begins at the diaphragm, typically at the twelfth
thoracic vertebra, and lies in the retroperitoneum just
anterior to and slightly left of the vertebral column.
With increasing age, the aorta elongates and enlarges,
so the location of a pulsatile mass on physical examination can be variable. At the level of the umbilicus and
fourth lumbar vertebra, the aorta bifurcates into the right
and left common iliac arteries. The focused examination
for an aortic aneurysm should be directed at the upper
abdominal quadrants.
Physical examination has only a moderate sensitivity for
detecting AAA, depending on the extent of abdominal
girth and aneurysm size.74 The common iliac arteries
may also become aneurysmal and palpable in the lower
abdominal quadrants. A number of theories have been
proposed to explain the predilection of aneurysmal
degeneration to the abdominal aorta and common iliac
arteries, but none are deﬁnitive.75 Palpation does not
precipitate rupture, and the concern for a symptomatic
aneurysm should not preclude thorough examination.
An abdominal aneurysm is common (37%-40%) in
patients with popliteal artery aneurysms,76-78 as are
concurrent distal arterial aneurysms in patients with an
AAA.79-81

In patients with a suspected or known AAA, we recommend
performing physical examination that includes an
assessment of femoral and popliteal arteries.
In patients with a popliteal or femoral artery aneurysm, we
recommend evaluation for an AAA.

Assessment of medical comorbidities
Preoperative evaluation of cardiac risk. Despite
improvements in cardiovascular risk factor management,
5-year survival after successful aneurysm repair remains
below 70%.82-84 Cardiovascular and pulmonary disease
remain the leading causes of early and late death after
OSR or EVAR.85 EVAR is associated with a threefold
reduction in perioperative mortality compared with
propensity-matched patients undergoing elective OSR,86
including even younger patients with fewer comorbidities.87,88 For patients with advanced chronic renal
insufﬁciency89 and oxygen-dependent COPD,90 EVAR
outcomes are superior to those achieved with contemporary OSR, particularly when it is performed under local
or regional anesthesia. However, despite the reduced risk
compared with OSR, EVAR remains an intermediate- to
high-risk procedure for cardiovascular complication.

Given the risk associated with either OSR or EVAR, it is
essential to evaluate the overall operative risk associated
with either method of repair. The ﬁrst step should be to
determine whether an active cardiovascular condition
exists (Table III), which would mandate further assessment and management before planned aneurysm
repair. In the absence of an active cardiovascular condition, further testing, as dictated by functional capacity
and cardiovascular risk factors, is indicated only if the results will change the planned treatment approach.
Functional capacity can be estimated from a simple activity assessment (Table IV). Patients capable of moderate physical activities, such as climbing two ﬂights of
stairs or running a short distance (MET $ 4), will not
beneﬁt from further testing. Those who do not function
at this level or in whom physical reserve cannot be
assessed will beneﬁt from cardiac testing if it will
change operative management.91 Recent studies suggest that low anaerobic threshold (#10 mL O2/kg/min)
during exercise testing, as a measure of aerobic capacity, is predictive of cardiovascular complications as well
as of early and late death after aortic aneurysm
repair.92-94
All patients should be evaluated with a 12-lead ECG
within 30 days of planned repair. Although resting
left ventricular function, as determined by an echocardiogram, does not predict postoperative MI or death,
echocardiography is recommended for those patients
with dyspnea of unknown origin or worsening
dyspnea in the setting of a history of congestive heart
failure.
In patients with active cardiac conditions, including unstable
angina, decompensated heart failure, severe valvular
disease, and signiﬁcant arrhythmia, we recommend
cardiology consultation before EVAR or OSR.

Preoperative coronary revascularization. A metaanalysis of 22 studies examining >13,000 patients with
coronary artery disease identiﬁed an AAA in 8.4% of patients.95 Routine coronary artery revascularization in patients with stable cardiac symptoms and absent left

main coronary artery disease or severe aortic stenosis
does not alter the risk of MI, death, or long-term survival
among patients undergoing elective vascular surgery.96,97 Coronary revascularization is indicated for acute

elevation, unstable angina, and stable angina in the
presence of left main coronary artery or three-vessel
disease as well as for two-vessel disease, including the
proximal left anterior descending artery and either
ischemia on noninvasive testing or reduced left ventricular function.
The risk for perioperative stent thrombosis for both
bare-metal stents and drug-eluting stents in the coronary arteries is highest in the ﬁrst 4 to 6 weeks after
implantation. Surgery should be delayed for 14 days after
coronary angioplasty and 30 days after a bare-metal
stent if dual antiplatelet therapy cannot be continued
through the perioperative period. Likewise, OSR should
not be performed within 6 months after implantation
of a drug-eluting stent if cessation of dual antiplatelet
therapy is required.98 This recommendation assumes
the use of newer generation drug-eluting stents in
patients with stable ischemic heart disease. Thus, percutaneous EVAR should be considered the operative
method of choice if aneurysm treatment becomes
necessary within 6 months after placement of a drugeluting stent as dual antiplatelet therapy can typically
be continued with use of this approach.
In summary, a recommendation for percutaneous or
surgical intervention for coronary artery disease should
follow established clinical practice guidelines, regardless
of the need for aneurysm repair.91 Whereas simultaneous
open aneurysm repair and coronary artery bypass grafting has been reported for select symptomatic patients
with critical coronary artery disease,99-102 if it is anatomically feasible, EVAR under local anesthesia would be a
preferred option.
We suggest coronary revascularization before aneurysm repair in

Perioperative medical management of coronary
artery disease. The initiation of beta blockade before
noncardiac surgery has been associated with an
increased risk of stroke and all-cause mortality.103-105
The use of an a2 agonist is no longer recommended to
prevent cardiac events, nor is that of calcium channel
blockers, such as diltiazem and verapamil, given their
potential to impair myocardial function in patients with
reduced left ventricular function. Continuation of ACE
inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers is based on
individual clinical circumstances.91
Aspirin reduces adverse cardiovascular events among
patients with coronary artery disease and can be
continued during the perioperative period.106 Both
warfarin and the new oral anticoagulants (nonvitamin K
antagonist oral anticoagulants) should be discontinued
at least 5 days and 2 days, respectively, before major surgery.107 The need for low-molecular-weight heparin as a
bridge depends on the indication for anticoagulation.

patients presenting with ruptured AAA has largely been
attributed to cigarette smoking as a common risk

20

factor.59 Common genetic, inﬂammatory, and remodeling pathways that predispose patients to both conditions may also be present.108 Several studies have
reported that COPD is an independent predictor of
mortality after open repair,34,109 with the severity of
pulmonary disease and the capacity to optimize preoperative respiratory function inﬂuencing outcome.110 EVAR
is better tolerated than OSR, particularly if EVAR is
performed under local anesthesia.111,112 However, patients
with severe COPD exhibit increased in-hospital mortality,
pulmonary complications, major adverse events, and
decreased 5-year survival whether they are treated with
open repair or EVAR.90
If COPD is suspected or present, room air arterial blood
gas determinations and standard pulmonary function
testing should be performed before surgery. In the
setting of oxygen-dependent COPD, pulmonary consultation should be obtained for assessment of prognosis
and optimization of medical therapy. Smoking cessation
before aneurysm repair and administration of pulmonary
bronchodilators for at least 2 weeks are recommended.
The diagnosis of an aortic aneurysm can be a strong
motivator for smoking cessation,113 and efforts to begin
smoking cessation before surgery can result in longterm beneﬁts.114 Nicotine replacement115 and use of
nortriptyline and bupropion, alone or in combination,
along with inpatient and outpatient counseling have
proven beneﬁcial for smoking cessation.116
We suggest preoperative pulmonary function studies, including
room air arterial blood gas determinations, in patients with a
history of symptomatic COPD, long-standing tobacco use, or

Renal insufﬁciency. Preoperative renal insufﬁciency is
an established risk factor for poor outcome after aneurysm repair. Among patients with moderate renal
dysfunction (eGFR of 30-60 mL/min), mortality and cardiovascular events are more likely for patients treated
by OSR than by EVAR.89 However, outcomes are uniformly poor in the presence of severe renal dysfunction
(eGFR < 30 mL/min), regardless of the type of repair.
Outcomes are equally poor after EVAR or OSR for the
patient requiring dialysis, with a 30-day mortality of 11%,

with Kaplan-Meier survival estimates of 66% at 1 year and
37% at 3 years.117 Median survival was 2 years.117
Signiﬁcant declines in renal mass and eGFR have been
documented after OSR and EVAR, even in the setting of
age-adjusted normal renal function before surgery.118 For
example, acute kidney injury and chronic kidney injury
have been noted after complex EVAR with snorkel or
renal stent placement, with an increased risk among
women.119 Even transient postoperative renal dysfunction is associated with an increase in mortality, morbidity,
and the need for additional ICU support.120
Several strategies have been recommended to minimize renal injury after EVAR or OSR. Hydration with
either normal saline or sodium bicarbonate is recommended to ensure euvolemia.121 Similarly, given the
association of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor
antagonists with hypotension on induction of anesthesia,
these medications should be held the morning of
surgery and restarted after the patient is euvolemic.122,123
Whereas the administration of many agents has been
evaluated, none have proved of value in limiting renal
injury after AAA repair. Antioxidants, such as mannitol,
before or during OSR have demonstrated no beneﬁt.124
Likewise, fenoldopam, dopamine, atrial natriuretic peptide, diuretics, and antiplatelet and anti-inﬂammatory
agents are of no value in the prevention or treatment
of acute kidney injury.125 Last, remote ischemic preconditioning has been studied as a strategy for reducing the
risk of renal dysfunction. However, systematic review
and meta-analysis of the current literature do not
conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of this technique in patients undergoing major vascular surgery.126-129
CIN is deﬁned as a 25% increase in serum creatinine
concentration or an absolute increase of 0.5 mg/dL 2 to
7 days after administration of contrast material. Patients
with renal disease (eGFR # 45 mL/min/1.73 m2), diabetes,
congestive heart failure, ejection fraction <40%, hypertension, anemia, advanced age, proteinuria, and gout
are at increased risk for CIN.130 Gadolinium is not a safe
alternative to iodinated contrast agents, given the risk
for nephrogenic systemic ﬁbrosis in patients with a GFR
of <30 mL/min/1.73 m2.
There is a linear relationship between the volume of
contrast material administered and the onset and
severity of CIN. For every 100 mL of contrast material
infused during coronary artery interventions, there is a
12% increase in the risk for CIN.131 Preprocedural hydration may be beneﬁcial, but fenoldopam, dopamine, atrial
natriuretic peptide, theophylline, and calcium channel
blockers are not.132 Preprocedural administration of oral
N-acetylcysteine is recommended for at-risk patients,
given its low cost, safety proﬁle, and mild protective
effect. However, a randomized trial of N-acetylcysteine
did not reduce the incidence of CIN after EVAR.133
Recent evidence suggests that statin therapy may be of
beneﬁt in preventing CIN. For example, two studies

Journal of Vascular Surgery

Chaikof et al

21

Volume 67, Number 1

suggest that initiating high-dose statin therapy 2 days
before exposure to contrast material and continuing for
3 days afterward may reduce the risk for CIN in patients
undergoing coronary interventions.134,135 A recent metaanalysis concluded that the administration of statins
along with N-acetylcysteine and intravenous saline had
clinically important and statistically signiﬁcant beneﬁts
as a prevention strategy for CIN compared with the use
of N-acetylcysteine and saline alone.136
Contrast agents with osmolality of >780 mOsm/kg
display increased nephrotoxicity. Additional nephroprotection through further reduction in osmolality was suggested by a study comparing iohexol (Omnipaque, a
low-osmolar agent; 600-800 mOsm/kg) with iodixanol
(Visipaque, an iso-osmolar agent; 290 mOsm/kg).137
However, rates of CIN for iopamidol (Isovue-370, 796
mOsm/kg, nonionic) are similar to those for iodixanol,
which suggests that other physiochemical properties,
apart from osmolarity, are important determinants of
CIN.138 Likewise, several randomized trials of ionic
and nonionic contrast agents have demonstrated no
difference in CIN.139
In summary, minimizing the volume of any type of
contrast agent is essential to reducing the risk of CIN,
and all nephrotoxic drugs should be stopped at least
48 hours before administration of contrast material.
Patients at increased risk for CIN should be hydrated
before and after EVAR. Normal saline at 1 mL/kg/h can
be administered for 6 to 12 hours before and after the
procedure. Alternatively, 5% dextrose/sodium bicarbonate can be administered at 3 mL/kg/h for 1 hour before
EVAR and at 1 mL/kg/h for 6 hours afterward. Periprocedural N-acetylcysteine may be of beneﬁt to reduce CIN.
Additional strategies to limit contrast agent load include
use of carbon dioxide,140 intravascular or duplex ultrasound,141 and fusion imaging.142
We suggest holding ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor
antagonists on the morning of surgery and restarting these
agents after the procedure, once euvolemia has been
achieved.

Diabetes mellitus. Diabetic patients have increased
operative mortality after AAA repair, with reduced

survival 2 to 5 years after surgery, consistent with an
increased burden of cardiovascular disease.143 However,
whether diabetes is a distinct risk factor for major
adverse events or death after OSR or EVAR is not well
deﬁned.144-148
Metformin is a ﬁrst-line medication for the treatment of
type 2 diabetes and prescribed for >100 million patients
worldwide. Metformin is contraindicated if the eGFR is
below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 because of the risk of lactic
acidosis, which carries a mortality of up to 50%.149 Given
the risk of CIN after conventional or CT angiography and
the association of metformin with lactic acidosis among
patients with renal insufﬁciency, an eGFR of <60 mL/min
should prompt the cessation of metformin either at the
time of administration of contrast material or up to 48
hours before if eGFR is <45 mL/min.150 Metformin should
be restarted no sooner than 48 hours after administration of contrast material as long as renal function has
remained stable (<25% increase in creatinine concentration above baseline).150

Hematologic disorders. The presence of an aortic
aneurysm inﬂuences both platelet count and function.
Low platelet counts and high glycocalicin levels have
been observed in patients with an AAA, which has
been attributed to increased platelet destruction within
the aneurysm sac.151 Whereas a threshold of platelet
count below which elective AAA repair should be deferred has not been addressed, further evaluation is
warranted if the platelet count is <150,000 platelets/mL.
After elective OSR, a platelet count of <130,000/mL is
associated with an increased risk of bleeding.152 Platelet
sequestration and thrombocytopenia may occur after
OSR, which may persist for several weeks, especially
when proximal clamping necessitates periods of renal or
visceral ischemia.153 Matsumura and colleagues suggested that a lower preoperative platelet count is an independent predictor of 2-year mortality among patients
undergoing both EVAR and OSR.154

inhibitor 1, and lipoprotein(a) have been observed among
patients with aortic aneurysms, but their role in

Biomarkers and heritable risks for an AAA
Biomarkers for the presence and expansion of an
aortic aneurysm. The identiﬁcation of circulating
biomarkers for AAA disease remains an area of active
investigation. Such markers may assist in identifying
new targets for pharmacotherapy and may improve
both the diagnosis of AAA disease and monitoring of
the response to medical or surgical therapy. Among
biomarkers evaluated to date, ﬁbrinogen, D-dimer, and
interleukin 6 have been consistently associated with
the presence of AAA in multiple cross-sectional, casecontrolled studies.158 A meta-analysis has reported that
ﬁbrinogen, D-dimer, and thrombin-antithrombin III
complex levels are increased in patients with AAA.159
Matrix metalloproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of matrix
metalloproteinase 1, interleukin 6, C-reactive protein,
a1-antitrypsin, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein
A, and high-density lipoprotein are also differentially
expressed in patients with AAA. Whereas a linear correlation has been noted between C-reactive protein and
aortic diameter,160 this observation is at odds with at
least one prior report.161 A number of microRNAs related
to smooth muscle cell function and collagen formation
have also been suggested as possible AAA biomarkers.56,162-165 At the current time, none of these
candidates has the sensitivity, speciﬁcity, or rigorous
clinical validation to be relied on as a diagnostic or
prognostic indicator for rupture risk.166,167
Genetic markers identifying risk of aortic aneurysm.
Genetic inﬂuences in AAA disease, ﬁrst suggested by Clifton,168 have been demonstrated by twin studies169 and
by formal segregation analyses.170 Genetic predisposition
likely represents small contributions from a large
number of risk alleles, with the effect dependent on the
population under consideration as well as relevant environmental considerations, such as cigarette smoking.171
Most genomic studies have investigated singlenucleotide polymorphisms in genes related to AAA
pathogenesis. Potential AAA-related single-nucleotide
polymorphisms have been identiﬁed in genes encoding

ACE, 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, angiotensin II type 1 receptor, interleukin 10, matrix metalloproteinase 3, and transforming growth factor b
receptor II.172
The use of genome-wide DNA linkage analyses relies on
traditional proband and family tree studies. Examination
of families with two or more members with an AAA has
identiﬁed variations on chromosomes 4 and 19.172 Allelic
variation at the q31 locus on chromosome 4 may inﬂuence endothelin signaling and respiratory epithelial
response to injury, such as cigarette smoking.173,174
Several genome-wide association studies have also
been conducted for various cardiovascular diseases,175
at least three of which have focused on AAA.176 A number of genetic loci have been implicated in AAA pathogenesis (Table V).172 The noncoding region of
chromosome 9p21 has been identiﬁed as an important
source of heritable risk for coronary and peripheral arterial disease as well as for AAA, independent of smoking,
hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The at-risk allele may
mediate this effect by downregulating the cell cycle regulatory gene CDKN2B.177 Epigenetic regulation of gene
expression through microRNA production and posttranslation regulation of gene expression may also inﬂuence inﬂammation, ﬁbrosis, or other mechanisms relevant to AAA pathogenesis.178,179
Some monogenic diseases increase the risk of AAA,
including mutations within the COL3AI gene, associated
with an autosomal dominant defect in type III collagen
synthesis present in patients with the Ehlers-Danlos
phenotype180,181 or mutations in ﬁbrillin 1, responsible
for Marfan syndrome.182 In Ehlers-Danlos and Marfan syndromes, isolated AAA is uncommon in the absence of
other arterial aneurysms or aortic dissection, respectively.
Aneurysm imaging
Modalities for aneurysm imaging. Among asymptomatic patients, ultrasound detects the presence of an AAA
accurately, reproducibly, and efﬁciently. Sensitivity and
speciﬁcity approach 100%, but in 1% to 3% of patients,
the aorta cannot be visualized because of bowel gas or
obesity.183,184 Transabdominal ultrasound is ideal for
screening and surveillance185 but insufﬁciently precise for
procedural planning or more complex morphologic analyses.186-188
CT imaging is more reproducible than ultrasound, with
>90% of measurements within 2 mm of the initial
reading.189 Both techniques suffer from a lack of standardization in terms of determining the degree and
rate of disease progression.190 An aneurysm measured
by standard axial CT is generally >2 mm larger in diameter than when it is measured by ultrasound. Most
commonly, the cross-sectional measurement obtained
by CT is not necessarily perpendicular to the path of
the aorta, which presumably contributes to an overestimation of aneurysm size. There is also signiﬁcant

variability in reporting of aneurysm diameter, particularly
in research studies, which have included diameter
measurements based on outer wall to outer wall, inner
wall to inner wall, and anterior outer wall to posterior
inner wall.191 Diameter measurements based on orthogonal rendering as well as path lengths and centerline
measurements have been largely superseded by the
adoption of three-dimensional reformatting software
and dedicated computer workstations to obtain curved
multiplanar reformatted images.192
The increasingly small size and low cost of portable
ultrasound units and absence of radiation or administration of nephrotoxic contrast material with ultrasound
have made it the preferred technique for aneurysm
screening and surveillance.193-195 However, aneurysm
diameter measurements, whether through the use of
CT or ultrasound imaging, are most reliable and reproducible when standardized measurement techniques
are used and the maximum transverse dimension
measured orthogonal to the vessel axis is reported. Moreover, it is essential that ultrasound examination be
performed by a qualiﬁed individual skilled in vascular
imaging. For operative planning, CT remains an essential
tool, given its precision, reproducibility, resolution, capacity for complete anatomic examination, and data conversion into numerous reformatting and measurement
programs. Plain abdominal ﬁlms and catheter-based
digital subtraction angiography have low sensitivity for
the detection of AAA. The luminal contour of the aneurysmal aorta visualized by angiography may be obscured
by accumulated mural thrombus, particularly in the case
of larger aneurysms.
Ultrasound has become a mainstay of emergency
medical practice and is used with increasing accuracy
and facility in the differential diagnosis of abdominal
pain. High sensitivity and speciﬁcity have been reported
in detecting nonruptured aneurysms,195,196 and use
of bedside ultrasound signiﬁcantly reduces time to

diagnosis and treatment.197,198 However, regions of the
retroperitoneum may not be well visualized in nonfasting patients or those with ileus or excessive intestinal
gas.199
The accuracy of CT imaging for diagnosis of symptomatic and ruptured AAA has also improved because of
advances in coordinated timing and appropriate dosage
of contrast material as well as through the use of multidetector arrays and image postprocessing. Timed
boluses of contrast material greatly increase the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of CT imaging.200 With modern
equipment and imaging techniques, false-positive CT
interpretation is low,201 and radiographic ﬁndings of
rupture are well characterized.202
We recommend using ultrasound, when feasible, as the
preferred imaging modality for aneurysm screening and
surveillance.

Prediction of aneurysm expansion and rupture risk.
A signiﬁcant unmet need in the assessment of AAA
disease is a determination of rupture risk. Maximum
AAA diameter remains the most widely used and
validated criterion for prediction of rupture risk. The
adoption of maximum diameter as a measure of rupture
risk was based, in part, on a retrospective review of
24,000 consecutive autopsies performed during 23 years
at a single institution.203 Of the 473 nonresected AAAs
identiﬁed in this series, 118 were ruptured. Approximately
40% of AAAs >5 cm in diameter were ruptured. However,
40% of AAAs between 7 and 10 cm were not ruptured,

24

whereas 13% of AAAs <5 cm were ruptured.203 Thus, a
variety of potentially more sensitive predictors of rupture
risk have been proposed, including AAA expansion
rate,58,66,204,205 wall stiffness,206-208 wall tension,209 and
peak AAA wall stress.210-212
Hall and colleagues have suggested that rupture is
imminent above a critical aortic wall stress, predicted
by the law of Laplace and maximum AAA diameter.209
Several other investigators subsequently demonstrated
that wall stress is highly dependent on AAA shape rather
than diameter alone.210-216 With ultrasound-based
assessment, determination of peak wall stress may
soon be translatable to real-time assessment of the patient.217 Modeling by computational ﬂuid dynamics has
suggested that intraluminal hemodynamic conditions
also inﬂuence AAA growth, remodeling, and risk of
rupture.218-222
The peak wall rupture index considers both peak wall
stress and residual wall strength and has been proposed
as more predictive than estimates of peak wall stress
alone.223-225 Further analyses have also incorporated the
inﬂuence of intraluminal hemodynamic conditions on
wall stress and strength indices through ﬂuid structure
interaction simulations.226,227 The value of CTdetermined intraluminal thrombus volume228,229 as
well as positron emission tomography-CT imaging in
predicting rupture risk remains uncertain.230,231 The
utility of positron emission tomography may require
the development of AAA-speciﬁc radiotracer agents.232
Beyond an assessment of rupture risk, there is a clear
role for imaging-based criteria for the prediction of
disease progression. As revealed in surveillance studies,
many small AAAs do not enlarge.233 Molecular imaging
of pathologic processes characteristic of aortic degeneration, including angiogenesis,234 matrix disruption,235
activated macrophage localization,236 and proteolysis,237
is being translated to the clinic238-241 and may help identify those patients with an increased likelihood of disease
progression.
Gender-speciﬁc rupture indicators have been evaluated, given the increased risk for rupture in women at
any given aortic diameter. A recent computational study
of patient-speciﬁc anatomy using ﬁnite element analysis
was unable to identify signiﬁcant differences in peak wall
stress and peak wall rupture indices between men and
women.242 Although aneurysm diameter remains a
well-established parameter for clinical decision-making,
a retrospective analysis has suggested that aneurysm
diameter indexed to body size (aortic size index ¼ aneurysm diameter [cm]/body surface area [m2]) may represent a superior predictor of rupture risk for women.243
Recommendations for aneurysm screening. Aneurysm screening has been motivated by a desire to reduce
AAA-related mortality and to prolong life expectancy.
Overall, the probability of AAA in the general population
is low but signiﬁcantly increased when certain risk factors

are present.33 Four randomized clinical trials that
included 127,891 men and 9342 women between 65 and
79 years of age provided evidence that ultrasound
screening is effective in reducing aneurysm-related
mortality.244-249 This beneﬁt begins within 3 years of
testing and persists for up to 15 years.250 In addition,
screening is associated with a reduced risk for AAA
rupture and emergency surgery.250
The Multicenter Aneurysm Screening Study (MASS)
group, the largest of the four randomized clinical trials,
reported that during 13 years, there was a 42% reduction
in AAA-related mortality and a small reduction in allcause mortality. It was estimated that 216 men needed
to be invited to screening to save one death during 13
years. Of those aneurysms that did rupture, roughly half
had an initial baseline diameter of 2.5 to 2.9 cm at initial
screening.251
Screening for AAA in women is more controversial.
Because few women were included in these trials, a
decrease in AAA-related mortality or incidence of
rupture could not be identiﬁed.5 Although AAA prevalence is lower in women, the rate of rupture and overall
life expectancy are higher, which suggest that screening
may be more cost-effective in women.252
In 2005, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF) recommended a one-time screening by
abdominal ultrasound for men aged 65 to 75 years
with a history of smoking.253 In 2014, the USPSTF
updated their 2005 recommendations to include onetime ultrasound screening for men aged 65 to 75 years
who have ever smoked (grade B) and selective screening
of 65- to 75-year-old men who have never smoked (grade
C). Screening was not recommended for women aged 65
to 75 years who have never smoked (grade D), and evidence was insufﬁcient to recommend for or against
screening in women aged 65 to 75 years who had a
smoking history.254 The USPSTF recommendations are
based on the assumption that 6% to 7% of men with a
smoking history in the 65- to 75-year age group will
have an AAA. In the absence of a smoking history, the
prevalence drops to 2%. The prevalence of AAA is 0.8%
in a similar age group of women who have a past history
of smoking, but for women who are current smokers, the
prevalence is 2%. In women who have never smoked,
AAA prevalence is <0.60%.254
In 2007, following passage of the Screening Abdominal
Aortic Aneurysms Very Efﬁciently (SAAAVE) amendment
in 2006, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began offering one-time screening by ultrasound
for men aged 65 to 75 years if they had smoked $100 cigarettes in their lifetime and for men and women with a
family history of AAA disease as part of their Welcome
to Medicare physical examination. As originally
mandated, the screening could be ordered only by the
primary care physician within 6 months of the activation
of Medicare beneﬁts.253 However, by 2012, it was

apparent that <3% of abdominal ultrasound claims were
for SAAAVE-speciﬁc AAA screening, and although
abdominal ultrasound examinations in the affected age
groups had increased, there was no discernible effect
on AAA rupture or all-cause mortality.255 Subsequent
Medicare eligibility guidelines have been modiﬁed to
allow additional physician specialists to order the tests
and to increase the window of eligibility.
Many additional opportunities exist to improve
screening and surveillance practices in the United States.
Currently, 40% of operative repairs in Medicare beneﬁciaries are performed late in the course of the disease,
suggesting that a prior screening opportunity had been
missed.256 A signiﬁcant portion of patients present with
rupture despite known AAA status.256 In an analysis of a
cohort of >3 million individuals, it was suggested that
small changes in recommended eligibility requirements,
such as accounting for the impact of accumulated cardiovascular risk factors, would improve the screening
yield for women, nonsmokers, and other groups traditionally considered at lower risk.33
Effective use of the electronic health record to improve
screening of target populations has been demonstrated
by Kaiser Permanente of Southern California.257 “Best
practice alerts” for AAA screening criteria were integrated
into the electronic health record and reduced the percentage of unscreened patients within their 3.6 million
subscriber system from 52% to 20% within 15 months.
These alerts were directed to nursing staff when patients
checked in for any visit with any provider. Automatic
screening orders were then entered that clinicians would
sign when visit-speciﬁc relevant orders were completed.
Patients who had undergone any type of crosssectional abdominal imaging in the preceding 10 years
(>54,000) were excluded from the alert system.257
In addition to the United States, governmentsponsored screening programs have been implemented
in the United Kingdom and Sweden, and the results
reﬂect the changing epidemiology of aneurysmal disease. In Sweden, the screening yield was less than half
that expected, despite widespread participation.258 Similarly, in the ﬁrst 3 years of the U.K. National Health Service
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Program, AAA
detection rate was only 1.6%, less than 50% of that expected on the basis of the results of the prior MASS
cohort.259 However, cost-effectiveness calculations
derived from MASS (£7600/life-year gained) suggest
that AAA screening in England and other European
countries will remain cost-effective even with prevalence
rates as low as 1%.260-262
Other challenges to efﬁcient implementation of
screening include the identiﬁcation and exclusion of patients who have had prior abdominal cross-sectional imaging studies, accounting for increasing longevity,
potential needs for late rescreening,263 and selective
screening to optimize yield at minimal cost.264 Reducing

all-cause mortality and enhancing yield might be
increased by integrating AAA screening with concurrent
echocardiography265 or blood pressure and peripheral
vascular disease testing.266 Ensuring full participation
for all groups of patients at risk remains an ever-present
challenge.267,268

Recommendations for aneurysm surveillance. Surveillance imaging should use ultrasound examinations
unless other imaging modalities are speciﬁcally indicated. The optimal frequency for surveillance after recognition of early-stage AAA disease has not been deﬁned
by randomized clinical study. Some authors have suggested that there is no need to observe patients with an
initial aortic diameter <3 cm, given their low risk for
rupture.248,269 However, in a 12-year analysis of 1121 men
65 years of age or older, 13.8% of aortas with an initial
diameter of 2.6 to 2.9 cm exceeded 5.5 cm at 10 years.
Among patients with an aortic diameter between 3.0
and 3.4 cm, 2.1% had reached 5.5 cm at 3 years; and of
those with a diameter between 3.5 and 3.9 cm, 10.5%
exceeded 5.5 cm or required surgery within 2 years.
Rupture occurred in 1.4%.
Two randomized controlled trials, the UKSAT270 and the
U.S. Veterans Affairs ADAM trial,271 as well as a follow-up
study of patients detected in the U.K. MASS trial246
demonstrated that a policy of surveillance until aneurysm
diameter exceeds 5.5 cm is safe and associated with a
rupture rate of 1% per year. Whereas aortic size was
deﬁned by the maximum external aortic diameter, the
surveillance frequency differed among these studies.
In an analysis of expansion rates of 1743 participants
in the UKSAT, AAA growth rate increased with

aneurysm size and among current smokers was lower
in those with low ABI and diabetes and was unaffected
by lipids and blood pressure.272 Combining the results
of 18 surveillance studies with similar imaging and
assessment protocols, the RESCAN collaborators identiﬁed a pooled growth rate across all studies of 2.2 mm/y,
with no signiﬁcant difference between men and
women. When estimates were pooled using randomeffects meta-analysis, following further adjustment for
all demographics and medical and drug history, rates
of aneurysm enlargement were signiﬁcantly increased
in smokers and decreased in those with diabetes
(Fig 2). Pooled meta-analysis failed to identify the
effects of any class of drug on aneurysm expansion.9
After adjustment for initial aneurysm diameter, medical
history, and demographics, a strong association was
noted between smoking and rupture (hazard ratio,
2.02; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 1.33-3.06; P ¼ .001)
and a far higher risk for women than for men (hazard
ratio, 3.76; 95% CI, 2.58-5.47; P < .001). Rupture risk
was increased in older participants, those enrolled in
earlier studies, those with lower body mass index, and
those with higher mean arterial or pulse pressure. The
effect of any class of drug was difﬁcult to evaluate
because of the low incidence of rupture.9
Thompson and associates performed a metaregression of growth estimates based on aneurysm
diameter (Fig 3) and time to a 10% probability of

attaining an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm (Fig 4).273 Integrating cost-effectiveness data, the authors proposed
recommendations for surveillance intervals based on
aortic size. Several years was recommended for men
with an initial AAA diameter between 3.0 and 4.0 cm,
whereas an interval of 1 year was recommended for
AAAs between 4.0 and 4.9 cm and 6 months for those
between 5.0 and 5.4 cm. However, the presence of diabetes, female sex, and current smoking history were
not accounted for by the model or considered within
this set of recommendations.273 The increased risk of
aneurysm rupture in women and patients with a smoking history has confounded attempts at standardizing
surveillance intervals.
We suggest surveillance imaging at 3-year intervals for
patients with an AAA between 3.0 and 3.9 cm.

Recommendations for imaging of the symptomatic
patient. In patients with abdominal or back pain, ultrasound imaging is recommended to determine whether
an AAA is present and to evaluate for the presence of
other causes of abdominal or back pain. If an aneurysm
is detected, the patient should have CT aortography
with timed intravenous injection of contrast material, if
it is not contraindicated, to exclude rupture and to facilitate operative planning. A patient presenting with a
large AAA and back or abdominal pain should be
referred for treatment as soon as an aneurysm is recognized, regardless of evidence for rupture or symptom
evolution or whether a CT scan has been completed.
If hemodynamic compromise is present or evolves
during the process of evaluation, further imaging studies
should be abandoned as care is escalated.
We recommend a CT scan to evaluate patients thought to
have AAA presenting with recent-onset abdominal or back
pain, particularly in the presence of a pulsatile epigastric
mass or signiﬁcant risk factors for AAA.

TREATMENT OF THE PATIENT WITH AN AAA
The decision to treat
It is recognized that the majority of patients will be
asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis of an AAA. Less
frequently, the ﬁrst presentation of an unrecognized AAA
may, in fact, be a symptomatic aneurysm manifested by
abdominal or back pain or even rupture. Should this be
the case, prompt treatment is recommended.
Most AAAs are fusiform rather than saccular, and
current recommendations for treatment of asymptomatic fusiform AAA rest primarily on the maximum transverse diameter as measured on ultrasound, CT, or
magnetic resonance imaging. Conventional arteriography can easily underestimate the true diameter by
not accounting for luminal thrombus.
There is general agreement that small aneurysms, <4.0
cm in maximum diameter, are at low risk of rupture and
should be monitored, whereas an aneurysm >5.4 cm in
diameter should be repaired in an otherwise healthy
patient. Elective repair is also recommended for patients
who present with a saccular aneurysm, and although
size guidelines are currently lacking because of their

infrequent presentation, repair is generally recommended at a smaller diameter.
Some controversy exists regarding treatment strategies for patients who present with an AAA between
4.0 and 5.4 cm. In the UKSAT274 and the ADAM trial,275
the 30-day operative mortality in the immediate
surgery groups (5.5% UKSAT, 2.1% ADAM) led to an
early disadvantage in survival. The investigators found
no statistically signiﬁcant difference in long-term
survival between the immediate OSR and surveillance
groups. Currently, nearly 80% of all AAAs are treated
by EVAR in the United States.276,277 Given the less invasive nature of EVAR, two studies re-evaluated the
appropriateness of intervention for small aneurysms.
The Comparison of Surveillance versus Aortic Endografting for Small Aneurysm Repair (CAESAR)278 and
Positive Impact of Endovascular Options for Treating
Aneurysms Early (PIVOTAL)279 trials compared immediate EVAR with surveillance for AAAs between 4.1 and
5.4 cm (CAESAR) and 4.0 and 5.0 cm (PIVOTAL) and
found no survival beneﬁt for early EVAR, but neither
trial was designed to determine whether immediate
EVAR might be beneﬁcial or harmful for speciﬁc AAA
size ranges or age subgroups. A Cochrane database
review280 of these four studies demonstrated no advantage to immediate repair by open surgery or EVAR for
small AAAs (4.0-5.5 cm).
Patients with an asymptomatic fusiform AAA >5.4 cm
should be considered for repair, and surveillance is

recommended for smaller aneurysms. An individualized
approach may be appropriate for patients with an AAA
>5.4 cm but who are of advanced age or have signiﬁcant
comorbid conditions. Alternatively, young, healthy
patients, particularly women, with an AAA between 5.0
and 5.4 cm or those with rapid expansion of small
fusiform AAAs may beneﬁt from early repair.9,273,281,282

Medical management during the period of aneurysm
surveillance
In the presence of a small aortic aneurysm, several
approaches have been proposed to prevent further
enlargement.47 Smoking cessation is the most important
intervention for a patient with an aneurysm.9,272,273,283,284
Hemodynamic control with propranolol has not been
shown to inhibit aneurysm expansion.285,286 Despite the
beneﬁts of statins in cardiovascular disease, their ability
to limit aneurysm expansion is lacking.287-290 ACE inhibitors and losartan, an angiotensin receptor antagonist,
decrease the rate of AAA expansion in mice, but clinical
investigations have reported conﬂicting results.291,292
Clinical trials of b-adrenergic receptor blockade demonstrate no effect on the rate of aneurysm progression.285,286 Likewise, beta blockade, lipid-lowering
agents, and angiotensin receptor blockade do not
appear to alter rupture risk, but an increased risk of
rupture has been reported for patients who recently discontinued ACE inhibitors.293
Some have suggested that serologic evidence of Chlamydophila pneumoniae infection may be associated
with AAA expansion,294 but a prospective randomized
trial demonstrated that azithromycin had no effect on
aneurysm enlargement.295 Doxycycline can inhibit
matrix metalloproteinases in plasma and aneurysm tissue and thus has been proposed as an agent to limit
AAA growth.296,297 However, a randomized trial of
low-dose doxycycline (100 mg once daily) demonstrated
no reduction in aneurysm growth during an 18-month
period.298 An ongoing National Institutes of Health trial
is examining the effectiveness of a higher dose of doxycycline (100 mg twice daily).
In summary, during the surveillance period, patients
should be counseled to cease smoking if tobacco products are being used. Patients should be encouraged to
seek appropriate medical management for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and other atherosclerotic
risk factors. A statin and ACE inhibitor should be considered, given the broad potential beneﬁts to cardiovascular disease and acceptable safety proﬁle. Insufﬁcient
data currently exist to recommend use of doxycycline
or roxithromycin. Patients should be counseled that
moderate physical activity does not precipitate rupture
or inﬂuence AAA growth rate.41,299

growth and rupture.

Timing of intervention
A patient with a known AAA or pulsatile mass on
abdominal examination who presents without hemodynamic instability and acute onset of back or abdominal
pain should undergo an immediate CT scan to determine whether rupture has occurred. Whereas a ruptured
AAA represents a surgical emergency, the timing of
aneurysm repair for patients with a symptomatic but
nonruptured aneurysm represents a clinical dilemma.
Under select circumstances, it may be appropriate to
delay intervention for several hours to ensure conditions
for successful repair, including optimizing anesthetic
support, as well as blood product or device availability.
If such an approach is elected, the patient should be
closely monitored in an ICU.
A more frequent concern is the timing for treatment of
an asymptomatic, large AAA, >5.4 cm in diameter. In the
ADAM trial, rupture risk was estimated at 10% per year
for aneurysms between 5.5 and 6.9 cm in diameter but
>33% per year when aneurysms were 7 cm or larger in
diameter.66 Recent reports, however, suggest that
contemporary rupture rates may be lower than previously
estimated. For example, a pooled analysis from natural
history studies and control arms from interventional trials
calculated a rupture risk of 6.3% per year for aneurysms >7
cm in diameter.67 In general, should a patient be considered a surgical candidate, repair of a large aneurysm
should not be unduly delayed. Pertinent preoperative
assessment should be conducted in a timely manner to
optimize outcomes, especially for patients with associated comorbid conditions. Given the risk of rupture, both
patient and family need to understand and to accept
the rationale for any delay related to further evaluation.
Whether a recent surgical procedure, such as an
abdominal colectomy, coronary artery bypass, or prostatectomy, can increase the likelihood of aneurysm rupture
remains an unsettled question.99,300 It has been suggested that inﬂammation and the induction of a

30

Journal of Vascular Surgery

Chaikof et al

catabolic state may result in enhanced collagen proteolysis with an increased risk of rupture. However, animal
studies have not found evidence of increased aortic
collagenase activity,301 nor has this notion been supported by a prospective clinical study.302 It seems
unlikely that the risk of aneurysm rupture is substantially
increased by an unrelated operation and that a severalweek delay to enable satisfactory recovery is acceptable
before elective AAA repair.
In summary, the optimal timing of AAA repair is based
on clinical presentation and aneurysm status: a ruptured
AAA requires emergent repair; a symptomatic, nonruptured aneurysm is best treated urgently; and an asymptomatic AAA can be treated electively after completion
of preoperative assessment. Delay in the treatment of
an asymptomatic, large AAA should be minimized.

We recommend immediate repair for patients who present
with a ruptured aneurysm.

Assessment of operative risk and life expectancy
Several prediction models developed to estimate operative risk for open AAA repair and EVAR hold the promise
of better informing patients of their individual risk of
perioperative mortality and provide surgeons a useful
tool to ensure an informed discussion with patients
and their families. Risk prediction models for aneurysm
repair were ﬁrst developed in the 1990s, largely derived
from relatively small cohorts of several hundred patients
treated by OSR.303 The most well known of this ﬁrst generation of risk model were the Glasgow Aneurysm Score
(GAS), the Leiden Score, and the Hardman Index. As one
example, the GAS was developed from a cohort of 268
open AAA repairs, of which 41% of patients presented
with ruptured aneurysms and the overall mortality was
20%. The risk score accounted for age, presence of shock,
renal disease, and history of myocardial or cerebrovascular disease.304 The European Collaborators on Stent/graft
Techniques for aortic Aneurysm Repair (EUROSTAR) suggested that the GAS could be used to estimate mortality
for EVAR with 30-day mortality of 1.1% for GAS <74, 2.1%
for GAS of 74 to 84, and 5.3% for GAS >84.305
During the past 7 years, a variety of new risk scoring
schemes have been derived from an assessment of patients who have undergone either open repair or EVAR
to speciﬁcally account for the mortality risk associated

with EVAR. Egorova and coworkers used Medicare data
to identify EVAR patients with increased operative risk
due to the presence of many of the same risk factors
for mortality that had been previously identiﬁed among
patients undergoing open repair, including age, renal
failure, congestive heart failure, peripheral artery disease,
and liver disease.306 They found that only 3.4% of Medicare patients undergoing EVAR had an operative risk
>5%, but a subset, which represented <1% of patients
undergoing EVAR, was identiﬁed with a predicted mortality of >10%. In an analysis of Medicare patients undergoing open repair and EVAR, including a review of prior
Medicare claims data to obtain a reliable assessment of
pre-existing comorbidities, Giles and colleagues found
age, renal failure, heart failure, female sex, and peripheral
or cerebral vascular disease to be predictive of perioperative mortality for either EVAR or open aneurysm repair
(C statistic, 0.726).307 For the ﬁrst time, a single scoring
scheme was developed that could be applied to patients
to assess risk for either EVAR or OSR. Recently, Eslami
and collaborators used the Vascular Study Group of
New England database to develop a new risk model
that included anatomic features, such as aneurysm
diameter, neck length, and level of clamp placement,
that had not been incorporated in prior scoring schemes
(C statistic, 0.822; Table VI, A and B).308 This model has
since been validated using the VQI database and has
been recently endorsed by the VQI for risk stratiﬁcation
of patients under consideration for planned open repair
or EVAR.
The delivery of clinically appropriate care requires
balancing operative risk with the likelihood of late survival. Patients with aortic aneurysms suffer higher rates
of heart attacks, strokes, and major amputation and
have an increase in 5-year mortality compared with
age-matched controls.84 Bahia and colleagues recently
conducted a systematic review of long-term survival after
aneurysm repair.84 Patients with large aneurysms, at
greatest risk of rupture, also had signiﬁcantly worse 5year survival. As one would anticipate, many of the
same risk factors for perioperative death also have an
impact on life expectancy. One-year survival after hospital admission for heart failure is 60%. One-year survival
after initiation of dialysis is 85% but decreases for those
with signiﬁcant comorbidities to 60%. The 3-year survival
after initiation of home oxygen therapy for COPD is 60%.
In the EVAR 2 trial, patients with severe coronary artery
disease, COPD, or poor renal function were considered
ineligible for open repair. Whereas the study has been
criticized for its trial design, EVAR did not affect overall
survival. Two-year survival was 60% and 5-year survival
was 35%.309 De Martino and coworkers assessed survival
after EVAR within the Vascular Study Group of New
England population using the EVAR 2 trial criteria.310
Five-year survival for patients with aneurysms smaller
than 6.5 cm was 46%; and for patients with aneurysms

EVAR
EVAR has rapidly expanded as the preferred approach
for treatment of AAA since the ﬁrst report >25 years
ago.312,313 Since the introduction of EVAR, the annual
number of deaths from intact and ruptured AAAs has
signiﬁcantly decreased in the United States. This has
coincided with an increase in elective AAA repair and a
decrease in the diagnosis and repair of ruptured AAAs.51

lower proﬁle delivery sheaths that are tapered, ﬂexible,
and coated for low-resistance introduction into the
femoral arteries. Concomitantly, devices have been
designed to facilitate percutaneous closure of femoral
artery puncture sites of increasing dimension. Together,
these have reduced the requirement for open surgical
exposure of the femoral artery. A randomized study
comparing open exposure and the percutaneous “preclose” technique using the Perclose ProGlide (Abbott
Vascular, Santa Clara, Calif) device demonstrated both
safety and effectiveness.314 After femoral artery access,
systemic anticoagulation with 100 units/kg of intravenous heparin is recommended with a target activated
clotting time $300 seconds.
Infrarenal ﬁxation. EVAR requires nonaneurysmal
proximal and distal attachment sites or sealing zones
as dictated by device-speciﬁc instructions for use.
Most endografts that are dependent on infrarenal ﬁxation have required a proximal sealing zone of at least
15 mm in length, a neck diameter <32 mm, and a neck
angulation of <60 degrees. Several devices now report
efﬁcacy with shorter neck lengths and more severe
levels of angulations. Use of devices outside recommended parameters increases the risk of device
migration, delayed type IA endoleaks, and aneurysm
rupture.
Suprarenal ﬁxation. Suprarenal ﬁxation has been
proposed as a more effective means of proximal ﬁxation
when the morphologic features of the proximal aortic

neck are unfavorable, including shortened neck length,
severe angulation, reverse taper, barrel-shaped neck,
circumferential mural thrombus, and extensive neck
calciﬁcation. Whereas concerns have been raised about
the risks of renal or mesenteric embolization, occlusion,
and end-organ ischemia, observational studies have
documented the efﬁcacy and safety of suprarenal
ﬁxation.315-319 The rate of renal dysfunction appears to
be equivalent for endografts that use nitinol or stainless
steel transrenal stents and not signiﬁcantly different
from that observed with infrarenal ﬁxation.318 Although
suprarenal ﬁxation may produce a higher incidence of
small renal infarcts, these do not appear to be clinically
signiﬁcant in most patients. Renal dysfunction after
EVAR with suprarenal ﬁxation is likely to be multifactorial and transient in most patients.320 Nonetheless,
renal artery occlusion and infarctions have been reported in patients with pre-existing renal artery occlusive disease, and although infrequent, visceral
dysfunction and celiac or mesenteric artery occlusion
may occur secondary to suprarenal ﬁxation.321-324 One
report showed no difference in renal function between
the two device types, whereas another study demonstrated a reduction in renal function after the use of a
suprarenal ﬁxation device.325,326 A recent meta-analysis
examining the renal complications after standard
EVAR with suprarenal and infrarenal ﬁxation demonstrated no difference in renal complications.327
Management of the internal iliac artery. Exclusion of
the hypogastric artery (HA) to prevent a type II endoleak is usually required when the aneurysm involves
either the distal common iliac artery or the HA itself.328-332 Several observational studies have revealed
that unilateral embolization of the HA can be performed during EVAR with minimal adverse events as
long as the contralateral HA is patent.329,330 Although
ipsilateral buttock claudication and erectile dysfunction
have been reported to occur in up to 40% of patients
after unilateral HA embolization, these symptoms tend
to improve and abate over time.333 Indeed, one of the
largest series of patients undergoing HA interruption
during AAA repair revealed that persistent buttock
claudication developed in 12% of unilateral and 11% of
bilateral HA interruptions, whereas impotence occurred
in 9% of unilateral and 13% of bilateral HA embolizations.334 In addition, the occurrence of these events is
reduced if patency of the internal iliac artery bifurcation remains intact as illustrated in one small study
using an Amplatzer vascular plug (St. Jude Medical, St.
Paul, Minn) to occlude only the main trunk of the
HA.335 A more recent report demonstrated no clinical
difference between coils and plug embolization.336
Despite concerns about prolonged procedural time
and increased amount of contrast material, concomitant unilateral HA embolization during EVAR has been

shown to be safe and effective compared with a
staged approach.337
Bilateral HA occlusion with endograft extension into
both external iliac arteries is occasionally required in
high-risk patients when there is no distal ﬁxation zone
in either common iliac artery or the aneurysm involves
both common and internal iliac arteries. Although antegrade ﬂow into at least one HA should be maintained, if
possible, bilateral HA embolization may be necessary in
some situations. Initial concerns about life-threatening
pelvic or colonic ischemia and neurologic deﬁcits after
bilateral HA interruption during EVAR may have been
overestimated as several recent reports have suggested
that such devastating complications are exceedingly
rare.329,338-340 The risks associated with bilateral HA occlusion are restricted to more severe, persistent, and
frequent
buttock
claudication
and
erectile
dysfunction.341
Technical considerations that may reduce the incidence of adverse events when bilateral HA embolization
is required include a staged approach, embolization of
only the proximal main trunk of the HA, and preservation
of collateral branches from the common and deep
femoral arteries.329,340 An alternative consideration to
avoid bilateral HA embolization during EVAR is open or
endovascular revascularization of at least one internal
iliac artery.342,343 FDA-approved iliac branch graft devices
to maintain ipsilateral internal iliac perfusion have been
developed or are under review.344-346 These devices
have displayed satisfactory early outcomes and should
be considered before embolization in appropriate
circumstances.
With the advent of endovascular repair techniques,
the continued necessity of maintaining pelvic blood
ﬂow has been called into question. Several clinical series have used internal iliac artery embolization as an
adjunct to extend the indications of EVAR in patients
with aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation. Mehta
and associates reported no mortality or increased
morbidity in 48 patients who had interruption of
both internal iliac arteries during open or endovascular
aortic repair.338 However, buttock claudication and
new-onset erectile dysfunction were noted in 42%
and 14% of the patients, respectively. The incidence of
postoperative sexual dysfunction and buttock claudication varies widely in the literature, ranging from 16% to
50% for unilateral and 16% to 80% for bilateral internal
iliac artery embolization, underscoring the difﬁculty of
causal association in the setting of signiﬁcant comorbidities present in the older patient demographic at
risk for AAA disease.347 Several endovascular techniques have been described to preserve internal iliac
artery ﬂow, including the development of commercially
available aortoiliac endografts that incorporate an iliac
branch.348-351

Management of associated vascular disease. Coexistence of other vascular disease with an AAA is common.
Several series reporting observations of aortography have
documented >50% stenosis in 20% to 40% of renal arteries, 10% to 15% of celiac or superior mesenteric
branches, and 20% to 30% of iliac vessels.352,353
The decision to intervene is based on a consideration
of severity of associated lesions, presumed natural history of the diseased vessel and end organ, and anticipated morbidity and mortality risk of combined
repair. Prophylactic treatment of associated asymptomatic renal or mesenteric artery disease cannot be justiﬁed.354,355 The exception may be the patient presenting
with high-grade stenosis of the SMA and a meandering
mesenteric artery that is based off of a large IMA,
which will be sacriﬁced during the course of treatment.
A decision to repair each lesion should be based on its
own individual merits and indications. If endovascular
treatment is judged to be beneﬁcial, it is recommended that it be performed in a staged manner rather
than concomitantly with the planned EVAR procedure.
Iliac and femoral artery lesions may be treated at the
time of EVAR to facilitate endograft delivery and to
correct underlying disease that may be contributing
to lower extremity ischemic symptoms.
Accessory renal arteries are present in 15% to 20% of patients and occasionally may arise from the aneurysm itself.352 Whether an accessory renal artery requires
preservation depends on the size of the artery, its contribution to the renal parenchyma, and the presence of
coexisting kidney disease. Renal infarction after occlusion of an accessory renal artery is common, occurring
in 84% of kidneys, but it is well tolerated in most patients,
without signiﬁcant impact on long-term glomerular
ﬁltration rate.356 Nonetheless, preservation should be
considered for large accessory renal arteries ($3 mm) or
accessory renal arteries providing more than one-third
of arterial ﬂow to the kidney, particularly in the presence
of pre-existing renal dysfunction.357,358

We suggest prophylactic treatment of an asymptomatic, highgrade stenosis of the SMA in the presence of a meandering
mesenteric artery based off of a large IMA, which will be
sacriﬁced during the course of treatment.

Perioperative outcomes of elective EVAR
Incidence of 30-day and in-hospital mortality. The UK
EVAR 1, Dutch Randomized Endovascular Aneurysm
Management (DREAM), U.S. Veterans Affairs Open Versus
Endovascular Repair (OVER), and French Anevrysme de
l’aorte abdominale: Chirurgie versus Endoprothese
(ACE) multicenter randomized trials collectively randomized 2790 patients to EVAR or open repair.359-362 The two
largest trials (EVAR 1 and OVER) demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant mortality beneﬁt with EVAR, and
pooled analysis from all four trials conﬁrmed the beneﬁt
of EVAR with a mortality of 1.4% compared with 4.2% for
open surgery (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.22-0.50; P < .0001).363
A review of 79,932 Medicare patients conﬁrmed that
these results are representative of current outcomes,
with an overall mortality of 5.2% for open repair and 1.6%
for EVAR (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.95-3.51).364 Outcomes after
AAA repair are related to experience. Whereas earlier
studies365,366 suggested that the minimum hospital
threshold for optimal outcomes is 8 to 10 EVAR cases per
year, a recent risk-adjusted analysis of 122,495 Medicare
patients undergoing elective EVAR between 2001 and
2008 observed that operative mortality is directly related
to medical center volume.367 The OR for elective perioperative mortality adjusted for the surgeon’s volume
was lowest for centers that perform at least 30 EVAR
cases per year.
We suggest that elective EVAR be performed at centers with a
volume of at least 10 EVAR cases each year and a documented
perioperative mortality and conversion rate to OSR of 2%
or less.

Perioperative morbidity. Estimated blood loss is significantly lower with EVAR than with open repair.368
Whereas major complications were not different in

34

randomized controlled trials, in a review of Medicare
patients, most major complications were lower with
EVAR, including pneumonia (3.8% vs 12.9%; P < .001),
acute renal failure (4.3% vs 11.3%; P < .001), MI (2.5% vs
5.2%; P < .001), and bowel ischemia (0.6% vs 2.1%;
P < .001). EVAR patients were also more likely to be
discharged to home rather than to a skilled nursing
facility (95% vs 83%; P < .001). The need to convert from
EVAR to open repair decreased over time (2.2% in 2001
to 0.3% in 2008). Median length of stay was 2 days after
EVAR compared with 7 days after open repair (P < .001).
Endoleak. Type IA endoleak is noted in 6% of procedures at the time of implantation and may be due to
mural thrombus, calciﬁcation, angulation, neck tapering,
or excessive graft undersizing or oversizing.369-371 Initial
management is angioplasty with a compliant balloon,
followed by extension cuff placement. Additional
maneuvers include placement of a Palmaz (Cordis,
Bridgewater, NJ) balloon-expandable stent or endostapling.369,372 Conversion to open repair is not recommended unless rupture or signiﬁcant, uncorrectable
device maldeployment is noted. A type IA endoleak may
occasionally resolve after reversal of heparin and no
longer be evident on postoperative CT imaging.373 A
persistent type IA endoleak may be treated by placement of a fenestrated device,374,375 proximal cuff extension with chimney grafts to the renal arteries,376,377
external banding, embolization with coils or glue, or
conversion to open surgery. Insufﬁcient data exist to
recommend a particular strategy. A type IB endoleak is
treated initially by repeated balloon angioplasty and, as
needed, by graft extension. Coil embolization of the HA
may be required when the graft is extended into the
external iliac artery. A type II endoleak is common at the
time of implantation and is observed in 10% to 20% of
patients at 1-month follow-up on CT imaging.378,379
A type II endoleak is not treated at the time of implantation. A type III endoleak is treated by angioplasty of
component overlap sites or by placement of an additional conduit.380 A type IV endoleak is self-limited, and
treatment is not required.
Access site complications. Early experience with EVAR
using open femoral artery exposure was associated with
a high rate of access site-related complications (13%).
These included arterial dissection or perforation (1.4%);
bleeding, hematoma, or false aneurysm (6.6%); arterial
thrombosis (2.2%); embolization (1.1%); wound infection,
skin necrosis, or lymphocele (1.4%); and amputation
(0.1%).381 In a multicenter randomized controlled trial,
percutaneous access was superior to open femoral artery
access with a shorter procedure time (107 vs 141 minutes;
P ¼ .004) and fewer access complications (6% vs 10%;
P ¼ .005), with a 96% technical success rate.314 A systematic review and a recent National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program (NSQIP) review also demonstrated a high technical success rate, shorter operative

time (135 vs 152 minutes), shorter length of stay (1 vs 2
days), and fewer wound complications (1% vs 2.1%; P ¼
.02).382-385 Percutaneous access may not be appropriate
for patients with small vessels, for patients with a high
femoral artery bifurcation, or in the presence of calciﬁcation or a femoral aneurysm. In addition, a history of
prior groin surgery with or without a vascular graft or
patch and obesity may reduce success rates.386-390
Percutaneous access with large sheaths is improved by
ultrasound guidance.386,391-393
Acute limb thrombosis. Early graft limb thrombosis
may occur in 2% of patients because of the placement
of a large limb in a small vessel, iliac tortuosity with graft
kinking, inadequate angioplasty or stenting, arterial
dissection, or injury at the access site.359,360,370,394-396
Postimplantation syndrome. A self-limited inﬂammatory state characterized by fever and elevated inﬂammatory markers may be observed after EVAR as a result
of new thrombus formation within the excluded aneurysm sac.397-401
Ischemic colitis. Colon ischemia due to occlusion of
the IMA or HA or embolization is rare after EVAR
(<1%).334,364,396,402,403 Circumﬂex femoral and circumﬂex
iliac arteries should be preserved should HA occlusion be
planned. Suspected colonic ischemia should be assessed
by endoscopy, and if it is conﬁrmed, antibiotics should be
administered and the patient maintained on intravenous
ﬂuids. Colectomy should be performed if full-thickness
necrosis is suspected.
Role of elective EVAR in the high-risk and unﬁt patient
The EVAR 2 trial compared EVAR with observation and
found no beneﬁt to EVAR for patients who were considered unﬁt for open repair because of a history of MI or
cardiac revascularization, stable angina, valvular heart
disease, signiﬁcant arrhythmia, uncontrolled congestive
heart failure, forced expiratory volume in 1 second <1 L,
or serum creatinine concentration >2.3 mg/dL.309 However, of those randomized to EVAR, only 179 of 197
(91%) underwent surgery; 14 deaths and 9 ruptures
occurred before surgery, which was performed at a
median of 55 days after randomization. Operative
mortality for those randomized to EVAR was 8.4%
(6.4% for elective repair). Of 207 patients randomized to
observation, 70 (34%) crossed over to EVAR; 64 (31%)
were repaired electively, with an operative mortality
of 3%.
Among the many lessons learned from EVAR 2 and
other data, it is evident that there is a subgroup of
patients not ﬁt for open repair who are also at high risk
for EVAR. It is this subgroup that may be identiﬁed using
the VQI risk model and should be considered for nonoperative management. There may also be patients who
although they are at high risk for open surgery are at
reasonable risk for EVAR. In addition, as noted in onethird of patients randomized to observation in EVAR 2,

ﬁtness may be improved by optimization of comorbid
disease to the extent that EVAR may then be considered.
We suggest informing high-risk patients of their VQI
perioperative mortality risk score for them to make an
informed decision to proceed with aneurysm repair.

OSR
Indications. OSR of an AAA continues to be used for
patients who do not meet the anatomic requirements
for endovascular repair, including short or angulated
landing zones, excessive thrombus, multiple large accessory renal arteries, and small and tortuous access vessels
with concomitant occlusive disease. However, fenestrated, branched, and chimney or snorkel grafts have
expanded the range of complex aortic anatomy potentially treatable by EVAR. OSR may be required for treatment of a persistent endoleak and aneurysm sac
growth after EVAR or for treatment of a mycotic aneurysm or infected graft.
Surgical approach. OSR can be performed using either
a transperitoneal or left ﬂank retroperitoneal approach
(Table VII). Indications for each type of approach are
largely based on the patient’s anatomy and comorbidities and the surgeon’s preference. The transperitoneal
approach is typically performed using a generous
midline incision from the xiphoid process to the symphysis pubis. Extension of the incision alongside the xiphoid process releases rectus aponeurosis and facilitates
exposure in the obese patient or in those with more
proximal aortic disease. A minilaparotomy (15 cm) has
been used in select patients. A transperitoneal approach
can be performed rapidly and is versatile, allowing
assessment of intra-abdominal disease and easy access
to the visceral and iliac arteries. Transverse incisions just
above the umbilicus also yield excellent exposure to the
suprarenal aorta and bilateral iliac bifurcations. Proponents of the retroperitoneal approach claim various
physiologic beneﬁts, including signiﬁcant reduction in
ﬂuid losses, cardiac stress, pulmonary complications, and
ileus. However, prospective randomized studies have
generated conﬂicting results.404,405 The measurable
beneﬁts attributed to retroperitoneal exposure were
primarily a shorter duration of ileus and earlier resumption of oral intake. Sieunarine and colleagues reported no
difference in a randomized comparison of transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches for infrarenal
AAA repair, except for higher rates of incisional pain,
bulge, and hernias in the retroperitoneal group.406
The retroperitoneal approach may be preferred for
repair of a suprarenal aneurysm because exposure can
be facilitated by division of the left diaphragmatic crus.
However, in a majority of patients, repair of juxtarenal
and pararenal aneurysms can be performed using a

transperitoneal approach with excellent outcomes.407,408
Although some surgeons routinely ligate or divide the
left renal vein to expose the suprarenal aorta in the
course of using a transperitoneal approach, others do
not.407,408 An important indication for the retroperitoneal
approach is the presence of a hostile abdomen because
of prior intra-abdominal operations, irradiation, incisional
hernia, stoma, or enterocutaneous ﬁstula. In addition, a
retroperitoneal approach can facilitate repair of an inﬂammatory aneurysm or aneurysm associated with a
horseshoe kidney.409,410
We recommend a retroperitoneal approach for patients
requiring OSR of an inﬂammatory aneurysm, a horseshoe
kidney, or an aortic aneurysm in the presence of a hostile
abdomen.

Aortic clamping. Selection of the ideal clamp site and
extent of reconstruction is based on analysis of crosssectional aortic imaging. These features include proximal aneurysm extension; iliac occlusive or aneurysmal
disease; concomitant renal and mesenteric disease;
anomalous venous anatomy; and presence of calcium,
thrombus, or atherosclerotic debris.
The location of the clamp site should take into consideration the proximal extension of the aneurysm as well
as the structural integrity of the aortic wall. Ideally, the
clamp site should be relatively free of thrombus, atherosclerotic debris, or calciﬁcation. Other important considerations include presence of concomitant visceral aortic
disease and unusual venous anatomy, such as a retroaortic renal vein or left-sided vena cava. The aortic clamp
should be placed in the most caudal position possible to
avoid unnecessary renal and visceral ischemia while
allowing a safe anastomosis into healthy aortic wall. For
repair of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm, the clamp is
placed immediately below the level of the lowest renal
artery; the graft is anastomosed to a rim of normal aortic
wall below the level of the clamp. Performing the proximal anastomosis within healthy aorta is important to
minimize the risk of aneurysmal degeneration at or
above the graft.
The transperitoneal approach is typically performed using a midline incision from the xiphoid to the symphysis
pubis or, in select cases, a minilaparotomy incision. After
placement of a self-retaining retractor, the transverse colon is retracted cephalad and the small bowel mesentery
to the right side of the abdomen, splaying the retroperitoneum and aortic aneurysm. The retroperitoneum is

AAA, Abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Adapted from Chaikof EL, Brewster DC, Dalman RL, Makaroun MS, Illig KA, Sicard GA, et al. The care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm:

incised to the left side of the aorta, avoiding the IMA. The
inferior mesenteric vein may need to be divided to avoid
inadvertent traction injury or avulsion by ﬁxed retractors
used to assist in exposing the infrarenal aortic neck.
The left renal vein may need to be mobilized, and if
suprarenal clamp placement is required, division of the
gonadal, adrenal, and lumborenal branches of the renal
vein will facilitate its mobilization. Should division of
the left renal vein be planned to optimize exposure of
the aortic neck, the gonadal, adrenal, and lumbar
branches should be preserved to provide collateral ﬂow
from the kidney. In the presence of signiﬁcant mural
thrombus at the level of the aortic neck, isolation and
temporary occlusion of the renal arteries may be
warranted to minimize the risk of renal artery embolization at the time of clamp placement.
If the aneurysm extends above the renal arteries or
signiﬁcant aortic calciﬁcation is present, it may be preferable to clamp the supraceliac aorta.411,412 Patients in
whom an aortic aneurysm required a suprarenal clamp
have an increased risk of renal dysfunction and morbidity
but similar 30-day mortality compared with those in
whom an infrarenal clamp site was sufﬁcient for repair
of an AAA.407,408,413 Visceral vessel control is not necessary as backbleeding is minimal after supraceliac aortic
cross-clamp application.
The sequence of clamping should begin with the least
diseased segment to avoid the risk of distal embolization. Typically, the iliac arteries are clamped ﬁrst, followed
by the proximal aorta. Distal clamping is always at the
level of the iliac arteries because aneurysm disease usually extends to the aortic bifurcation, even in patients
with planned reconstruction using a tube graft. If the
common iliac arteries are aneurysmal, the external iliac
arteries need to be dissected and controlled separately.
The internal iliac arteries may require balloon occlusion
if external clamping is not feasible.

Systemic anticoagulation with 100 units/kg of intravenous heparin is recommended for elective aneurysm
repair, irrespective of the location of the aortic clamp.
Heparin may be omitted or administered in lower doses
in special circumstances of a ruptured aneurysm or other
unusual situations. In these cases, the graft is vigorously
ﬂushed before restoration of blood ﬂow, or limited
amounts of heparinized saline may be instilled directly
into the distal vessels after placement of the proximal
aortic clamp. In patients with history of heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia, a thrombin inhibitor, such as bivalirudin or argatroban, may be used as an alternative.
We recommend a thrombin inhibitor, such as bivalirudin or
argatroban, as an alternative to heparin for patients with a
history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

Graft type and conﬁguration. There is no signiﬁcant
difference in patency, durability, resistance to infection,
or risk of degeneration or dilation of currently used prosthetic materials. Differences in methods of fabrication of
polyester grafts include knitted or woven, external or
double velour, and high or low porosity. Polyester grafts
can be rendered impermeable by various biologic coatings, including collagen, gelatin, and albumin. Graft
impregnation with silver or rifampin has been used to
enhance resistance to infection. Routine use of
rifampin-impregnated polyester grafts, in which gelatincoated polyester grafts are soaked in rifampin solution
(1 mg/mL) for 15 to 30 minutes, or of silver-impregnated
grafts to limit the risk of device-associated infection has
not proved to be beneﬁcial in prospective or multicenter
studies.414-417

bifurcation, iliac artery, or femoral artery. A tube graft is
preferable when it is feasible because of shortened operative time and reduced blood loss and need for dissection, minimizing risk of inadvertent injury to the ureter,
iliac veins, and autonomic nerves. In the era before widespread adoption of EVAR, approximately 40% to 50% of
patients could be treated with a tube graft.418 In the Canadian aneurysm trial, graft conﬁguration was straight
in 39%, aortobi-iliac in 31%, aortobifemoral in 24%, and
aortoiliac and femoral in 7%.419 Bifurcated grafts are indicated when the distal aorta and common iliac arteries are
aneurysmal, which occurs in one-third of patients.420 In
the presence of iliac aneurysmal disease, the distal
anastomosis should be performed immediately proximal
to the iliac bifurcation to reduce the risk of late
aneurysmal degeneration. Patients with symptomatic
aortoiliac occlusive disease may beneﬁt from distal graft
anastomosis to the distal external iliac or common
femoral arteries. However, graft extension to the femoral
arteries increases the risk of wound infection, limb thrombosis, and anastomotic aneurysm formation.419 Assuming
that normal iliac arteries have been selected for the distal
anastomosis, the risk of progressive distal aneurysmal or
occlusive iliac disease is relatively low.418,421
We recommend straight tube grafts for OSR of AAA in the
absence of signiﬁcant disease of the iliac arteries.

remains a risk factor.422 The IMA is occluded in 40% to
50% of the patients with aortic disease because of ostial
atherosclerosis or mural thrombus. The value of routine
reimplantation of a patent IMA has not been established,
but selective reimplantation may be of value in the presence of compromised pelvic perfusion, particularly when
the marginal artery is interrupted because of prior colectomy.403,423 A prospective randomized study suggested
that IMA reimplantation is beneﬁcial in patients of
advanced age and when intraoperative blood loss has
been substantial.424 Likewise, reimplantation of the IMA
should be considered in patients with underlying celiac
and SMA occlusive disease, particularly in the presence
of a large meandering artery. The IMA can be easily
controlled before opening the aneurysm by a vessel
loop and reimplantation to an aortic graft performed
using a Carrel patch technique, in which a small button
of aortic wall is dissected free from adherent thrombus
and calciﬁc debris. In the Canadian aneurysm trial, IMA
reimplantation was used in 5% of the patients but
was associated with increased risk of postoperative
bleeding.419 Preservation of antegrade ﬂow into at least
one of the internal iliac arteries is recommended whenever possible. For patients treated by OSR, this can
usually be achieved by a distal anastomosis to the iliac
bifurcation, an end-to-side-anastomosis at the external
iliac artery with retrograde ﬂow into the internal iliac
artery, or a separate bypass graft to the internal iliac artery.

Maintenance of pelvic circulation. Perfusion of the
colon, rectum, and pelvis is provided by a complex collateral network from the SMA and IMA through the marginal
artery of Drummond, the internal iliac arteries, and additional collaterals from the circumﬂex iliac and common
and deep femoral arteries. Inadequate pelvic circulation
can lead to sexual dysfunction as well as hip and buttock
claudication. Less frequently, colon or spinal ischemia may
ensue. For example, in the Canadian aneurysm study, the
risk of colon ischemia increased eightfold (0.3% to 2.6%)
when both internal iliac arteries were occluded compared
with when at least one of the internal iliac arteries was
preserved.419,420 Thus, all efforts should be made to preserve perfusion to at least one internal iliac artery.
Colonic ischemia after aortic repair is multifactorial in
origin, but ligation of a patent IMA during reconstruction

We recommend preserving blood ﬂow to at least one HA in
the course of OSR.

Management of associated intra-abdominal vascular
disease. Occlusive disease of the celiac artery and SMA is
present in 10% of patients, whereas renal artery disease
may occur in up to 40%. Because the morbidity and
mortality of aortic repair are increased by concomitant
renal or mesenteric reconstruction, such procedures are
indicated only in the presence of symptomatic disease.
Pearce and colleagues reported a 30-day mortality of
3% among 678 patients treated for AAAs with concomitant renal artery reconstruction.425 However, mesenteric
artery reconstruction combined with aortic reconstruction carries a higher mortality rate and should be
avoided unless it is clinically indicated.426 Thus, should
open AAA repair be required in the presence of renal or
mesenteric artery disease, a staged approach with initial
stenting should be pursued.

Management of associated intra-abdominal nonvascular disease. In the occurrence of an AAA and associated intra-abdominal disease, the most life-threatening
condition should be treated ﬁrst. Simultaneous repair is
avoided because of added morbidity and, in the case of
genitourinary or gastrointestinal procedures, the risk of
bacterial contamination of the prosthesis.
Cholelithiasis is the most common abdominal disease,
with a prevalence of 5% to 20%. Asymptomatic cholelithiasis should be left untreated because the risk of acute
cholecystitis after elective AAA repair is <1%.427 In the
presence of a large aneurysm, treatment of a colorectal
tumor takes precedence in the presence of impending
obstruction, bleeding, or perforation. Otherwise, colon
resection should be delayed for 4 to 6 weeks after AAA
repair.428 Simultaneous resection of ovarian or renal tumors may be considered if a staged minimally invasive
treatment is not feasible.
We suggest concomitant surgical repair of an AAA and
coexistent cholecystitis or an intra-abdominal tumor in
patients who are not candidates for EVAR or staged
intervention.

Perioperative outcomes of open AAA repair
Factors affecting mortality of OSR include the surgeon
and hospital volume, urgency of the procedure, age of
the patient, presence and severity of comorbidities, and
proximal aneurysm extension. Symptomatic coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, severe chronic pulmonary disease, and advanced chronic kidney disease
remain the most important predictors of mortality.364
There has been considerable variation in 30-day mortality rates in the literature, depending on the type of study
reported and its design.429 Elective 30-day mortality for
infrarenal AAA OSR in most contemporary large singlecenter institutional reports has ranged from 1% to
4%.109,430,431 Population-based studies, derived from state
and national databases, indicate higher mortality rates of
4% to 8% across the entire spectrum of hospitals and
health care organizations.34,109,145,419,432-437 Recent multicenter, prospective, randomized trials have demonstrated 30-day mortality of 3% to 4.7%.368,438,439
Analyses of outcomes in Medicare beneﬁciaries indicate
that OSR mortality, although improved in the last
decade, remains higher than that associated with EVAR
for every age category.364 Similarly, the morbidity of

OSR is signiﬁcantly higher compared with EVAR, particularly cardiac, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, and
wound-related complications (Table VIII). Finally, recent
studies have shown that >20% of the patients treated
by OSR require reoperations for laparotomy-related
complications within 8 years.364
The impact of individual surgeon and hospital volume
on outcomes of AAA OSR has been documented in
several studies.145,434,440,441 A review of national Medicare
claims by Birkmeyer and coworkers indicated that 30day mortality was 8% for low-volume hospitals (<17/y)
compared with 4.4% in high-volume hospitals (>79/
y).440 Surgeon volume and prior dedicated vascular
training also affect mortality of OSR. Dimick and associates reported that elective AAA mortality was lowest
when operations were performed by vascular surgeons
(2.2%) compared with cardiac surgeons (4%) and general
surgeons (5.5%; P < .001).442 Using a risk-adjusted analysis, high hospital volume, vascular surgery specialty,
and high surgeon volume were independent predictors
for lower risk of in-hospital mortality after elective AAA
repair. In that study, absolute risk reduction for operations performed in high-volume hospitals and by highvolume surgeons was 30% and 40%, respectively. AAA
repair performed by a general surgeon increased risk of
death by 76% compared with repair performed by a
vascular surgeon.442 A recent risk-adjusted analysis of
122,495 Medicare patients undergoing elective AAA
repair between 2001 and 2008 noted that the mortality
for OSR is directly related to medical center volume.367

The OR for elective perioperative mortality was lowest for
centers that perform at least 18 open repairs and
was <5%.367
Accurate assessment of open surgical expertise and the
applicability of outcome data acquired in the preendovascular era will be areas of concern as the volume
of OSR continues to decline in the United States with
anticipated reduction in the prevalence of cigarette
smoking and expanding options for complex EVAR.
Care should be taken in extrapolating current outcomes
for OSR from data obtained before the widespread availability of endovascular devices.
We suggest that elective OSR for AAA be performed at centers
with an annual volume of at least 10 open aortic operations
of any type and a documented perioperative mortality of 5%
or less.

The patient with a ruptured aneurysm
Preoperative management and considerations for
patient transfer. A ruptured AAA represents a true surgical emergency. Documented rupture, particularly with
associated hypotension, demands immediate transfer
to an adequately equipped operating room for deﬁnitive
repair without delay. Should aneurysm rupture occur,
more than half of patients die before hospitalization or
without treatment.
Establishing a protocol or algorithm for urgent or emergent management of a patient with a ruptured AAA is
essential for optimizing outcomes.443 In the presence of
a protocol, 30-day mortality was 18%, whereas in the
absence of a protocol, 30-day mortality was 32%.444-446
Based on review of the literature, including existing
guidelines endorsed in the United Kingdom447 and by
the Western Vascular Society, an algorithm for the initial
evaluation, diagnosis, immediate management, and
triage of patients with a suspected ruptured AAA is presented (Fig 5). An expedited evaluation consisting of the
airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) protocol, general
assessment, and vital sign check should be initially
performed by the emergency physician of any patient
suspected of having a ruptured AAA. Diagnosis in the
emergency department is usually ascertained on the
basis of history and physical examination. Radiologic
conﬁrmation, either by bedside ultrasound imaging or
a contrast-enhanced CT scan, can be obtained when
an alternative diagnosis is more likely on clinical grounds.
Optimization of the patient’s clinical condition in the
preoperative setting, while waiting for urgent transport
to an operating room, may improve outcomes. Intravenous access should be established with two large-bore
peripheral intravenous lines as central or arterial access
is not immediately necessary. Permissive hypotension,
or hypotensive hemostasis, which refers to restricting

aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation as long as the patient
remains conscious and has a systolic blood pressure
between 70 and 90 mm Hg, should be implemented
to limit excessive hemorrhage.448-450 Laboratory or imaging studies should be obtained only to conﬁrm the diagnosis of ruptured AAA. Other actions that may help
improve outcomes are the immediate availability of
blood and blood products, warming, and avoidance of
elective intubation.451
With the increasing use of endovascular methods to
treat patients presenting with a ruptured AAA, vital
resources, including advanced imaging, trained staff,
and robust endovascular inventory, must be available.
In cases in which transfer is not necessary, the vascular
team should be notiﬁed as soon as a ruptured AAA is
suspected. It may be prudent, however, to transfer a
patient to a higher level facility when such resources
are unavailable.452,453 Patients with good functional status and without severe comorbidity should be transferred without delay. Furthermore, patients who
previously declined elective surgery should be considered for transfer and treatment. Some patients experiencing a ruptured AAA may not be medically ﬁt to
undergo open repair and at the same time are not
anatomically suitable for endovascular repair. The urge
to offer endovascular repair to patients anatomically
unsuitable for such repair should be strongly
resisted.454 Preoperative predictors of death after open
repair include age >76 years, serum creatinine concentration of >2.0 g/dL, pH <7.2, and blood pressure <70
mm Hg at any time. Whereas these risk factors require
more robust validation, when all four are present, open
repair is uniformly fatal.455 As such, goals of care, medical comorbidities, and hemodynamics should be discussed with the receiving vascular surgeon if transfer
is necessary. Ongoing cardiac arrest represents a
contraindication to transfer, given the unlikely survival
of these patients.
Direct physician-to-physician phone handoff is necessary for all patients being transferred. It is imperative
that relevant imaging be transmitted, preferably by an
electronic method.456 Few data exist to guide best management during this critical transfer time. Patients
should receive intravenous nitroglycerin, esmolol,
sodium nitroprusside, and pain medication, as needed,
to avoid hypertension and to minimize the risk of uncontained rupture. Permissive hypotension is appropriate
with limited resuscitation and should be maintained
during transfer. Blood products are preferred to treat
hypotension, but transfer should not be delayed if blood
products are not readily available.457
Systems of care and time goals for intervention.
Timeliness of intervention for the patient with a ruptured
AAA affects outcomes.458-460 A goal of door-to-intervention time of <90 minutes is recommended, with time
zero deﬁned as the time of ﬁrst medical contact and

to a regional center, the adoption of a 30-30-30-minute
framework is recommended as a benchmark. The
initial period denotes the time from ﬁrst medical contact
with a patient suspected of having a ruptured aortic
aneurysm, including immediate management, to the
point when a decision is made to transfer the patient to a
regional center, if so required, or emergent in-house
vascular surgery evaluation is initiated. The second
period represents the time required for rapid transfer to a
regional center, if needed, and includes physicianphysician phone handoff, transfer of images (if available), and in-transit care. The ﬁnal period includes the
time from evaluation by the in-house or receiving
vascular surgery team to arterial access and placement
of an aortic occlusion balloon. Checklists, such as those
highlighting the essential tasks needed to facilitate
transfer, as well as those that assist in coordinating care
teams at the treating facility can be used to help meet
these goals (Figs 6 and 7). More important, and similar to
STEMI management,462,463 the establishment of systems
of care will be necessary. With an organized regional
transfer system, operative repair can be performed in
>95% of patients with a ruptured AAA, with 67%
survival.458 This requires effective coordination between
established sending and receiving facilities with

standardized communication, a reliable transport provider, patient management guidelines during transfer,
and a streamlined process for operative repair. This goal
should be considered the longest time acceptable for
effective management of a patient with a ruptured aortic
aneurysm, and systems that are able to achieve even
more rapid times should be encouraged.
The benchmark of <90-minute door-to-balloon time
for the management of the patient with a STEMI was
initially extremely challenging to meet.461 In 2004, the
National Cardiovascular Data Registry reported that for
patients requiring interhospital transfer, only 8.6% had
total door-to-balloon times of <90 minutes, with a
median time of 152 minutes.464 Nonetheless, the establishment of an ambitious time goal promoted the development of STEMI systems of care to decrease time to
intervention and to improve overall patient survival.463
The challenge faced by rural centers was recognized
when the 2004 ACC/AHA guidelines were issued. However, with rapid triage, transfer, and STEMI treatment
programs, median total door-to-balloon times have
been driven down for rural hospitals from a median of
189 minutes to 88 minutes.465
We suggest a door-to-intervention time of <90 minutes,
based on a framework of 30-30-30 minutes, for the
management of the patient with a ruptured aneurysm.

Initial operative management. Regardless of the
nature of repair, proximal control of the aorta is a crucial
aspect of the initial part of the procedure. Indications for
an aortic occlusion balloon include circulatory collapse,
hemodynamic instability, and anatomic limitations that
prevent expeditious repair.451,466 A femoral artery
approach with use of a long sheath is preferred to a
brachial approach. The sheath may be advanced into the
supraceliac aorta to support the balloon and permit its
removal after endograft placement.466

In the hemodynamically unstable patient without
preoperative CT imaging, evaluation of the proximal
and distal sealing zones and device selection can be
based on intraoperative angiography, recognizing the
inability to assess the extent of mural thrombus, or
ideally intravascular ultrasound. Both bifurcated and
aortouni-iliac endografts have been used for emergent
EVAR.451,467-469 Although it is used less commonly, an
aortouni-iliac device may be helpful in the treatment
of an anatomically challenging AAA. The Nellix Endovascular Aneurysm Sealing System (Endologix, Irvine, Calif)
has also been proposed for treatment of ruptured
AAA.470,471
Role of EVAR. In an effort to improve outcomes for
patients presenting with symptomatic or ruptured
AAAs, the impact of urgent or emergent EVAR has
been recently evaluated. An early randomized trial
comparing EVAR and OSR for ruptured AAAs revealed
that the suitability for endovascular repair was only
46%, but the rate of EVAR was lower (30%).472 Observational studies have revealed improved outcomes after emergent EVAR for ruptured AAAs, but signiﬁcant
selection bias and lack of uniform inclusion criteria and
reporting standards confound these analyses.469 The
Immediate Management of Patients with Rupture:
Open Versus Endovascular Repair (IMPROVE) trial was
a multicenter randomized trial of EVAR and open
repair for patients presenting with a ruptured AAA.473
Patients were randomized before CT imaging was
performed; 316 patients were randomized to EVAR and
297 patients to open repair. The 30-day mortality was
similar among patients treated with EVAR (35.4%) or
open repair (37.4%). Secondary analyses demonstrated
shorter length of stay and a higher proportion of patients discharged to home for those treated by EVAR.
A potential limitation of this study was the application
of an intent-to-treat analysis, which incorporated outcomes for those participants initially randomized to
EVAR but whose anatomy required open repair to the
EVAR group. Recently reported 1-year outcomes
demonstrated that EVAR was most cost-effective
compared with open repair, but no survival beneﬁt
was observed.
An analysis of national trends in the United States
conﬁrms that EVAR is being used with increasing frequency for the treatment of ruptured AAA, with a
decrease in associated mortality.474,475 Outcomes are superior when EVAR for a ruptured aneurysm is performed
in teaching hospitals and high-volume centers.474

If it is anatomically feasible, we recommend EVAR over open
repair for treatment of a ruptured AAA.

Management of postoperative complications.
Abdominal compartment syndrome. Abdominal
compartment syndrome is a well-recognized complication after both OSR and EVAR for ruptured aneurysm
and may occur in approximately 7% of patients.476 Use
of an aortic occlusion balloon, coagulopathy, massive
transfusion, and conversion to an aortouni-iliac device
are all predictors of abdominal compartment syndrome. 477 Abdominal compartment syndrome typically occurs in the hemodynamically unstable patient
with a large retroperitoneal hematoma. Diffuse visceral
edema results in intra-abdominal hypertension and
multiple system organ dysfunction, including oliguria,
increased peak airway pressures, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, hypotension, and decreased cardiac output.
Early recognition and surgical decompression are
necessary to improve survival.478
Ischemic colitis. Colonic ischemia after repair of a
ruptured AAA may occur in as many as one in ﬁve to
one in three patients.479 Ischemic colitis after vascular
surgery has been associated with mortality rates of 45%
to 67%, with recent reports demonstrating only modest
improvement in outcomes.480 Delayed diagnosis, with
advanced ischemic colitis leading to perforation, is
associated with a mortality rate in excess of 90%,481 and a
retrospective review of 222 patients revealed that
ischemic colitis is the most common cause of death after
open repair of a ruptured aneurysm.482 Colonic ischemia
is much less frequent after EVAR than after OSR for
ruptured aneurysm (23% vs 42%), but the risk
remains.403,480,483 Prompt endoscopy is recommended
when ischemic colitis is suspected to conﬁrm the diagnosis and to help guide management.
Multisystem organ failure. Given the associated
hemodynamic instability and ischemia-reperfusion
injury among patients presenting with a ruptured aneurysm, multisystem organ failure may occur in 1% to 3% of
patients after EVAR or open repair.484,485 Once multisystem organ failure develops, organ dysfunction leads to
a prolonged ICU stay, high resource consumption, and a
50% to 70% mortality rate.486 Dedicated ICU teams and
regionalized care at high-volume centers have led to
reduced mortality and decreased length of stay.487,488
Special considerations
Inﬂammatory aneurysm. An inﬂammatory aortic
aneurysm occurs in between 5% and 10% of patients.489
An inﬂammatory aortic aneurysm may not be readily
apparent on CT imaging but may be associated with
retroperitoneal ﬁbrosis490,491 and displays a similar natural history to the more common degenerative aortic
aneurysm.492,493 An inﬂammatory aortic aneurysm is
typically adherent to the duodenum and, less
commonly, the ureters, renal vein, and inferior vena
cava.494 Should open repair be required, a

retroperitoneal approach is recommended to avoid
dissection of the duodenum. A systematic review of 999
patients with inﬂammatory aortic aneurysm conﬁrmed
that EVAR is associated with decreased mortality
compared with open repair.495-500
Horseshoe kidney. A horseshoe kidney occurs in 0.25%
of the general population and in 0.12% of patients
presenting with an aortic aneurysm.501 Preoperative
evaluation requires careful determination of the renal
arterial anatomy, which can be highly variable, with
accessory renal arteries originating from the aorta,
aneurysm sac, and iliac arteries.502-504 If the main renal
arteries are located proximal to the aneurysm, EVAR can
be safely performed.505,506 Small accessory renal arteries
may be covered by EVAR.507,508 In cases with anomalous
blood supply, OSR (preferably through a retroperitoneal
approach), hybrid repair, or fenestrated or branched
EVAR may be considered.509-511 Multiple renal arteries
can be surgically reimplanted using a Carrel patch or
through an inclusion technique.512 Should open repair
be required and CT imaging reveal that the horseshoe
kidney is associated with a thin ﬁbrous isthmus, a transperitoneal approach may be considered with division of
the “isthmus.”513-515 A hybrid approach has been
described using a bifurcated Dacron graft based off the
external iliac artery to revascularize the horseshoe kidney,
followed by EVAR.516,517 Likewise, repair has also been
described using a fenestrated endograft and snorkel
grafts.518,519
Aortocaval ﬁstula. A ruptured aneurysm associated
with an aortocaval ﬁstula has been reported in 0.22% to
6% of patients.520 The triad of abdominal pain, pulsatile
mass, and abdominal “machinery” bruit is present in up to
80% of cases.521-524 Patients presenting with an abdominal aneurysm and high-output heart failure or a paradoxical pulmonary embolism should also be suspected of
having an aortocaval ﬁstula.525-529 Duplex ultrasound imaging will reveal an arterial ﬂow pattern in the inferior vena
cava, and CT imaging will demonstrate contrast material
in the inferior vena cava during the arterial phase.530-533
EVAR is preferred,534-540 with expected resolution of preoperative heart failure and other physiologic disturbances.541-544 If open repair is required, venous bleeding
should be anticipated and care taken to minimize the risk
of pulmonary air embolism or embolism of thrombotic
debris by placement of sponge sticks proximal and distal
to the aortocaval ﬁstula for control, followed by direct suture repair of the defect.545,546
Since 2013, an additional 53 patients presenting with an
aortocaval ﬁstula have been added to the previously
reported 250 cases.547 The majority have been successfully treated with EVAR alone, with occasional use of an
Amplatzer plug548 or additional placement of a covered
stent in the inferior vena cava.549-552

ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS AND
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT
Choice of anesthetic technique and agent. Open
aneurysm repair requires general anesthesia, except in
unusual circumstances, because of the required relaxation of the abdominal wall musculature and need for
wide exposure of the aorta and its branches.553 Insertion of monitoring lines before induction of anesthesia is
appropriate if such monitoring devices improve the
safety of induction. Infusion of an analgesic through an
epidural catheter, by controlling pain ﬁber input, appears
to lower the required dose of general anesthetic agents
and may be associated with a shorter time to extubation.554 In addition, it has been postulated but not proven
that there is decreased hemodynamic lability and cardiac ischemia.555,556 Nonetheless, it has been difﬁcult to
demonstrate signiﬁcant beneﬁt to either intraoperative
or postoperative epidural anesthesia, and traumatic
preoperative insertion of an epidural catheter with
blood-tinged cerebrospinal ﬂuid may preclude subsequent heparin administration and require cancellation of
the operative procedure. Use of epidural anesthesia with
low-dose inhalation anesthesia or in the awake patient
has been advocated for patients with severe COPD.557-559
EVAR can be safely performed under general, epidural,
or local anesthesia. Whereas a number of retrospective
studies suggest that the type of anesthetic inﬂuences
operative time, length of hospital stay, and risk of
morbidity, a mortality beneﬁt has yet to be identiﬁed.
In a retrospective analysis of nearly 4000 patients in the
EUROSTAR registry, local anesthesia was associated
with shorter operative times, reduced ICU admission,
shorter hospital stay, and fewer systemic complications.560 There was a modest advantage of epidural anesthesia compared with general anesthesia. A recent
review of the American College of Surgeons NSQIP database demonstrated that general anesthesia was associated with longer hospital stay and increased
pulmonary morbidity compared with local or regional
anesthesia.561 A meta-analysis of 13,459 patients undergoing EVAR revealed that patients undergoing local anesthesia were older and had more severe cardiac and
pulmonary disease but experienced shorter operative
times and hospital stays and suffered fewer complications.562 A limitation of this review was the inability to account for aneurysm anatomy and morphologic
complexity, which may have inﬂuenced the selection of
general anesthesia for repair.
We recommend general endotracheal anesthesia for patients
undergoing open aneurysm repair.

Anesthetic considerations in the patient with a
ruptured aneurysm. Regardless of the choice of EVAR or
OSR, there is evidence to support the implementation of
a standardized protocol for the efﬁcient evaluation and
treatment of ruptured aneurysm, including anesthetic
management.451,469 Notably, the surgical ﬁeld should
be initially draped and a transfemoral aortic balloon
placed, especially if general anesthesia is required,
because of the likelihood of vasodilation, hypotension,
and cardiovascular collapse. Permissive hypotension to
maintain a systolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg limits
volume overload and appears sufﬁcient to maintain
critical end-organ perfusion.563 The use of local anesthesia for EVAR, most often, does not provide sufﬁcient
pain control for the patient experiencing signiﬁcant
abdominal or back pain.
Antibiotic prophylaxis. A Cochrane review conﬁrmed
that prophylactic antibiotics, administered before incision, reduce the risk of wound infection and early graft
infection in arterial reconstructive surgery.564 However,
continuing antibiotics for >24 hours postoperatively was
without added beneﬁt. There was no advantage among
ﬁrst- or second-generation cephalosporins, penicillins
with lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, or vancomycin. We also recommend that any potential sources of
dental sepsis be eliminated at least 2 weeks before implantation of an aortic prosthesis.
We recommend intravenous administration of a ﬁrst-generation
cephalosporin or, in the event of penicillin allergy, vancomycin
within 30 minutes before OSR or EVAR. Prophylactic
antibiotics should be continued for no more than 24 hours.

Intraoperative ﬂuid resuscitation and blood conservation. Allogeneic blood transfusion remains associated
with immunologic and infectious risks. Although preoperative autologous blood donation avoids disease transmission and transfusion reaction as well as stimulates
erythropoiesis, limitations include limited availability of
blood donation, increased expense, and potential waste
of nonused blood.565 Intraoperative cell salvage assists
in blood conservation, has been recommended if large
blood loss is anticipated, and may be helpful where
concerns of the safety of banked blood exist.566-568 A
prospective randomized trial of cell salvage in elective
cardiac surgery did not lead to a reduction in exposure to
allogeneic blood but did reduce the number of transfused units.569 Various methods of cell salvage, including

use of a cell saver or hemoﬁltration, have not been
associated with meaningful differences in clinical outcomes.570 A Cochrane review of cell salvage used in a
variety of operations demonstrated an overall reduction
of <1 unit per patient with decreased likelihood of
requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion but no alteration in clinical outcome.571 A meta-analysis of cell
salvage in open aneurysm repair conﬁrmed a reduced
requirement for blood transfusion.572 In addition, one
retrospective study has demonstrated that cell salvage is
associated with improved survival among patients
undergoing open repair of a ruptured aneurysm.573 Cell
salvage is contraindicated in the presence of infection or
malignant disease.
The beneﬁt of maintaining a predeﬁned hematocrit
level during OSR of aortic aneurysm is unknown, but
pre-emptive transfusion in the setting of rapid ongoing
blood loss is well supported.574 In the trauma literature,
plasma, platelets, and packed red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio and warm fresh whole blood instead of component
therapy have each been advocated.457,575,576 However,
retrospective studies have not consistently demonstrated a survival beneﬁt to a lower ratio of red cell transfusion to plasma transfusion for patients undergoing
open repair of a ruptured aneurysm.573,577 Furthermore,
withholding plasma and platelet transfusion until surgical repair is complete is not supported by clinical evidence. Optimal blood replacement therapy during
open repair has not been well deﬁned nor indications
established for administration of cryoprecipitate, plasma,
and platelets.578 A retrospective study has suggested
that administration of recombinant factor VIIa in the
setting of intractable intraoperative and postoperative
bleeding during vascular surgery has a survival beneﬁt.579
A Cochrane review of perioperative administration of
crystalloid and colloid ﬂuids for open abdominal aortic
surgery did not identify a superior regimen.580 However,
a recent prospective randomized study of elective open
repair of AAA concluded that a more restrictive perioperative ﬂuid regimen reduces complications and length of
hospital stay.581
We recommend using cell salvage or an ultraﬁltration device if
large blood loss is anticipated.

patients undergoing OSR of an aortic aneurysm.582
However, multiple randomized trials have shown no
measurable beneﬁt to the routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in nonselected patients.583-586 Whereas
transesophageal echocardiography is useful for those
patients “at risk” of major hemodynamic instability or in
the unstable patient to assess volume status and cardiac
function, routine use does not inﬂuence clinical
outcomes.587,588
Perioperative MI is associated with adverse short- and
long-term outcomes and can be prevented by early
recognition of myocardial ischemia.589-592 Electrocardiographic monitoring, using ﬁve leads, is recommended for
both OSR and EVAR. Continuous 12-lead ECG or the
monitoring of two leads instead of a single precordial
lead has been shown to be a more sensitive indicator
of myocardial ischemia.593 However, myocardial
ischemia detection by transesophageal echocardiography in the form of wall motion abnormalities precedes
ST-segment changes and is a more sensitive monitor
for ischemia. Whereas troponin measurement after
vascular surgery has been advocated,594 routine
measurement has not been associated with improved
clinical outcomes.586

Role of the ICU. Increasingly, the care of the postoperative patient is occurring in a step-down unit or other
monitored settings to best focus use of the ICU on those
patients in greatest need.598 Selective use of the ICU after
aneurysm surgery is most effective if preoperative
criteria, such as pre-existing signiﬁcant coronary artery,
pulmonary, or renal disease, or intraoperative criteria,
such as a signiﬁcant arrhythmia, hemodynamic instability, or requirement for postoperative mechanical
ventilation, are established.599 In a study of 230 patients
undergoing aneurysm repair, 89% avoided admission to
ICU by use of systematic preoperative evaluation to
identify predictors of poor outcome.600
Goal-directed therapy using noninvasive monitoring of
cardiac output by esophageal Doppler or lithium indicator dilution and pulse power analysis has been shown to
improve short-term outcomes.601,602 Monitoring cardiac
output with a deﬁned treatment protocol has also
been shown to be cost-effective in the setting of major
abdominal surgery.603 Whereas studies focused on the
care of patients with an aortic aneurysm have not been
conducted, randomized trials have included patients
with vascular disease.604
Fast-track surgical pathways or “enhanced recovery”
pathways are being used increasingly to decrease length
of stay and to expedite discharge after abdominal surgery. Evaluation of a fast-track surgery pathway in a 30patient cohort undergoing open aneurysm repair was
associated with an average length of stay of 3.6 days
without readmission.605 The pathway included a limited
retroperitoneal incision and specialized intraoperative retractors.605 A recent trial conﬁrmed beneﬁt in 101 patients randomized to a fast-track surgery care pathway,
which included no bowel preparation, reduced fasting,
and patient-controlled anesthesia as well as early mobilization and feeding. There was no difference in ICU
length of stay, but time to full feeding (5 vs 7 days; P <
.001) was reduced along with the incidence of postoperative complication (16% vs 36%; P ¼ .039).
We recommend postoperative management in an ICU for the
patient with signiﬁcant cardiac, pulmonary, or renal disease
as well as for those requiring postoperative mechanical
ventilation or who developed a signiﬁcant arrhythmia or
hemodynamic instability during operative treatment.

decompression was associated with a decreased risk of
pulmonary complications without untoward adverse effects.606 Although postoperative malnutrition is uncommon after EVAR, given the anticipated short length of

who undergo open aneurysm repair, particularly those
with pre-existing renal insufﬁciency.608 Early feeding reduces the likelihood of malnutrition, as demonstrated in

Prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis. Early mobilization and shorter length of stay have reduced the incidence of venous thromboembolism after aortic surgery
relative to earlier eras of open aortic repair. Two studies
using the NSQIP database determined that the 30-day
incidence of venous thromboembolism after open
aneurysm repair and EVAR was <2% and 1%, respectively.610,611 The risk of postoperative deep venous
thrombosis after open aneurysm repair was ﬁrst highlighted by Olin and associates, who performed postoperative venography in 50 consecutive patients.612
Although most patients were asymptomatic, 21% had
evidence of an acute deep venous thrombosis, predominantly within the calf veins.
Whereas venous thromboembolism risk stratiﬁcation
can be performed using the Caprini or similar scoring
scheme, most patients undergoing aneurysm repair will
be classiﬁed as moderate (Caprini risk score of 3 or 4) or
high (Caprini risk score >5) risk.613 For example, the majority of patients undergoing aneurysm repair will be 61
years of age or older (Caprini score of 2 points) with
planned surgery of >45 minutes (Caprini score of 2

points). These two factors alone yield a Caprini risk score
of 4. Nonetheless, recommendations for thromboprophylaxis after aneurysm surgery are not well deﬁned,
given the lack of evidence for safety, particularly among
patients undergoing OSR, or effectiveness.614-621
We recommend thromboprophylaxis that includes
intermittent pneumatic compression and early

Postoperative blood transfusion. A threshold for blood
transfusion after OSR or EVAR has not been established. A
number of studies suggest that anemia or a low hemoglobin level is associated with increased mortality after open
AAA repair.110,152 In a review of a statewide database,
transfusion after major vascular procedures occurred in
25% of patients at a median hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL.
Perioperative transfusion was independently associated
with death, MI, and pneumonia.622 A hemoglobin concentration of <7 g/dL has been recommended as a transfusion threshold for a number of high-risk conditions in
both critical and ambulatory care.623 Given the prevalence
of coronary artery disease among patients undergoing
vascular surgery, blood transfusion for a hemoglobin concentration of <10 g/dL has been a common practice.
However, a meta-analysis comparing transfusion thresholds of 7 to 8 g/dL and 9 to 10 g/dL did not discern a difference in outcome for patients undergoing either cardiac or
vascular surgery.624 In this regard, motivated by a desire to
reduce the established risks of blood transfusion, to
decrease blood use, and to lower costs, a recent Cochrane
analysis supported more restrictive guidelines for all patients, including those with cardiovascular disease.625
Therefore, on the basis of currently available evidence, in
the absence of ongoing blood loss, transfusion during or
after OSR or EVAR is recommended only if the hemoglobin
concentration is at or below 7 g/dL.
In the absence of ongoing blood loss, we suggest a threshold
for blood transfusion during or after aneurysm repair at a

pain management, including multimodal techniques
such as central regional blockage with local anesthetics.626 The geriatric population warrants special
consideration, and incorporation of acetaminophen is
recommended in the postoperative pain plan.626
A Cochrane analysis reviewed 1498 patients enrolled in
15 trials who were treated with either epidural or systemic opioid analgesia, most often after open aortic surgery.627 The method of pain control had no impact on
30-day mortality, but initial pain scores, duration of ventilation, postoperative respiratory failure, gastrointestinal
bleeding, ICU length of stay, and incidence of MI were
all reduced among patients treated with epidural analgesia.627,628 Epidural anesthesia may also be beneﬁcial
for patients with COPD.629 Complications after the placement of an epidural catheter are uncommon but include
epidural abscess and hematoma.630
There is limited evidence that a preincisional transversus abdominis plane block decreases the use of pain
medication after major abdominal surgery.631,632
A Cochrane review of eight studies with 358 participants
found that a transversus abdominis plane block reduced
opioid consumption in a subset of studies and had no
impact on nausea, vomiting, or sedation scores.633

POSTOPERATIVE AND LONG-TERM
MANAGEMENT
Late outcomes
Endoleak. Endoleak is deﬁned as persistent blood ﬂow
in the aneurysm sac after EVAR. Endoleaks at the time of
repair may be present in up to 25%.634-636 Although an
endoleak may often resolve without intervention, some
require immediate or delayed treatment to prevent
aneurysm rupture. In addition, some endoleaks develop
months or years after EVAR. Thus, lifelong surveillance
after EVAR is required. An endoleak may be identiﬁed by
CT imaging or duplex ultrasound.637,638 There are four
main types of endoleak.371,639 Management depends on
endoleak type and the associated risk of sac rupture.
Type I endoleak. A type I endoleak occurs when
there is an incomplete seal at the proximal aortic attachment site (type IA) or at the distal iliac attachment site
(IA). A type IA endoleak most often occurs in the presence of a short or severely angulated neck or a reverse
tapered neck or when the attachment site contains
considerable thrombus or calciﬁcation. A type I endoleak
is associated with elevated sac pressure and an ongoing
risk of rupture.640-642

Whereas a small endoleak may seal and can be
observed, it is preferable that when a type I endoleak is
identiﬁed at the time of repair, every attempt should
be made to treat it before the conclusion of the procedure. Balloon molding of the proximal seal zone, placement of a proximal cuff, and endostaples have all been
used with varying degrees of success.643 Endostaples
may reduce the risk of endograft migration and a type
IA endoleak, but long-term data are limited.643,644
Other options for type IA endoleak treatment include
embolization with coils or glue,645,646 proximal extension
with a chimney approach,376 and conversion to a fenestrated endograft.375 A type IB endoleak is treated with distal
extension of the iliac limb if repeated angioplasty fails to
eliminate the endoleak. It may be necessary to extend the
endograft to the external iliac artery with coil occlusion of
the HA. Conversion to open repair should be considered
in the presence of a persistent type IA endoleak.647
Type II endoleak. Persistent ﬁlling of the aneurysm
sac from patent lumbar arteries or the IMA constitutes
a type II endoleak.634-636 Type II endoleaks are the most
common endoleak, present at the time of repair in up to
one-fourth of patients. When a type II endoleak is identiﬁed at the time of the procedure, treatment is not
indicated as at least 50% will spontaneously
resolve.640,645,646,648 The incidence of type II endoleak at 6
months is 10% to 15%.649-651 Factors that increase the risk
of a persistent type II endoleak include a patent IMA,
number and diameter of patent lumbar arteries (especially L3 and L4 lumbar arteries), and ongoing anticoagulation.652-655
The fate of persistent type II endoleaks is variable. Aneurysm sac size may decrease in up to 25%,649,656 remain stable in 50% to 70%,657 or increase in up to 25% of patients.
The delayed onset of a type II endoleak may also be noted
6 months or later after EVAR. A delayed type II endoleak
may be associated with aneurysm sac expansion658; however, expansion in sac diameter >10 mm is uncommon.659
Treatment of a type II endoleak includes embolization of
the IMA or lumbar arteries with coils or glue,646 direct
translumbar injection of the aneurysm sac,639 transcaval
embolization,660,661 and laparoscopic ligation of the IMA
and lumbar arteries,662 all with variable success rates. Up
to 60% of treated aneurysms continue to expand,
requiring multiple procedures and in some cases explantation with conversion to open repair.663,664 Stent graft
preservation with oversewing of the IMA and lumbar arteries from within the sac has been reported.665-667 Type
II endoleak remains a challenge to treat effectively.668
Rupture from a type II endoleak is rare and more often
related to an unrecognized type I endoleak. The decision
to treat is based on the size and expansion ($5 mm) of
the aneurysm, the type and size of patent inﬂow and
outﬂow vessels, and the presence of symptoms.669,670
Selective intervention appears both safe and costeffective.659,671

Type III endoleak. A type III endoleak occurs when
there is incomplete seal between components or
component separation and less frequently is due to fabric erosion. The aneurysm sac becomes repressurized
with an increased risk of rupture. All type III endoleaks
should be treated. When the endoleak is present at the
contralateral gate or between an iliac limb and an iliac
extension, treatment entails bridging the gap with an
appropriately sized limb.640,641
Type IV endoleak. A type IV endoleak is due to fabric
porosity, which may be present at the time of repair. All
type IV endoleaks seal spontaneously and do not require
treatment.
Endotension. Endotension is deﬁned as sac enlargement
without a discernible endoleak. It may be caused by blood
ﬂow that is undetectable at the limits of the imaging modality, pressure transmission through fabric,672,673 or accumulation of a serous ultraﬁltrate across a microporous
fabric.635 Endotension is less common with the newer
generation grafts. Management should be individualized
and may entail observation, relining of low-porosity
endografts, or rarely explantation and conversion to open
repair.

Device migration. Device migration most commonly
presents as caudal migration of the proximal endograft.
A delayed type IA endoleak will occur if the endograft
migrates into the aneurysm sac. Rarely, aortic remodeling will create forces that cause cranial migration of
the distal landing zone and a resultant type IB endoleak.
Device migration is a late event, typically occurring 2
years or more after implantation.674-676 Factors that predispose to migration include hostile neck anatomy,
inadequate device ﬁxation, and progressive aortic dilation and elongation.674,677-679
Treatment for caudal device migration depends on
anatomic considerations, including the quality of the
aortic seal zone as well as the distance between the renal
arteries and the ﬂow divider of the original endograft.
Options include conversion to an aorto-unilateral iliac
bypass with crossover femoral-femoral bypass and iliac
occlusion or placement of an aortic extension cuff. However, the former approach has a lower risk of recurrent
endoleak and rupture because treatment with an aortic
cuff is often associated with continued risk of device
migration.680 Alternatives include proximal extension
with a branched or fenestrated endograft.375 Fenestrated
EVAR for EVAR failure is technically complex because
the existing endograft may interfere with rotational
torque and visualization of the radiopaque markers.
Limb occlusion. Nearly 25% of all arterial reinterventions after open repair are due to limb occlusion, and
they are most common in patients with associated
occlusive disease.681 Limb occlusion appears to be
greater in women and in grafts extending to the femoral
artery. Isolated limb occlusion usually is manifested with
claudication, but occlusion of the entire graft may be
manifested with severe ischemia. On occasion, a patient
may present before complete occlusion of the graft.
Endografts are at a higher risk for limb thrombosis than
bifurcated surgical grafts, as observed in the EVAR 1
trial.682 Endograft limbs can be narrowed by a calciﬁed
small aortic bifurcation or by tortuous, angulated, and
diseased iliac arteries. Although device dependent, the
incidence of limb occlusion after EVAR is approximately
4%, with the majority of occlusions presenting within 2
months and nearly all within the ﬁrst year after
EVAR.394,683,684 Nonsupported limbs are at especially
high risk of limb occlusion.685 However, stented limbs
may also occlude by fabric infolding and kinking between stents.683,686 Whereas the causes of endograft
limb occlusion may be related to a number of factors,
one of the most common reasons is compromised
outﬂow. Occlusion of the internal iliac artery with or
without extension of the endograft limb to the external
iliac artery or unrecognized distal dissection may
increase the risk of limb thrombosis.687,688 Acute endograft limb occlusion often is manifested with worsening
claudication rather than with critical ischemia, provided
the limb has been deployed proximal to the internal iliac

artery, which facilitates collateral perfusion to the lower
extremity.
A stenotic limb, noted on duplex ultrasound or by a
reduction in ABI, can be treated by stent placement. An
occluded limb after EVAR or open repair can be treated
by thrombectomy, pharmacolytic therapy with secondary endovascular or local surgical intervention, or
femoral-femoral or axillofemoral bypass. Mechanical
balloon thrombectomy is less likely to be successful for
treatment of an endograft limb thrombosis because of
difﬁculty in advancing the catheter beyond the occluded
segment, concerns related to dislodging or disrupting the
sealing zones, and the presence of stents, which may
interfere with balloon thrombectomy. The underlying
cause of the thrombosis must be identiﬁed and treated,
and if a mechanical cause for thrombosis cannot be
determined, femoral-femoral bypass should be considered. Simple thrombectomy or thrombolysis will often
lead to recurrent early thrombosis. Five-year patency for
a femoral-femoral bypass graft, when it is placed in the
treatment of aneurysmal disease, exceeds 80%.689,690

Graft infection. All implanted aortic prostheses are at
risk for infection either at implantation or later by hematogenous seeding. Although graft infection is rare with
an incidence of 0.3%,691 historically, it has been the
indication for intervention in up to 25% of redo aortic
surgery.681 Although controversial, the risk of graft infection may be lower after EVAR than after open repair,
perhaps because of delivery of the endoprosthesis
through a completely enclosed system.686,692 However,
the EVAR 1 trial had a comparable incidence of device
infection between EVAR and open repair during a 4-year
follow-up period.682 Similarly, in a recent analysis of
>45,000 Medicare beneﬁciaries, graft infections or aortoenteric ﬁstulas 4 years after EVAR or open repair were
comparable for both groups (w0.3%).86 Likewise, Vogel
and coworkers reported a nearly identical 2-year incidence of graft infection (<0.2%) for OSR or EVAR in a
review of 14,000 patients undergoing aneurysm repair.693
Graft infection after EVAR or open repair may occur in
isolation or with an aortoenteric ﬁstula.694,695
Whereas aortic graft infection presents on average 3
years or later after open repair, endograft infection often

is manifested earlier for reasons that remain unclear.681,696,697 Femoral artery extension of a prosthesis increases the incidence of graft infection from 1% to 3%.698
Other predisposing factors for graft infection include the
need for surgical revision and emergent indication for
initial surgery. Generalized sepsis, groin drainage, pseudoaneurysm formation, and ill-deﬁned pain may be presenting symptoms, and staphylococcal organisms are
the most frequent isolates.699 CT imaging may provide
an initial estimate of the extent of infection, determine
if a pseudoaneurysm exists at the proximal anastomosis,
and assist in operative planning for effective revascularization of the lower extremities.
The conventional treatment of graft infection is staged
excision of all infected graft material with extra-anatomic
reconstruction, particularly in the presence of extensive
contamination and gross purulence.681,700-704 In situ
reconstruction using the femoral vein, a silver- or
antibiotic-impregnated graft, or a cryopreserved allograft
represents an additional surgical option, particularly
appropriate in the presence of minimal contamination.
Placement of a silver or antibiotic prosthetic or PTFE
graft in a grossly contaminated ﬁeld is reserved for the
unstable patient.700,705-709
Treatment of an endograft infection poses unique challenges. A dense inﬂammatory reaction can completely
obliterate natural tissue planes, and endograft hooks or
suprarenal ﬁxation may dictate the need for supraceliac
cross-clamping to explant the device. Furthermore,
hooks and the suprarenal segment may be embedded
into the aortic wall or covered with a pseudointima,
requiring careful removal to avoid injury to the operator
and aortic wall as well as to preserve the aortic neck for
closure or in situ reconstruction. Despite the introduction
of endograft resheathing techniques, attendant renal
ischemia is an established risk. Percutaneous drainage
and antibiotic therapy have been suggested for patients
unﬁt to undergo open repair.696,710-712
An aortoenteric ﬁstula can complicate a graft infection
in 1% to 2% of patients.694,699 Although the duodenum is
most frequently affected, all viscera, including small and
large bowel, have been implicated.695,699 A common presentation is upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as a herald
bleed, which may progress to exsanguinating hemorrhage.713 Any upper gastrointestinal bleeding in a patient
with an aortic graft should raise the suspicion of an aortoenteric ﬁstula. The diagnosis may occasionally be
conﬁrmed by endoscopy or CT imaging.714-716 Bleeding
is more common when the anastomosis erodes into
the gastrointestinal tract, whereas sepsis and abscess formation are more common with paraprosthetic ﬁstula
involving the body of the graft. Treatment strategies are
similar to those for primary graft infections but must
include closure of the visceral defect.717 Whereas endovascular repair of an aortoenteric ﬁstula is uniformly unsuccessful, severe hemorrhage may necessitate the use

of an endograft to temporarily control bleeding as a
bridge to deﬁnitive surgical repair.718,719
Prevention of an aortic graft infection. Recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis after placement of an
aortic prosthesis following OSR or EVAR have historically
followed guidelines for the prevention of infective endocarditis with a prosthetic heart valve. Recent guidelines
have sought to reduce the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis, particularly with the publication of the National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance in
2008, which recommended against antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis, regardless of the dental,
genitourinary, or gastrointestinal procedure or predisposing cardiac condition, including the presence of a prosthetic valve.720 A recent report has observed a small
but statistically signiﬁcant increase in infective endocarditis cases in the United Kingdom since the implementation of the National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence recommendations.721 Although limitations exist in this study and causation has not been
established, concerns have been raised.722 Several
investigations noted a relationship between dental
procedures and infective endocarditis in high-risk
patients.447 Current European Society of Cardiology and
ACC/AHA guidelines recommend ongoing use of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with a prosthetic valve
undergoing high-risk procedures.723,724 High-risk procedures, as deﬁned in both guidelines, include dental
procedures involving the manipulation of the gingival or
periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa, including scaling and root canal procedures.724
Both guidelines noted that there is no compelling evidence that bacteremia resulted from respiratory tract
procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures,
and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures, and
prophylaxis was not recommended for patients undergoing these procedures unless the procedures were
performed in the presence of an infection.724 It was also
strongly recommended that any potential sources of
dental sepsis be eliminated at least 2 weeks before implantation of a prosthetic valve or other intracardiac or
intravascular foreign material, unless the procedure was
deemed urgent. Others have raised concerns that
patients undergoing colonoscopy or urologic procedures, especially the elderly and those with cancer or who
are immunocompromised, require antibiotic prophylaxis.725,726 Both the European and ACC/AHA guidelines
noted that their recommendations were not based on
strong evidence, and further prospective evaluation was
recommended.
For those patients with an aortic prosthesis, whether
placed by OSR or EVAR, we suggest antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent graft infection before any dental procedure involving the manipulation of the gingival or
periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral
mucosa, including scaling and root canal procedures.

We also suggest antibiotic prophylaxis before respiratory
tract procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures, and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures if the potential for infection exists or the patient is
immunocompromised.

numbness in the region of the incision in up to one-third
of patients, as well as bulging of the lateral abdominal
wall with muscle atrophy in 7% to 15%.405,727 Transperitoneal repair is associated with a higher incidence of
late small bowel obstruction, and approximately 10% of
patients may develop a ventral hernia within the ﬁrst 6
years after repair, particularly among those who are
obese.728,729 Should a midline incision be used, continuous suturing technique and avoidance of rapidly
absorbable sutures are recommended.730 Wound
infections of the abdominal incisions are rare (0.4%).729
Para-anastomotic aneurysm. Para-anastomotic aneurysms after aortic aneurysm repair include both false
aneurysms resulting from a disruption of the anastomosis and true aneurysms that develop adjacent to the
anastomosis. True metachronous aneurysms occur at a
greater frequency than anastomotic pseudoaneurysms.
However, the incidence of para-anastomotic aneurysms
is not well deﬁned. Predisposing factors include hypertension, COPD, and tobacco use.731-735 In the era before
CT imaging, Szilagyi and colleagues analyzed a 15-year
experience in which anastomoses at the femoral artery
were at highest risk (3%), followed by the iliac artery
(1.2%) and infrarenal aorta (0.2%).734 Subsequent studies
have reported an incidence after open repair of between
4% and 10% at 10-year follow-up.732 In one study of 511
patients, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a probability of
para-anastomotic aneurysm of 0.8% at 5 years, 6.2% at 10
years, and 35.8% at 15 years.733 This observation has been
conﬁrmed by others, particularly the risk of femoral
pseudoaneurysm formation among patients treated
with an aortobifemoral graft.732,735 Indolent graft infection should be suspected in all pseudoaneurysms.
Given the inability to precisely differentiate anastomotic disruption from degenerative aneurysmal dilation,
indications for repair of para-anastomotic aneurysms are
not well deﬁned. Clearly, large size and rapid enlargement are indications for intervention. Redo open repair
carries a signiﬁcant risk of major morbidity and mortality,
and endovascular repair, where anatomically feasible,
provides a minimally invasive option.736,737 Infrarenal
and fenestrated endografts have been used with chimney as well as snorkeling techniques.738-742
Recommendation for postoperative surveillance
Systematic reviews by the Society for Vascular Surgery
showed a signiﬁcant incidence of postoperative endoleaks up to 5 years after EVAR, which provides rationale
for surveillance. The evidence was insufﬁcient to recommend an optimal frequency of surveillance. Magnetic
resonance imaging was more sensitive than CT angiography and contrast-enhanced CT, although the difference
was small. Duplex ultrasound was inferior to CT and
contrast-enhanced ultrasound in terms of detection rate,
although leaks missed on ultrasound did not require intervention or were not considered to be clinically signiﬁcant.

The goal of postoperative surveillance is to prevent late
rupture and aneurysm-related death. After OSR, an anastomotic aneurysm or aneurysmal dilation in the adjacent
visceral aorta or iliac arteries may occur in 1%, 5%, and
20% of patients at 5, 10, and 15 years.732,735 Thus, abdominal and pelvic CT imaging is recommend every 5 years
after OSR.
Surveillance after EVAR is performed to identify sac
growth, endoleak, device migration, or device failure. A
comprehensive analysis of contemporary Medicare patients revealed that the incidence of late rupture 8 years
after EVAR is >5%.364 Unfavorable anatomy for endovascular repair predisposed to most ruptures, which developed from type I or type III endoleaks with sac
enlargement.743-745
Surveillance imaging modality. Initially recommended surveillance protocols were consistent with those
used by FDA-sponsored pivotal trials, with CT imaging
at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months and yearly thereafter. The 6-month CT scan can be eliminated from
routine surveillance if the 1-month scan shows no concerning endoleak or sac enlargement.746,747
Color duplex ultrasound, contrast-enhanced color
duplex ultrasound, and three-dimensional contrastenhanced ultrasound have all been shown to be accurate in detecting type I and type III endoleaks as well
as sac enlargement.748-752 Ultrasound eliminates radiation exposure, reduces cost, and avoids use of a nephrotoxic contrast agent. Further surveillance with ultrasound
is safe if CT imaging 1 year after EVAR demonstrates no
endoleak and stable sac size747,752 or for those patients
with a type II endoleak and a stable aneurysm size.751 A
new endoleak, graft migration, or aneurysm sac growth
>5 to 10 mm should prompt further evaluation with a
CT scan.
Surveillance outcomes. Surveillance noncompliance
rates approach 60%,753,754 with gaps observed 3 to 4
years after EVAR, particularly among patients of
advanced age, with Medicaid eligibility, or after treatment at a low-volume center.753,755 Although the risks of
late device-related complications and aneurysm rupture
are well documented, population studies have not
demonstrated that annual EVAR surveillance confers a
survival beneﬁt or decreases aneurysm-related mortality.754,756 Not all late ruptures are preceded by endoleak
or sac enlargement, which suggests that not all late
ruptures can be prevented by vigilant surveillance.757,758
Summary. Current recommendations for surveillance
after EVAR include a CT scan at 1 month. Concerning
ﬁndings should prompt surveillance at 6 months. In the
absence of a type I or type III endoleak and sac enlargement, surveillance can be performed with CT or color
duplex ultrasound. Annual duplex ultrasound is most
likely sufﬁcient for routine surveillance in the absence
of new endoleak or sac enlargement. New ﬁndings
should prompt CT imaging to evaluate for type I or

type III endoleaks. Abdominal and pelvic CT imaging
should be performed every 5 years after OSR or EVAR.
We recommend baseline imaging in the ﬁrst month after EVAR

COST AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS IN
ANEURYSM REPAIR
The complexity and intensity of aortic aneurysm treatment result in signiﬁcant costs and resource utilization.
These initial costs include imaging, preoperative risk
management, operating room, personnel, implants, and
recovery. Long-term follow-up and imaging have costs,
as does the treatment of any complications from the
initial procedure or failure of the graft itself. Besides these
provider costs, patients and their families also bear cost
from lost work productivity and out-of-pocket
expenditures.
Contemporary estimates show that in-hospital costs of
treatment for open repair or EVAR are approximately
$40,000 in the United States, with lower cost estimates
in Canada (U.S. $16,000) and other countries.759,760 Implants are a signiﬁcant portion of EVAR costs (34%52%), but these costs are offset by the higher costs after
open repair from longer hospitalization.761,762 Whereas
open repair is slightly more expensive during the initial

hospitalization, no signiﬁcant differences are seen in
long-term follow-up because of the need for surveillance
imaging and reinterventions after EVAR.
Calculating cost of care does not shed light on the
beneﬁt of care. The major beneﬁt of treatment for patients with an aortic aneurysm is increased survival. However, patients endure a decreased quality of life after
surgery, which may be prolonged should a complication
occur. Because EVAR confers a lower complication rate
and smaller incisions compared with open repair, patients undergoing EVAR generally have better healthrelated quality of life within the ﬁrst 12 months, although
there is no signiﬁcant difference beyond the ﬁrst year.763
When cost and effectiveness are combined, costeffectiveness analysis can reveal the value of different
treatment options and also allow comparison to other
treatments in other ﬁelds. Early Markov decision analysis
models show that EVAR is cost-effective compared with
open repair, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
of $22,826.764 However, contemporary Markov models using data from the DREAM,765 EVAR 1,682 OVER,766 and
ACE362 randomized trials showed EVAR to be costeffective on the basis of the OVER trial data, but no difference in lifetime cost-effectiveness was derived from data
generated by the European trials, suggesting that results
may not be generalizable among different countries.767
EVAR also does not appear to be cost-effective for treatment of complicated aneurysms. Cost comparisons for
fenestrated or branched EVAR graft demonstrated higher
costs in comparison to open repair (38,212 vs 16,497)
without signiﬁcant differences in 30-day mortality.768
Most of the data for cost-effectiveness pertain to elective cases, for which expected morbidity and mortality
can be managed through selection of patients and preparation. In the urgent and emergent situation, morbidity
and mortality risk is higher, leading to higher costs and
lower quality of life. Nevertheless, evidence suggests
that EVAR in the acute setting is favorable.769
A single screening ultrasound for AAA in asymptomatic
men older than 65 years has been shown to be costeffective in the United Kingdom261 and through Markov
modeling.770 In the United Kingdom, the cost per lifeyear saved with screening was $1173, which is less costly
than screening programs for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer.771 The cost-effectiveness of screening for
younger cohorts, women, and reimaging intervals for
small aneurysms remains uncertain. Early treatment of
a small aneurysm, <5 cm in diameter, is not costeffective in comparison to serial imaging.772
Because of the lower perioperative complication rates
with EVAR, patients who could not undergo open repair
are being offered EVAR or hybrid procedures. In the
setting of constrained costs and capitated care, expensive procedures for asymptomatic elderly patients with
signiﬁcant comorbidities who will not derive a meaningful survival beneﬁt are not cost-effective.

Volume 67, Number 1

EVAR implants are a major component of costs of treatment. As additional devices have been introduced to the
market, it had been speculated that competition would
lower price and incentivize further innovation. However,
a decrease in device cost has not been observed. Several
institutions have reported that EVAR confers a negative
operating margin in Medicare beneﬁciaries.773,774
Whereas cost-effectiveness results can vary among
different populations of patients and health care systems
and over time, the factors that inﬂuence cost and outcomes remain consistent. In a future of rising costs and
constrained resources, cost-effectiveness analysis will
provide a basis to guide health care policy that sustains
health care coverage for all.

CARE OF THE PATIENT WITH AN AAA: AREAS IN
NEED OF FURTHER RESEARCH
Advances in biotechnology, drug discovery, and the engineering sciences hold signiﬁcant promise for the development of new diagnostic tests, bioactive compounds,
and intraoperative tools and devices that will enhance
the care of the patient with an aortic aneurysm. Research
is needed (1) to ascertain genetic or other biologic factors
that accurately measure the lifelong risk for development of an aortic aneurysm; (2) to discover pharmacologic agents to limit aneurysm enlargement; (3) to
characterize biomarkers or imaging-derived determinants of rupture risk; (4) to design prostheses that resist
infection and thrombosis; (5) to develop tools, intraoperative imaging or robotic systems, and improved endovascular grafts that facilitate repair in the presence of
challenging anatomy and improve the safety and accuracy of device deployment; and (6) to identify approaches that reliably treat type I and type II
endoleaksdall within the framework of enhancing
cost-effective care.
A number of areas of uncertainty also exist in the care of
patients with an AAA in the application of existing technology that would beneﬁt from further investigation.
Furthermore, given the role of sex differences in the
pathophysiologic process and outcomes of AAA, investigations in cells, animals, and humans should be
designed to assess for gender and should clearly state
related study population details so that results can be
interpreted appropriately. Whereas the following list is
not meant to be comprehensive, future research efforts
should consider addressing these topics:
What is the most cost-effective and clinically effective
surveillance protocol for the patient with a small
aneurysm?
d Should the aortic size index replace aortic diameter as
a determinant for recommending aneurysm repair?
d Do female patients beneﬁt from a reﬁned metric, such
as the aortic size index, or size threshold for recommending repair?
d

Which quality and volume metrics best identify centers
that should engage in either EVAR or OSR of an aortic
aneurysm?
d Does use of a perioperative mortality risk scoring
scheme provide beneﬁt in patient and family communication and mutual decision-making?
d Does a perioperative mortality risk scoring scheme
provide utility to surgeons, patients, and families in
guiding recommendations for repair in the high-risk
patient?
d Can perioperative mortality risk scoring schemes be
further reﬁned to enhance their predictive ability?
d Does a frailty assessment enhance our ability to identify those patients who will not beneﬁt from aneurysm
repair?
d Can a single risk-beneﬁt scoring scheme be developed
that incorporates risk of repair, risk of aneurysm
rupture, and anticipated life expectancy?
d Would a risk-beneﬁt scoring scheme that incorporates
risk of repair, risk of aneurysm rupture, and anticipated
life expectancy assist in mutual decision-making between the surgeon, the patient, and the patient’s family?
d Will a deﬁned system of care and associated time
benchmark from ﬁrst medical contact to intervention
improve outcomes for the patient with a ruptured
aneurysm?
d Which
factors are most important in optimizing
patient outcomes within a system of care for the treatment of a ruptured aneurysm?
d Is prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis needed for
the patient undergoing EVAR?
d Does the patient undergoing OSR and at low or moderate risk for deep venous thrombosis beneﬁt from
heparin prophylaxis?
d What is the optimal hemoglobin level that necessitates
transfusion in the stable postoperative patient without
ongoing blood loss?
d What is the optimal interval, imaging modality, and
duration for postoperative surveillance after aneurysm
repair?
d What is the most cost-effective and clinically effective
surveillance protocol for the patient after EVAR?
