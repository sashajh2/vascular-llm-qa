ABSTRACT
Background: To support the development of guidelines on the management of carotid disease, a writing committee
from the Society for Vascular Surgery has commissioned this systematic review.
Methods: We searched multiple data bases for studies addressing ﬁve questions: medical management vs carotid
revascularization (CEA) in asymptomatic patients, CEA vs carotid artery stenting (CAS) in symptomatic low surgical risk
patients, the optimal timing of revascularization after acute stroke, screening high-risk patients for carotid disease, and
the optimal sequence of interventions in patients with combined coronary and carotid disease. Studies were selected
and appraised by pairs of independent reviewers. Meta-analyses were performed when feasible.
Results: Medical management compared with carotid interventions in asymptomatic patients was associated with
better early outcome during the ﬁrst 30 days. However, CEA was associated with signiﬁcantly lower long-term rate of
stroke/death at 5 years. In symptomatic low-risk surgical patients, CEA was associated with a lower risk of stroke, but a
signiﬁcant increase in myocardial infarction compared with CAS during the ﬁrst 30 days. When the long-term outcome of
transfemoral CAS vs CEA in symptomatic patients were examined using preplanned pooled analysis of individual patient
data from four randomized trials, the risk of death or stroke within 120 days of the index procedure was 5.5% for CEA and
8.7% for CAS, which lends support that, over the long term, CEA has a superior outcome compared with transfemoral
CAS. When managing acute stroke, the comparison of CEA during the ﬁrst 48 hours to that between day 2 and day 14 did
not reveal a statistically signiﬁcant difference on outcomes during the ﬁrst 30 days. Registry data show good results with
CEA performed in the ﬁrst week, but not within the ﬁrst 48 hours. A single risk factor, aside from peripheral artery disease,
was associated with low carotid screening yield. Multiple risk factors greatly increase the yield of screening. Evidence on
the timing of interventions in patients with combined carotid and coronary disease was sparse and imprecise. Patients
without carotid symptoms, who had the carotid intervention ﬁrst, compared with a combined carotid intervention and
coronary artery bypass grafting, had better outcomes.
Conclusions: This updated evidence summary supports the Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for
commonly raised clinical scenarios. CEA was superior to medical therapy in the long-term prevention of stroke/death
over medical therapy. CEA was also superior to transfemoral CAS in minimizing long-term stroke/death for symptomatic
low risk surgical patients. CEA should optimally be performed between 2 and 14 days from the onset of acute stroke.
Having multiple risk factors increases the value of carotid screening. (J Vasc Surg 2022;75:99S-108S.)

Extracranial carotid artery disease occurs owing to
progression of atheromatous plaque which mainly affects the carotid bifurcation, and results in narrowing
or blockade of the arterial lumen. This can be an
asymptomatic process and found incidentally, or the
patient may present with an ischemic stroke or

transient ischemic attack. Stroke is one of the leading
causes of morbidity, disability and mortality. It is the
cause for about 140,000 deaths each year in the
United States.1 Poststroke care in the United States is
a huge economic burden and can reach $4850 per
patient month.2

Three main therapeutic strategies exist for patients with
carotid artery disease, including medical management,
carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting
(CAS). Medical management is recommended in all
cases (with CEA, CAS, or alone) and includes antiplatelet
medications (aspirin, dipyridamole, ticlopidine, and
clopidogrel), high-potency statins, oral diabetic medication or insulin, hypertensive medications, smoking cessation, and lifestyle modiﬁcations.
Controversies and debates exist on various aspects of
the management of carotid disease, starting with
knowing which patients should be screened for carotid
disease. In terms of treatment, an important question is
under which circumstances to use these treatment
options, particularly as it relates to whether the patient
is symptomatic or not. The issue of optimal timing of carotid intervention after acute stroke is equally important.
In patients with combined coronary and carotid disease,
the optimal sequence for intervention is also unclear.
The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) has determined
this topic to be in need for updated clinical practice
guidelines and identiﬁed several decision-making
dilemmas that patients and surgeons face in practice.
To support the guideline development process and summarize the evidence base, we conducted this systematic
review and meta-analysis.

METHODS
This report was written in accordance with the PRISMA
statement.3 The speciﬁc questions of this review and the
explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed
by a committee from the SVS charged with developing
clinical practice guidelines on the management of carotid disease.
Eligibility criteria. The committee prioritized ﬁve questions, which are presented using the PICO format (patient, intervention, comparison, outcomes) along with
the eligibility criteria in the Table. The ﬁve questions
addressed medical management vs carotid revascularization (CEA) in asymptomatic patients, CEA vs CAS in
symptomatic low surgical risk patients, the optimal
timing of revascularization after acute stroke, screening
high-risk patients for carotid disease, and the optimal
sequence of interventions in patients with combined
coronary and carotid disease.
Data sources and search strategies. The search strategy ﬁrst identiﬁed existing systematic reviews to determine the feasibility and the approach for the project.
When a high credibility review was identiﬁed, we
updated the review. Dedicated searches for original
studies were then designed for each question. The databases included MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central

Journal of Vascular Surgery

Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus. Searches were completed
in August 2019 for questions 1 and 3, and in July 2019 for
questions 2, 4, and 5. The search strategy was designed
and conducted by medical reference librarians with
input from the investigators. Controlled vocabulary supplemented with key words was used to search for studies
of interest without language restrictions. The actual strategy listing all search terms used and how they are combined is available in the Appendix (online only).
Study selection and data extraction. Studies obtained
by the search strategies, reference mining of systematic
reviews, and those suggested by the committee were
reviewed independently by two reviewers. We ﬁrst
reviewed abstracts and in a second phase we reviewed
full-text articles if included or had a conﬂict at the abstract level. Data from included studies were abstracted
by pairs of independent reviewers using different standardized piloted Excel sheets for each question. Disagreements were resolved via consensus.
We extracted data on patient characteristics (eg number of patients, mean age, gender, mean body mass index, comorbidities, and details of medical therapy) and
outcomes of interest (stroke, ipsilateral stroke, death,
myocardial infarction [MI], cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral hyperperfusion, and prevalence of >50% carotid
stenosis).
Methodologic quality and certainty of the evidence.
The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed by
two independent reviewers. This task was carried out using a standardized form based on the Newcastle Ottawa
scale for observational studies4 and the Cochrane tool for
risk of bias assessment of randomized controlled trials
(RCTs).5 For uncontrolled studies, we used an adaptation
of the Newcastle Ottawa scale.6 Any discrepancy between a pair of reviewers was solved by consensus or by a
third reviewer. We rated the certainty of evidence using
the GRADE approach7 as adapted by the SVS.8,9 We
considered an estimate to be imprecise if its conﬁdence
interval (CI) overlapped both, beneﬁts and harms.10
Statistical analysis. For comparative studies, we calculated the relative risk (RR) from each study and estimated the 95% CI and pooled across studies using the
DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. For noncomparative studies, an overall event rate was calculated
and transformed using the Freeman-Tukey arcsine
method, and pooled using the DerSimonian and Laird
random effects model. The random effects model was
chosen a priori because of anticipated heterogeneity
across study populations and settings. Heterogeneity
was evaluated using the I2 index and Cochrane Q test. All
statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.1
(The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria).

RESULTS
Study selection
We reviewed 5935 citations and 898 systematic reviews.
The study selection process for the ﬁve questions is
depicted in the Supplementary Figure (online only). We
ﬁnally included 96 studies (question one, 6 studies11-16;
question two, 9 RCTs17-25; question three, 8 studies26-33;
question four, 47 studies34-80; and question ﬁve, 26
studies81-106). A detailed description of the included
study characteristics for each of the questions and their
risk of bias is available in Supplementary Tables II and
III, (online only) respectively.
Question 1: Medical management vs CEA in asymptomatic patients
We included four RCTs and two observational studies.
Most of the studies had a low risk of bias based on each
corresponding bias assessment tool. One RCT13 had a
moderate risk of bias owing to lack of blinding of outcome
assessors. The studies reported on 5498 patients (mean
age, 70 years; 67% males) with a varying prevalence of
comorbidities (commonly coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia). Patients in all studies
received aggressive medical treatment following up-todate national and international guidelines. Those treatments were focused on antiplatelet therapy, antihypertensive therapy, and lipid-lowering therapy.
Thirty-day outcomes. Medical management was associated with a signiﬁcant decrease in strokes and combined stroke/death at 30 days compared with CEA (3
studies; RR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08-0.87 [Supplementary
Table I, online only], and RR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.11-0.53
[Supplementary Table I, online only], respectively). Certainty in evidence was moderate, reduced owing to
methodologic limitations.
Mortality estimate was highly imprecise to derive conclusions (3 studies; RR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.00-33.71)
(Supplementary Table I, online only). The estimate for
the outcome of MI and ipsilateral stroke was highly
imprecise to derive conclusions. Certainty in evidence
was very low, decreased owing to methodologic limitations and severe imprecision.
Outcomes at longest follow-up. Kolos et al 201512
demonstrated that, at the 3.3-year follow-up, medical
therapy was associated with signiﬁcantly higher risk of
stroke/death (RR, 5.81; 95% CI, 1.38-24.45; Supplementary
Table I, online only). After 5 years of follow-up, medical
therapy was associated with a higher risk of stroke (ACST
200411) (RR, 2.86; 95% CI, 2.02-4.03; Supplementary
Table I, online only) and ipsilateral stroke (ACST 200411)
(RR, 4.77; 95% CI, 2.63-8.64) (Supplementary Table I,
online only). Certainty in these estimates was moderate
to high. The estimates for the outcomes of death, stroke,
stroke/death, MI, and ipsilateral stroke at the 1-year
follow-up were reported by Reiff et al13 and were highly

imprecise to derive conclusions. A meta-analysis was not
feasible on stroke outcomes owing to the heterogeneity
of reporting and follow-up durations.
Howard et al107 conducted a systematic review and
meta-analysis that analyzed the correlation between
the degree of asymptomatic carotid stenosis and ipsilateral stroke in patients treated with contemporary
best medical therapy. The ipsilateral stroke rate was
signiﬁcantly greater for patients with 80% to 99% carotid stenosis than those with 50% to less than 80%
stenosis (18% vs 1%; P < .0001). Patients with 70% to
99% carotid stenosis had a higher risk of ipsilateral
stroke than those with 50% to less than 70% stenosis
(P < .0001). These studies suggest that the beneﬁt of
CEA might be underestimated in patients with severe
stenosis (>70%).107
Question 2: CEA vs CAS in symptomatic low risk surgical
patients
We included nine RCTs (published in 25 different publications). Four RCTs had a low overall risk of bias, three
had a moderate risk of bias mainly owing to lack of blinding of outcome assessors, and two had a high risk of bias
owing to a lack of blinding of outcome assessors, and
inadequate random sequence generation, allocation
concealment and possible selective reporting. The
studies reported on 5486 patients (mean age, 69 years;
75% males). The most common comorbidities in this
group of patients are hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and
coronary artery disease.
Outcomes at 30 days. CEA was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in stroke and a signiﬁcant increase in
the risk of MI at 30 days compared with CAS (7 studies;
RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.42-0.86; Fig 1) and (6 studies; RR,
2.15; 95% CI, 1.27-3.61; Fig 2), respectively. Certainty in evidence was high.
Estimates were highly imprecise to derive conclusions
about the outcomes of death, ipsilateral stroke and
death/stroke at 30 days (8 studies; RR, 0.63; 95% CI,
0.31-1.29; Supplementary Table I, online only), (4 studies;

only), and (4 studies; RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.38-1.24;
Supplementary Table I, online only), respectively. Certainty in evidence was very low, reduced owing to methodologic limitations and severe imprecision.
Outcomes at 5 years. When the long-term outcome of
transfemoral CAS vs CEA in symptomatic patients were
examined using a preplanned pooled analysis of individual patient data from four randomized trials,108 the
risk of death or stroke within 120 days of the index procedure was 5.5% (4.7%-6.5%) for CEA and 8.7% (7.6%9.9%) for CAS. The primary event outcome and ipsilateral
postprocedural stroke at 5 years was 8.3% (7.25%-9.6%)
for CEA vs 11.4% (10.1%-12.8%) for CAS (Supplementary
Table I, online only).
Question 3: Timing of intervention in stroke
We included seven observational studies and one RCT.
As for the observational studies, three of them had an
overall low risk of bias and four had a moderate risk of
bias mainly because of inadequate follow-up and inadequate comparability of cohorts baseline prognostic factors. The one RCT had an overall moderate risk of bias
owing to unclear random sequence generation and
lack of blinding of outcome assessors. The studies reported on 9882 patients (mean age, 70 years; 63% males).
Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were the most
common comorbidities.
Outcomes at 30 days. A meta-analysis did not show a
statistically signiﬁcant difference in death and cerebral
hemorrhage at 30 days between CEA performed at less
than 2 days vs 2 to 14 days (3 studies; RR, 1.23; 95% CI,
0.48-3.17; Supplementary Table I, online only) and (2
studies; RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.00-13096.54; Supplementary
Table I, online only). However, the results of the two
larger series suggest worse outcomes with early intervention (<2 days). The study by Tanious et al17 showed
that the risk of cerebral hyperperfusion was numerically
higher in patients who had CEA in less than 2 days vs 2 to
14 days (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.34-7.84; Supplementary Table I,

online only). In the series by Avgerinos et al, stroke rate
was nonsigniﬁcantly higher in patients who had CEA in
less than 2 days vs those who had CEA in 2 to 5 days (RR,
1.80; 95% CI, 0.74-4.39; Supplementary Table I, online
only) and it was statistically signiﬁcantly higher in patients with less than 2 days vs more than 6 days (RR, 4.16;
95% CI, 1.62-10.67; Supplementary Table I, online only).
Similarly, Avgerinos et al25 showed that death was
nonsigniﬁcantly higher in patients who had CEA in less
than 2 days vs more than 6 days (RR, 2.97; 95% CI, 0.2732.48; Supplementary Table I, online only). Other registry/
Vascular Quality Initiative data have shown good results
with CEA performed in the ﬁrst week, but not within the
ﬁrst 48 hours.31,109-111 Multivariate analysis of Vascular
Quality Initiative data demonstrated that when performing CEA between 3 and 7 days after a stroke, compared
with ﬁrst 48 hours after a stroke, was protective for postoperative complication (P ¼ .028) and postoperative
stroke/death (P ¼ .003). No signiﬁcant differences were
noted for CAS outcomes when performed less than 2 days
vs between 2 and 14 days. Other outcomes and outcomes
related to other time points are available in
Supplementary Table I, (online only). Certainty in evidence
was very low in all these outcomes, decreased owing to
methodologic limitations and severe imprecision.
Question 4: Screening high-risk patients
We included 47 observational studies, most of which
were single-arm noncomparative studies. Thus, they
were evaluated on the following domains: representativeness of study population, ascertainment of exposure,
length of follow-up and adequacy of follow-up. Nine
studies had an overall low risk of bias, 10 had a high
risk, and 28 had a moderate risk of bias. The studies

reported on 32,641 patients (mean age, 65 years; 71%
males). Patients had hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral artery disease, coronary artery
disease, and diabetes.
The yield of screening for carotid stenosis (deﬁned as
the presence of >50% stenosis) stratiﬁed by various
risk factors is depicted in Fig 3. The highest yield was
for a combination of diabetes, coronary artery disease,
and renal failure (47%; 95% CI, 29%-65%), followed by
coronary artery disease and renal failure (43%). Having
a single risk factor such as isolated hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or diabetes was associated with low yield
(2%, 2%, and 3%, respectively), whereas peripheral artery disease alone was associated with a yield of 18%.
The certainty in the yield of screening outcome is likely
to be moderate or high.
Comparative studies did not show a statistically signiﬁcant difference between the screened and unscreened
populations in terms of death or stroke (2 studies; RR,
0.38; 95% CI, 0.00-1432.82; Supplementary Table I, online
only) and (2 studies; RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.00-1024.93;
Supplementary Table I, online only); respectively. Certainty
in evidence was very low owing to severe imprecision.
Question 5: Optimal sequence for carotid intervention
in patients with combined carotid and coronary disease
We included 26 studies, 2 of which were RCTs and 24
were observational studies. One RCT had a low risk of
bias, and the other one had a moderate risk owing to
unclear blinding of outcome assessors. Ten of the
observational studies had a low overall risk of bias
and 14 had a moderate risk of bias. The studies reported on 53,577 patients (mean age, 70 years; 72%
males). Common comorbidities were hypertension,

hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, a history of MI, and
smoking.
Carotid endarterectomy.
Combined CEA and coronary artery bypass grafting
vs coronary artery bypass grafting ﬁrst. Estimates were
highly imprecise to derive conclusions about the outcomes of death (10 studies; RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.32-1.05;
Supplementary Table I, online only), stroke (9 studies;
RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.34-2.22; Supplementary Table I, online
only), and MI (9 studies; RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.09-4.34;
Supplementary Table I, online only). Other outcomes are
shown in Supplementary Table I, (online only).
Combined CEA and coronary artery bypass grafting
vs CEA ﬁrst. Estimates were highly imprecise to derive
conclusions about the outcomes of death (17 studies;
RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.78-2.29; Supplementary Table I,
online only), stroke (16 studies; RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.30-1.72;
Supplementary Table I, online only), MI (14 studies; RR,
0.85; 95% CI, 0.45-1.62; Supplementary Table I, online
only), and combined death/stroke (2 studies; RR, 1.46;
95% CI, 0.06-38.22; Supplementary Table I, online only).
Coronary artery bypass grafting ﬁrst vs CEA ﬁrst. Estimates were highly imprecise to derive conclusions about
the outcomes of death (8 studies; RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.442.01; Supplementary Table I, online only), stroke (7
studies; RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.64-3.06; Supplementary
Table I, online only), and MI (8 studies; RR, 0.51; 95% CI,
0.22-1.18; Supplementary Table I, online only).
Carotid artery stenting.
Combined coronary artery bypass grafting and CAS
vs CAS ﬁrst. Estimates were highly imprecise to derive
conclusions about the outcome of death (2 studies; RR,
4.62; 95% CI, 0.72-29.87; Supplementary Table I, online
only). Other outcomes are presented in Supplementary
Table I, online only.
Asymptomatic carotid disease. We evaluated in sensitivity analyses cohorts of asymptomatic carotid stenosis.
The majority of patients included in this analysis had
combined CEA and coronary artery bypass grafting
(CABG) compared with CEA ﬁrst. The combined
approach compared with the carotid intervention ﬁrst
was associated with a signiﬁcant increase in stroke (4
studies; RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.16-1.73; Supplementary Table I,
online only) and in death/stroke (2 studies; RR, 1.28; 95%
CI, 1.10-1.49; Supplementary Table I, online only). There
was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in death (4
studies; RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.23-10.31; Supplementary
Table I, online only). Supplementary Table I, (online
only) outlines the outcomes for comparing a combined
approach in this subgroup to the patients in whom
CABG was done ﬁrst. The exclusion of mixed series (in
which the carotid intervention was CAS or CEA) provides
the same conclusions.
Symptomatic carotid disease. We evaluated in sensitivity analyses cohorts of symptomatic carotid stenosis
in which patients were treated with a combined CEA

and CABG approach vs CABG ﬁrst (ie, no CAS studies). Estimates were highly imprecise to derive conclusions
about all outcomes. The results are summarized in the
Supplementary Table I, (online only). Certainty in evidence was very low in all these outcomes that relate to
intervention timing, reduced owing to methodologic
limitations and severe imprecision.
Data suggests CEA before or concomitant with CABG in
symptomatic patients with signiﬁcant carotid stenosis of
50% to 99%, who require both CABG and CEA, to potentially lower risk of stroke and stroke/death. Meanwhile, for
patients who have severe asymptomatic stenosis or
contralateral occlusion or severe (70%-99%) bilateral
asymptomatic carotid stenosis CEA before or concomitant with CABG is preferable.

DISCUSSION
Main ﬁndings. This systematic review addressed ﬁve
important dilemmas that patients and surgeons face in
daily practice. In brief, medical management compared
with carotid interventions (CEA) in asymptomatic patients was associated with better early outcome during
the ﬁrst 30 days. However, CEA was associated with
signiﬁcantly better stroke/death rates in the long-term
at 5 years. In symptomatic low surgical risk patients,
CEA was associated with lower risk of stroke, but a signiﬁcant increase in MI compared with CAS during the
ﬁrst 30 days. The long-term outcome of transfemoral CAS
vs CEA in symptomatic patients suggests that the risk of
death or stroke within 120 days of the index procedure
was higher for CAS. The primary event outcome and
ipsilateral postprocedural stroke at 5 years was also
higher for CAS, which lends support that, over the long
term, CEA has superior outcome than transfemoral CAS.
When managing acute stroke, the comparison of CEA
during the ﬁrst 48 hours to that between day 2 and day
14 did not reveal a statistically signiﬁcant difference on
outcomes during the ﬁrst 30 days. Although we did not
ﬁnd comparative evidence to support screening for carotid disease (ie, screening vs no screening), we were able
to stratify patients based on risk factors and provide estimates of screening yield. These estimates will be highly
relevant for shared decision-making. A single risk factor,
aside from peripheral artery disease, was associated with
low yield. Multiple risk factors greatly increase the yield of
screening and can justify a screening recommendation.
Evidence on the timing of interventions in patients with
combined carotid and coronary disease was sparse and
imprecise. Patients without carotid symptoms who had
the carotid intervention ﬁrst, compared with a combined
carotid intervention and CABG, had better outcomes.
Clinical implications. This systematic review/metaanalysis analyzes ﬁve important clinical questions/issues
in the management of extracranial carotid artery disease:
medical management vs CEA in asymptomatic patients,

CEA vs CAS in symptomatic low risk surgical patients,
timing of intervention in stroke, screening high risk patients, and the optimal sequence for carotid intervention
in patients with combined carotid and coronary disease.
The recommendations are addressed in a separate
document, “Society for Vascular Surgery Clinical Practice
Guidelines for Management of Extracranial Cerebrovascular Disease.”112 Furthermore, a separate comprehensive
implementation document will address these issues in
further details and cover other important clinical issues
in extracranial cerebrovascular disease management.113
Strengths and limitations. The strength of this systematic review and meta-analyses includes following
rigorous procedures, such as selecting and appraising
studies by pairs of independent reviewers, the comprehensive search that included several databases, and
collaboration with content experts from the SVS. Clear
limitations of the evidence base are however present.
Comparative studies about the timing of carotid intervention after acute stroke and the optimal sequence of
intervention in patients with combined carotid and coronary disease are needed. The estimates in these comparisons were highly imprecise. Considering that
blinding of patients and surgeons is not feasible in
studies of carotid disease, we encourage the blinding of
outcome assessors and data analysts, which is possible
and highly desirable to decrease the risk of bias. Studies
that compare the outcomes and cost effectiveness of
carotid screening are also needed.

CONCLUSIONS
This systematic review supports the SVS clinical practice guidelines for commonly raised clinical scenarios in
the management of extracranial carotid disease. CEA
was superior to medical therapy in the long-term prevention of stroke/death over medical therapy. CEA was also
superior to transfemoral CAS in minimizing long-term
stroke/death for symptomatic low risk surgical patients.
CEA should optimally be performed between 2 and
14 days from the onset of acute stroke. This systematic review demonstrates that the presence of multiple risk factors increases the value of carotid screening.
Future clariﬁcation of some of these issues, particularly
with advances in medical therapy (including the use of
statins), might further impact the beneﬁt of medical
therapy. Additionally, analysis of current medical therapy
will be better understood vs carotid intervention once
several currently ongoing randomized trials (eg, CREST2,
SPACE2) are completed. Similarly, with the introduction
of transcarotid artery revascularization,114 the role of
CAS in treating both symptomatic/asymptomatic patients would need to be clariﬁed over the long-term.
Other larger studies regarding the timing of carotid intervention after acute stroke will be very beneﬁcial.

neurologic symptoms
including TIAs, strokes,
amaurosis fugax, retinal
stroke, dizziness, vertigo,
syncope, tinnitus, blurred
vision, mental status
changes, eye pain, or even

excluded. Scans that were
performed for any signs of
carotid artery disease
including a decreased
carotid pulse, cervical
bruit, pulsatile neck mass,
or Hollenhorst’s plaque
were also eliminated.
Scans that were
