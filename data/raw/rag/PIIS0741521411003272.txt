The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the American Venous Forum (AVF) have developed clinical practice
guidelines for the care of patients with varicose veins of the lower limbs and pelvis. The document also includes
recommendations on the management of superficial and perforating vein incompetence in patients with associated, more
advanced chronic venous diseases (CVDs), including edema, skin changes, or venous ulcers. Recommendations of the
Venous Guideline Committee are based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation
(GRADE) system as strong (GRADE 1) if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, burden, and costs. The suggestions are
weak (GRADE 2) if the benefits are closely balanced with risks and burden. The level of available evidence to support the
evaluation or treatment can be of high (A), medium (B), or low or very low (C) quality. The key recommendations of
these guidelines are: We recommend that in patients with varicose veins or more severe CVD, a complete history and
detailed physical examination are complemented by duplex ultrasound scanning of the deep and superficial veins
(GRADE 1A). We recommend that the CEAP classification is used for patients with CVD (GRADE 1A) and that the
revised Venous Clinical Severity Score is used to assess treatment outcome (GRADE 1B). We suggest compression
therapy for patients with symptomatic varicose veins (GRADE 2C) but recommend against compression therapy as the
primary treatment if the patient is a candidate for saphenous vein ablation (GRADE 1B). We recommend compression
therapy as the primary treatment to aid healing of venous ulceration (GRADE 1B). To decrease the recurrence of venous
ulcers, we recommend ablation of the incompetent superficial veins in addition to compression therapy (GRADE 1A). For
treatment of the incompetent great saphenous vein (GSV), we recommend endovenous thermal ablation (radiofrequency
or laser) rather than high ligation and inversion stripping of the saphenous vein to the level of the knee (GRADE 1B). We
recommend phlebectomy or sclerotherapy to treat varicose tributaries (GRADE 1B) and suggest foam sclerotherapy as an
option for the treatment of the incompetent saphenous vein (GRADE 2C). We recommend against selective treatment of
perforating vein incompetence in patients with simple varicose veins (CEAP class C2; GRADE 1B), but we suggest
treatment of pathologic perforating veins (outward flow duration >500 ms, vein diameter >3.5 mm) located underneath
healed or active ulcers (CEAP class C5-C6; GRADE 2B). We suggest treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome and pelvic
varices with coil embolization, plugs, or transcatheter sclerotherapy, used alone or together (GRADE 2B). ( J Vasc Surg

1. Clinical examination
For clinical examination of the lower limbs for chronic venous
disease, we recommend inspection (telangiectasia, varicosity,
edema, skin discoloration, corona phlebectatica,
lipodermatosclerosis, ulcer), palpation (cord, varicosity, tenderness,
induration, reflux, pulses, thrill, groin or abdominal masses),
auscultation (bruit), and examination of ankle mobility. Patients
should be asked for symptoms of chronic venous disease, which
may include tingling, aching, burning, pain, muscle cramps,
swelling, sensations of throbbing or heaviness, itching skin, restless
legs, leg tiredness, and fatigue.
2. Duplex scanning
We recommend that in patients with chronic venous disease, a
complete history and detailed physical examination are
complemented by duplex scanning of the deep and superficial
veins. The test is safe, noninvasive, cost-effective, and reliable.
We recommend that the four components of a complete duplex
scanning examination for chronic venous disease should be
visualization, compressibility, venous flow, including measurement
of duration of reflux, and augmentation.
We recommend that reflux to confirm valvular incompetence in the
upright position of the patients be elicited in one of two ways:
either with increased intra-abdominal pressure using a Valsalva
maneuver to assess the common femoral vein and the
saphenofemoral junction, or for the more distal veins, use of
manual or cuff compression and release of the limb distal to the
point of examination.
We recommend a cutoff value of 1 second for abnormally reversed
flow (reflux) in the femoral and popliteal veins and of 500 ms for
the great saphenous vein, the small saphenous vein, the tibial, deep
femoral, and the perforating veins.
We recommend that in patients with chronic venous insufficiency,
duplex scanning of the perforating veins is performed selectively.
We recommend that the definition of “pathologic” perforating
veins includes those with an outward flow of duration of ⱖ500 ms,
with a diameter of ⱖ3.5 mm and a location beneath healed or
open venous ulcers (CEAP class C5-C6).
3. Plethysmography
We suggest that venous plethysmography be used selectively for the
noninvasive evaluation of the venous system in patients with simple
varicose veins (CEAP class C2).
We recommend that venous plethysmography be used for the
noninvasive evaluation of the venous system in patients with
advanced chronic venous disease if duplex scanning does not
provide definitive information on pathophysiology (CEAP class
C3-C6).

Guideline title
We recommend that in patients with varicose veins and more
advanced chronic venous disease, computed tomography
venography, magnetic resonance venography, ascending and
descending contrast venography, and intravascular ultrasonography
are used selectively, including but not limited to post-thrombotic
syndrome, thrombotic or nonthrombotic iliac vein obstruction
(May-Thurner syndrome), pelvic congestion syndrome, nutcracker
syndrome, vascular malformations, venous trauma, tumors, and
planned open or endovascular venous interventions.
5. Laboratory evaluation
We recommend that in patients with varicose veins, evaluation for
thrombophilia is needed selectively for those with recurrent deep
venous thrombosis, thrombosis at a young age, or thrombosis in
an unusual site. Laboratory examinations are needed in patients
with long-standing venous stasis ulcers and in selected patients
who undergo general anesthesia for the treatment of chronic
venous disease.
6. Classification
We recommend that the CEAP classification be used for patients with
chronic venous disease. The basic CEAP classification is used for
clinical practice, and the full CEAP classification system is used for
clinical research.
We recommend that primary venous disorders, including simple
varicose veins, be differentiated from secondary venous
insufficiency and from congenital venous disorders because the
three conditions differ in pathophysiology and management.
7. Outcome assessment
We recommend that the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score is
used for assessment of clinical outcome after therapy for varicose
veins and more advanced chronic venous disease.
We recommend that a quality-of-life assessment is performed with a
disease-specific instrument to evaluate patient-reported outcome
and the severity of chronic venous disease.
We recommend duplex scanning for follow-up of patients after
venous procedures who have symptoms or recurrence of varicose
veins.
We recommend reporting procedure-related minor and major
complications after therapy.
8. Medical therapy
We suggest venoactive drugs (diosmin, hesperidin, rutosides,
sulodexide, micronized purified flavonoid fraction, or horse
chestnut seed extract [aescin]) in addition to compression for
patients with pain and swelling due to chronic venous disease, in
countries where these drugs are available.
We suggest using pentoxifylline or micronized purified flavonoid
fraction, if available, in combination with compression, to
accelerate healing of venous ulcers.
9. Compression therapy
We suggest compression therapy using moderate pressure (20 to 30
mm Hg) for patients with symptomatic varicose veins.
We recommend against compression therapy as the primary
treatment of symptomatic varicose veins in patients who are
candidates for saphenous vein ablation.
We recommend compression as the primary therapeutic modality for
healing venous ulcers.
We recommend compression as an adjuvant treatment to superficial
vein ablation for the prevention of ulcer recurrence.
10. Open venous surgery
For treatment of the incompetent great saphenous vein, we suggest
high ligation and inversion stripping of the saphenous vein to the
level of the knee.
To reduce hematoma formation, pain, and swelling, we recommend
postoperative compression. The recommended period of
compression in C2 patients is 1 week.

Guideline title
For treatment of small saphenous vein incompetence, we recommend
high ligation of the vein at the knee crease, about 3 to 5 cm distal
to the saphenopopliteal junction, with selective invagination
stripping of the incompetent portion of the vein.
To decrease recurrence of venous ulcers, we recommend ablation of
the incompetent superficial veins in addition to compression
therapy.
We suggest preservation of the saphenous vein using the ambulatory
conservative hemodynamic treatment of varicose veins (CHIVA)
technique only selectively in patients with varicose veins, when
performed by trained venous interventionists.
We suggest preservation of the saphenous vein using the ambulatory
selective varicose vein ablation under local anesthesia (ASVAL)
procedure only selectively in patients with varicose veins.
We recommend ambulatory phlebectomy for treatment of varicose
veins, performed with saphenous vein ablation, either during the
same procedure or at a later stage. If general anesthesia is required
for phlebectomy, we suggest concomitant saphenous ablation.
We suggest transilluminated powered phlebectomy using lower
oscillation speeds and extended tumescence as an alternative to
traditional phlebectomy for extensive varicose veins.
For treatment of recurrent varicose veins, we suggest ligation of the
saphenous stump, ambulatory phlebectomy, sclerotherapy, or
endovenous thermal ablation, depending on the etiology, source,
location, and extent of varicosity.
11. Endovenous thermal ablation
Endovenous thermal ablations (laser and radiofrequency ablations)
are safe and effective, and we recommend them for treatment of
saphenous incompetence.
Because of reduced convalescence and less pain and morbidity, we
recommend endovenous thermal ablation of the incompetent
saphenous vein over open surgery.
12. Sclerotherapy of varicose veins
We recommend liquid or foam sclerotherapy for telangiectasia,
reticular veins, and varicose veins.
For treatment of the incompetent saphenous vein, we recommend
endovenous thermal ablation over chemical ablation with foam.
13. Treatment of perforating veins
We recommend against selective treatment of incompetent
perforating veins in patients with simple varicose veins (CEAP class
C2).
We suggest treatment of “pathologic” perforating veins that includes
those with an outward flow duration of ⱖ500 ms, with a diameter
of ⱖ3.5 mm, located beneath a healed or open venous ulcer
(CEAP class C5-C6).
For treatment of “pathologic” perforating veins, we suggest
subfascial endoscopic perforating vein surgery, ultrasonographically
guided sclerotherapy, or thermal ablations.
14. Treatment of pelvic varicose veins
We recommend noninvasive imaging with transabdominal and/or
transvaginal ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic
resonance venography in selected patients with symptoms of pelvic
congestion syndrome or symptomatic varices in the distribution of
the pubis, labia, perineum, or buttocks.
We recommend retrograde ovarian and internal iliac venography in
patients with pelvic venous disease, confirmed or suspected by
noninvasive imaging studies, in whom an intervention is planned.
We suggest treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome and pelvic
varices with coil embolization, plugs, or transcatheter
sclerotherapy, used alone or together.
If less invasive treatment is not available or has failed, we suggest
surgical ligation and excision of ovarian veins to treat reflux.

INTRODUCTION
In the United States, an estimated 23% of adults have
varicose veins, and 6% have more advanced chronic venous
disease (CVD), including skin changes and healed or active
venous ulcers.1 Varicose veins have long been considered a
cosmetic problem that only affected emotional well-being
but were not the source of disability. Varicosities, however,
are frequently the cause of discomfort, pain, loss of working
days, disability, and deterioration of health-related quality
of life (QOL).1-3 Severe CVD may also lead to loss of limb
or loss of life.4
Evaluation of varicose veins has greatly progressed in
the past 2 decades with the widespread availability of duplex
ultrasonography.5 The treatment of varicose veins has also
undergone dramatic changes with the introduction of percutaneous endovenous ablation techniques, including endovenous laser therapy (EVLA),6,7 radiofrequency ablation
(RFA),8 and liquid or foam sclerotherapy.9,10 Open surgical treatment with stripping of the varicose veins performed
under general anesthesia, with the associated pain, potential for wound complications, and loss of working days, has
been largely replaced by percutaneous office-based procedures that can be performed under local or tumescent
anesthesia with similar early and midterm results but with
less discomfort to the patient, improved early QOL, and
earlier return to work.11-13
The purpose of this document is to report recently
formulated current recommendations for the evaluation
and treatment of patients with varicose veins of the lower
limbs and pelvis. These Guidelines also include recommendations for management of superficial and perforating vein
incompetence in patients with associated, more advanced
CVDs, such as venous edema, skin changes, or ulcerations.
To accomplish this task, a joint Venous Guideline Committee of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the
American Venous Forum (AVF) was established.
Under no circumstance should these Guidelines be
construed in practice or legal terms as defining the “standard of care,” which is solely determined by the condition
of the individual patient, treatment setting, and other factors. Individual factors in a given patient, such as symptom
variance or combinations, comorbidities, work, and socioeconomic factors may dictate a different approach than that
described in the Guidelines. Because technology and disease knowledge is rapidly expanding, new approaches may
supersede these recommendations. As important new information on management of varicose veins and related
CVD becomes available, these recommendations will be
revised without delay.
METHODOLOGY OF GUIDELINES
Evidence-based medicine is the conscientious, explicit,
and judicious use of the current best evidence in making
decisions about the care of individual patients.14 Guidelines
for the care of patients with varicose veins, as recommended
in this report, are based on scientific evidence. The need for
adopting evidence-based guidelines and reporting stan-

dards for venous diseases has long been recognized by
international experts15 and by leaders of the SVS16 and
AVF.17-20 To define current guidelines, members of the
Venous Guideline Committee reviewed the relevant literature, including previously published consensus documents
and guidelines,21-31 meta-analyses,6-12,32-42 the AVF reports on the Venous Summit at the 2006 and 2009 Pacific
Vascular Symposiums13,43-46 and considered the recommendations published in the third edition of the Handbook
of Venous Disorders, Guidelines of the American Venous
Forum.47
The guidelines in this publication are based on the
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development,
and Evaluation (GRADE) system, as it was described by
Guyatt et al (Table I).48 For each guideline, the letter A, B,
or C marks the level of current evidence. The grade of
recommendation of a guideline can be strong (1) or weak
(2), depending on the risk and burden of a particular
diagnostic test or a therapeutic procedure to the patient vs
the expected benefit. The words “we recommend” are used
for GRADE 1—strong recommendations—if the benefits
clearly outweigh risks and burdens, or vice versa; the words
“we suggest” are used for GRADE 2—weak recommendations—when the benefits are closely balanced with risks and
burdens.
DEFINITIONS
In this document, the updated terminology for superficial, perforating, and deep veins of the leg and pelvis are
used.49,50 Definitions of varicose and spider veins as well
as other manifestations of CVD follow recommendations
of the CEAP classification and the recent update on
venous terminology of the International Committee of
the AVF.51,52
Varicose veins of the lower limbs are dilated subcutaneous veins that are ⱖ3 mm in diameter measured in the
upright position.53 Synonyms include varix, varices, and
varicosities. Varicosity can involve the main axial superficial
veins—the great saphenous vein (GSV) or the small saphenous vein (SSV)— or any other superficial vein tributaries of
the lower limbs.
Most varicose veins are due to primary venous disease.
The most frequent cause is likely an intrinsic morphologic
or biochemical abnormality in the vein wall, although the
etiology can also be multifactorial. Labropoulos et al54
proposed that the origin of venous reflux in patients with
primary varicose veins can be local or multifocal structural
weakness of the vein wall and that this can occur together or
independently of proximal saphenous vein valvular incompetence. Varicosities can also develop as a result of secondary causes, such as previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT),
deep venous obstruction, superficial thrombophlebitis, or
arteriovenous fistula. Varicose veins may also be congenital
and present as a venous malformation.
Varicosities are manifestations of CVD.51,52 CVD includes various medical conditions of long duration, all
involving morphologic and functional abnormalities of the
venous system manifested by symptoms or signs (or both),

indicating the need for investigation and care. The term
chronic venous disorder is reserved for the full spectrum of
venous abnormalities and includes dilated intradermal veins
and venules between 1 and 3 mm in diameter (spider veins,
reticular veins, telangiectasia; CEAP class C1).
Varicose veins can progress to a more advanced form of
chronic venous dysfunction such as chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).55,56 In CVI, increased ambulatory venous
hypertension initiates a series of changes in the subcutaneous tissue and the skin: activation of the endothelial
cells, extravasation of macromolecules and red blood
cells, diapedesis of leukocytes, tissue edema, and chronic
inflammatory changes most frequently noted at and
above the ankles.41,53 Limb swelling, pigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis, eczema, or venous ulcerations can
develop in these patients.
THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM
In the adult Western population, the prevalence of
varicose veins is ⬎20% (range, 21.8%-29.4%), and about 5%
(range, 3.6%-8.6%) have venous edema, skin changes or
venous ulcerations. Active venous ulcers are present in up
to 0.5%, and between 0.6% and 1.4% have healed ulcers.57
On the basis of estimates of the San Diego epidemiologic
study, more than 11 million men and 22 million women
between the ages of 40 and 80 years in the United States
have varicose veins, and ⬎2 million adults have advanced

CVD, with skin changes or ulcers.1 The incidence of postthrombotic venous ulcers has not changed in the past 2
decades for women, and it recently increased in men.58 In
the United States each year, at least 20,556 patients receive
a new diagnosis of venous ulcers.3
The Bonn Vein Study,59 which enrolled 3072 randomly selected participants (1722 women and 1350 men),
aged from 18 to 79 years, found symptoms of CVD in
49.1% of men and in 62.1% of women. Also reported were
varicose veins without edema or skin changes in 14.3%
(12.4% men, 15.8% women), edema in 13.4% (11.6% men,
14.9% women), skin changes in 2.9% (3.1% men, 2.7%
women), and healed or active ulceration in 0.6% or 0.1%,
respectively. A French cross-sectional survey found varicose
veins in 23.7% of men and 46.3% of women.60
The National Venous Screening Program, under the
auspices of the AVF, screened 2234 Americans for venous
disease.61 The participants’ mean age was 60 years, 77%
were women, and 80% were white. The CEAP clinical
classification of C0 to C6 was 29%, 29%, 23%, 10%, 9%,
1.5%, and 0.5%, respectively. Reflux or obstruction was
noted in 37% and 5% of participants, respectively.
Progression of primary varicosity to severe CVI and
venous ulcer is not rare: in the North American subfascial
endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS) registry, more patients with advanced CVI had primary venous disease than
post-thrombotic syndrome (70% vs 30%).62 Bauer63 had

8S Gloviczki et al

already observed in 1948 that 58% of his patients with
advanced CVD, studied with phlebography, never had a
previous DVT.
Varicose veins and venous ulcers can be a great
financial burden to patients and to society. Varicose veins
and associated complications may lead to chronic pain,
disability, decreased quality of life (QOL), loss of working days, and early retirement. In the United States, the
direct medical cost of CVD has been estimated to be
between $150 million and $1 billion annually.3,4 In the
United Kingdom, 2% of the national health care budget
per year (US $1 billion) is spent on the management of
leg ulcers.1
Venous ulcer is an under-recognized and undertreated
disease. A recently published supplement of the Journal of
Vascular Surgery details the noble goal of the Pacific Vascular Symposium 6 (PVS6) to lead a call to action to
formulate a doable and achievable plan to reduce the incidence of venous ulcers in the United States by 50% in 10
years.64
ANATOMY
During the past decade, new venous terminology has
been developed and adopted by vascular societies around
the world.47,49,61 The success of assigning uniform names
to common veins was accompanied by new information on
anatomy obtained with duplex ultrasonography, threedimensional computed tomography (CT), and magnetic
resonance (MR) imaging; all these resulted in better understanding of the anatomy of veins and the pathology of
CVD.33,62
Superficial veins
Superficial veins of the lower limbs are those located
between the deep fascia, covering the muscles of the
limb, and the skin. The main superficial veins are the
GSV and the SSV. All previous names used to describe
these vessels (greater, long, lesser) should be abandoned.
The GSV originates from the medial superficial veins of
the dorsum of the foot and ascends in front of the medial
malleolus along the medial border of the tibia, next to
the saphenous nerve (Fig 1). There are posterior and
anterior accessory saphenous veins in the calf and the
thigh. The saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) is the confluence of superficial inguinal veins, comprising the GSV
and the superficial circumflex iliac, superficial epigastric,
and external pudendal veins. The GSV in the thigh lies in
the saphenous subcompartment of the superficial compartment, between the saphenous fascia and the deep
fascia.
The SSV is the most important posterior superficial vein
of the leg (Fig 2). It originates from the lateral side of the
foot and drains blood into the popliteal vein, joining it
usually just proximal to the knee crease. The intersaphenous vein (vein of Giacomini), which runs in the posterior

Deep veins
Deep veins accompany the main arteries of the limb and
pelvis. The deep veins of the calf (anterior, posterior tibial,
and peroneal veins) are paired structures, and the popliteal
and femoral veins may also be paired. The gastrocnemius
and soleal veins are important deep tributaries. The old
term superficial femoral vein has been replaced by the new
term femoral vein.52 The femoral vein connects the popliteal to the common femoral vein.
The pelvic veins include the external, internal, and
common iliac veins, which drain into the inferior vena cava
(IVC). Large gonadal veins drain into the IVC on the right
and the left renal vein on the left.
Perforating veins
Perforating veins connect the superficial to the deep
venous system (Fig 1). They pass through the deep fascia
that separates the superficial compartment from the deep.
Communicating veins connect veins within the same system. The most important leg perforating veins are the
medial calf perforators.66 The posterior tibial perforating
veins (Cockett perforators in the old nomenclature) con-

nect the posterior accessory GSV of the calf (the posterior
arch vein in the old nomenclature) with the posterior tibial
veins and form the lower, middle, and upper groups. They
are located just behind the medial malleolus (lower), at 7 to
9 cm (middle) and at 10 to 12 cm (upper) from the lower
edge of the malleolus. The distance between these perforators and the medial edge of the tibia is 2 to 4 cm.66 (Fig 1).
Paratibial perforators connect the main GSV trunk with
the posterior tibial veins. In the distal thigh, perforators
of the femoral canal usually connect directly the GSV to
the femoral vein.
Venous valves
Bicuspid venous valves are important structures assisting unidirectional flow in the normal venous system. The
GSV usually has at least 6 valves (range, 4-25), with a
constant valve present within 2 to 3 cm of the SFJ in 85% of
cases,67 and the SSV has a median of 7 to 10 valves (range,
4-13).68 There are valves in the deep veins of the lower
limb, but the common femoral or external iliac vein has
only one valve in about 63% of cases.68 In 37%, there is no
valve in the common femoral or external iliac veins. The
internal iliac vein has a valve in 10%; its tributaries have
valves in 9%.69

Patients with varicose veins may present with no symptoms at all; the varices are then of cosmetic concern only,
with an underlying psychologic impact. Psychologic concerns related to the cosmetic appearance of varicose veins
will, however, reduce a patient’s QOL in many cases.
Symptoms related to varicose veins or more advanced
CVD include tingling, aching, burning, pain, muscle
cramps, swelling, sensations of throbbing or heaviness,
itching skin, restless legs, leg tiredness, and fatigue.70 Although not pathognomonic, these symptoms suggest
CVD, particularly if they are exacerbated by heat or dependency noted during the course of the day and relieved by
resting or elevating the legs or by wearing elastic stockings
or bandages.51 Pain during and after exercise that is relieved
with rest and leg elevation (venous claudication) can also be
caused by venous outflow obstruction caused by previous
DVT or by narrowing or obstruction of the common iliac
veins (May-Thurner syndrome).69-71 Diffuse pain is more
frequently associated with axial venous reflux, whereas poor
venous circulation in bulging varicose veins usually causes
local pain.
History. A thorough medical history is essential in the
patient’s evaluation and may establish the diagnosis of
primary, secondary, or congenital varicosities. Questions
to patients who present with varicose veins should address
previous DVT or thrombophlebitis, established thrombophilia, medication history (particularly birth control pills),
smoking, pregnancies, and a family history of varicosity or
thrombotic disorders. Premenopausal women with varicose
veins should also be questioned for symptoms of pelvic
congestion syndrome (pelvic pain, aching, or heaviness;
dyspareunia). Advanced age is the most important risk
factor for varicose veins and for CVI. A positive family
history, female sex, and multiparity are also risk factors for
varicose veins, and a positive family history and obesity are
risk factors for CVI.57
Physical examination. Clinical evaluation should focus on signs of venous disease, and examination in the
standing patient in a warm room, with good light, should
establish the size, location, and distribution of varicose
veins. Inspection and palpation are essential parts of the
examination, and auscultation (bruit) is particularly helpful
in those with vascular malformation and arteriovenous
fistula.71 Varicose dilations or venous aneurysms, palpable
cord in the vein, tenderness, a thrill, bruit, or pulsatility
should be recorded. In addition, the presence of spider
veins or telangiectasia, limb swelling that is usually partially
pitting or nonpitting, induration, pigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis, atrophie blanche, eczema, dermatitis, skin
discoloration, increased skin temperature, and healed or
active ulcers should be documented.
Ankle mobility should also be examined, because patients with advanced venous disease frequently have decreased mobility in the ankle joints. Sensory and motor
functions of the limb and foot are assessed to help differen-

tiate from diabetic neuropathy or any underlying neurologic problem. An abdominal mass or lymphadenopathy
may be a clue to venous compression and outflow
obstruction.
Corona phlebectatica (ankle flare or malleolar flare)
is a fan-shaped pattern of small intradermal veins located
around the ankle or the dorsum of the foot. This is
considered an early sign of advanced venous disease. The
pattern of the varicose veins should be established, because perineal, vulvar, or groin varicosity can be a sign of
iliac vein obstruction or internal iliac vein or gonadal
vein incompetence causing pelvic congestion syndrome.
Scrotal varicosity may be a sign of gonadal vein incompetence, left renal vein compression between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta (nutcracker syndrome), or occasionally, even IVC lesions or renal
carcinoma. Varicose veins of the upper thigh can be
caused by inferior gluteal vein reflux.72,73
Classic tourniquet tests for saphenous or perforator
incompetence or deep venous occlusion (Trendelenburg
test, Ochsner-Mahorner test, Perthes test)71 are rarely used
today; they are mostly of historic interest and should be
used in rare instances, when duplex scanning or Doppler
studies are not available. Distal palpation and proximal
percussion of the saphenous vein, however, are useful tests
to suggest valvular incompetence.
Skin lesions, such as capillary malformations, tumors,
onychomycosis, or excoriations, should be noted and a
complete pulse examination performed to exclude underlying peripheral arterial disease. An aneurysmal saphenous vein can be misdiagnosed as a femoral hernia or
vice versa. The presence of a longer limb, lateral varicosity noted soon after birth, and associated capillary malformations are tip-offs for congenital venous malformation (Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome),74,75 whereas edema
of the dorsum of the foot, squaring of the toes, thick
skin, and nonpitting edema are signs of chronic
lymphedema. The physical examination can be complemented by a handheld Doppler examination, although
the latter does not replace evaluation of the venous
circulation with color duplex scanning.
The Guideline Committee recommends using the
basic CEAP classification76,77 (see Classification of
chronic venous disorders later in the Guidelines) to document the clinical class, etiology, anatomy, and pathophysiology (CEAP) of CVD (Tables II and III). We also
recommend use of the revised Venous Clinical Severity
Score (VCSS)78 to grade the severity of CVD (see Outcome assessment; Table IV).
The aim of the clinical evaluation is not only to determine the presenting signs and symptoms and the type of
venous disease (primary, secondary, congenital) but also to
exclude other etiologies, including peripheral arterial disease, rheumatoid disease, infection, tumor, or allergies. The
physician should also establish the degree of disability
caused by the venous disease and its impact on the patient’s
QOL.

Duplex scanning
Duplex scanning is recommended as the first diagnostic
test for all patients with suspected CVD.5,79 The test is safe,
noninvasive, cost-effective, and reliable. It has much better
diagnostic accuracy in the assessment of venous insufficiency than continuous-wave Doppler ultrasonography.80
B-mode imaging permits accurate placement of the pulsed
Doppler sample volume, and the addition of color makes it
easier to establish obstruction, turbulence, and the direction of venous and arterial flow.44 Duplex scanning is
excellent for the evaluation of infrainguinal venous obstruction and valvular incompetence.81 It also differentiates
between acute venous thrombosis and chronic venous
changes.82,83
Technique of the examination. The technique of
venous duplex scanning has been described in detail previously by several authors.80,83-88 The pulsed-wave Doppler
of 4 to 7-MHz linear array tranducers are used most
frequently for the deeper veins, with the higher-frequency
probes used more to assess the superficial veins. Evaluation
of reflux in the deep and superficial veins with duplex
scanning should be performed with the patient upright,

with the leg rotated outward, heel on the ground, and
weight taken on the opposite limb.5 The supine position
gives both false-positive and false-negative results of
reflux.84
The examination is started below the inguinal ligament, and the veins are examined in 3- to 5-cm intervals.
For a complete examination, all deep veins of the leg are
examined, including the common femoral, femoral, deep
femoral, popliteal, peroneal, soleal, gastrocnemial, anterior,
and posterior tibial veins. The superficial veins are then
evaluated, including the GSV, the SSV, the accessory saphenous veins, and the perforating veins.
The four components that should be included in a
complete duplex scanning examination for CVD are (1)
visibility, (2) compressibility, (3) venous flow, including
measurement of the duration of reflux, and (4) augmentation. Asymmetry in flow velocity, lack of respiratory variations in venous flow, and waveform patterns at rest and
during flow augmentation in the common femoral veins
indicate proximal obstruction. Reflux can be elicited in two
ways: increased intra-abdominal pressure using a Valsalva
maneuver for the common femoral vein or the SFJ, or by
manual compression and release of the limb distal to the
point of examination. The first is more appropriate for
evaluation of reflux in the common femoral vein and at the
SFJ, whereas compression and release is the preferred technique more distally on the limb.84 The advantage of a distal
cuff deflation was emphasized by van Bemmelen et al.85
The cutoff value for abnormally reversed venous flow
(reflux) in the saphenous, tibial, and deep femoral veins has
been 500 ms.81 International consensus documents previously recommended 0.5 seconds as a cutoff value for all
veins to use for lower limb venous incompetence.5,22,86
This value is, however, longer, 1 second, for the femoral
and popliteal veins.81 For the perforating veins, cutoff

Gloviczki et al 11S

values of both 350 ms and 500 ms have been suggested.5,81
The Committee recommends 500 ms as the cutoff value for
saphenous, tibial, deep femoral, and perforating vein incompetence, and 1 second for femoral and popliteal vein
incompetence.
Perforating veins have been evaluated in patients with
advanced disease, usually in those with healed or active
venous ulcers (CEAP class C5-C6) or in those with recurrent varicose veins after previous interventions. The diameter of clinically relevant “pathologic” perforators (eg, beneath healed or open venous ulcer) may predict valve
incompetence. In a study by Labrapoulos et al,87 a perforator vein diameter ⬎3.9 mm had a high specificity (96%)
but a low sensitivity (73%) to predict incompetence, given
that almost one-third of the incompetent perforators had a
diameter of ⬍3.9 mm.87,88 Sandri et al,89 however, found
that a perforator diameter of ⱖ3.5 mm was associated with
reflux in ⬎90% of cases. The SVS/AVF Guideline Committee definition of “pathologic” perforating veins includes
those with outward flow of ⱖ500 ms, with a diameter of
ⱖ3.5 mm, located beneath a healed or open venous ulcer
(CEAP class C5-C6).5,81,88,89
Duplex findings in CVD. A duplex evaluation of
patients with CVD demonstrated that superficial vein reflux
was present in 90% and that 70% to 80% have reflux in the
GSV.90 Patients with venous ulcers usually have multilevel
disease affecting the superficial, deep, and perforating veins.
Duplex evaluations have also revealed that 74% to 93% of all
patients with venous ulcers have superficial vein incompetence, with superficial venous reflux being the only abnormality in 17% to 54% of the limbs. Of 239 patients with
venous ulcers evaluated with duplex scanning in three
different studies, 144 (60.3%) had incompetent perforating
veins, and 141 (59%) had deep vein incompetence or
obstruction.91-93
Plethysmography
Plethysmography (air or strain-gauge) is used for the
noninvasive evaluation of calf muscle pump function, global
venous reflux, and venous outflow obstruction.86,94-96 Straingauge plethysmography is usually performed with a modified
protocol of Struckmann, validated previously by comparison
with simultaneously recorded ambulatory venous pressure
measurements.97-100 Strain-gauge or air plethysmography
consists of exercise venous plethysmography, measurement of
passive refill and drainage, and outflow plethysmography.
Plethysmography quantifies venous reflux and obstruction
and has been used to monitor venous functional changes and
assess physiologic outcome of surgical treatments.95 For more
details of these examinations, the reader is referred to original
articles94,96,97 and a recent relevant book chapter.100
The use of plethysmography is less frequently indicated
in patients with CEAP C2 disease (simple varicose veins),
but these studies provide information on venous function
in patients with CVI, and they are complementary examination to duplex scanning. Examples for use in patients may
include those with suspected outflow obstruction but normal duplex findings or those suspected of having venous

disease due to calf muscle pump dysfunction, but no reflux
or obstruction was noted on duplex scanning. Air plethysmography remains one of the few noninvasive techniques
that can quantify reflux reliably98,99 although other parameters have been reported to be variably useful. The Guideline Committee encourages using air plethysmography as
“best practice” in the evaluation of patients with advance
CVD if duplex scanning does not provide definitive diagnosis on pathophysiology (CEAP C3-C6).
Imaging studies
Contrast venography. Ascending or descending contrast venography for varicosities or other forms of CVD is
performed selectively in patients with deep venous obstruc-

tion, in patients with post-thrombotic syndrome, and if
endovenous or open surgical treatment is planned. It can be
used with direct venous pressure measurements to evaluate
patients with varicose veins and associated iliac vein obstruction (May-Thurner syndrome). Contrast venography
is routinely used in CVD to perform endovenous procedures, such as angioplasty or venous stenting or open
venous reconstructions.
CT and MR venography. Patients with simple varicose veins rarely require imaging studies more sophisticated
than duplex ultrasonography. The techniques of CT and
MR imaging have progressed tremendously in the past
decade, and they provide excellent three-dimensional imaging of the venous system. MR and CT are both suitable

For clinical examination of the lower limbs for chronic venous disease, we recommend

induration, reflux, pulses, thrill, groin or abdominal masses) auscultation (bruit),
and examination of ankle mobility. Patients should be asked for symptoms of
chronic venous disease, which may include tingling, aching, burning, pain, muscle

We recommend that in patients with chronic venous disease, a complete history and

and superficial veins. The test is safe, noninvasive, cost-effective, and reliable.
We recommend that the four components of a complete duplex scanning
examination for chronic venous disease should be visualization, compressibility,
venous flow, including measurement of duration of reflux, and augmentation.
We recommend that reflux to confirm valvular incompetence in the upright
position of the patients be elicited in one of two ways: either with increased intraabdominal pressure using a Valsalva maneuver to assess the common femoral vein
and the saphenofemoral junction, or for the more distal veins, use of manual or
cuff compression and release of the limb distal to the point of examination.
We recommend a cutoff value of 1 second for abnormally reversed flow (reflux) in
the femoral and popliteal veins and of 500 ms for the great saphenous vein, the
small saphenous vein, the tibial, deep femoral, and the perforating veins.
We recommend that in patients with chronic venous insufficiency, duplex scanning
of the perforating veins is performed selectively. We recommend that the
definition of “pathologic” perforating veins includes those with an outward flow
of duration of ⱖ500 ms, with a diameter of ⱖ3.5 mm and a location beneath
healed or open venous ulcers (CEAP class C5-C6).

to identify pelvic venous obstruction or iliac vein stenosis in
patients with lower limb varicosity when a proximal obstruction or iliac vein compression (May-Thurner syndrome) is suspected.101 They are suitable to establish left
renal vein compression (nutcracker syndrome),102 gonadal
vein incompetence, and pelvic venous congestion syndrome. MR imaging with gadolinium is especially useful in
evaluating patients with vascular malformations, including
those with congenital varicose veins.
Intravascular ultrasonography. Intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) has been used successfully to evaluate
iliac vein compression or obstruction and to monitor patients after venous stenting.101 For patients with varicose

veins, IVUS should be used selectively in those with suspected or confirmed iliac vein obstruction. IVUS is important in assessing the morphology of the vessel wall, identifying lesions such as trabeculations, frozen valves, mural
thickness, and external compression that are not seen with
conventional contrast venography, and it provides measurements in assessing the degree of stenosis. In addition,
IVUS confirms the position of the stent in the venous
segment and the resolution of the stenosis.101

interventions.

tests are not routinely performed. In those with recurrent
DVT, thrombosis at a young age, or thrombosis in an
unusual site, we recommend screening for thrombophilia.
Laboratory examination is also needed in patients with
long-standing recalcitrant venous ulcers. One study found
2.1% of venous and arterial ulcers had a secondary etiology,
including neoplasia, chronic inflammation, sickle cell disease, vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and hydroxyurea.103 Patients who undergo general
anesthesia for treatment of CVD may need a blood cell
count or an electrolyte panel.
CLASSIFICATION OF CVD
The cornerstone for management of CVD is the proper
diagnosis and accurate classification of the underlying venous problem, which create the base for correctly directed
treatment. The clinical and laboratory evaluation of the
patient with varicose veins or more advanced CVD should
be completed by establishing the clinical class of the disease.
The CEAP classification was developed by the AVF in 1994
and later revised in 2004.76,77 The classification is based on

1

clinical signs of venous disease (C), etiology (E), anatomy
(A), and the underlying pathophysiology (P).
Clinical class includes the full spectrum of venous disorders, from no signs of visible venous disease (C0) to
telangiectasia or reticular veins (C1), varicose veins (C2),
edema (C3), skin changes, such as pigmentation or eczema
(C4a) or lipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche (C4b),
and healed (C5) or active (C6) ulcer. The presence or
absence of symptoms is also recorded as S (symptomatic) or
A (asymptomatic).
Etiology can be congenital (Ec), primary (Ep), or secondary (Es).
The anatomic classification separates superficial venous
disease (As) from involvement of the perforators (Ap) or
deep veins (Ad). Failure to identify an anatomic location is
also coded (An).
Pathophysiology of the disease can be reflux (Pr), obstruction (Po), or both. Failure to identify venous pathophysiology is also noted (Pn). Table II includes the full
CEAP classification, and Table III lists the venous segments that can be involved in the disease.

We recommend that the CEAP classification be used for patients with varicose
veins. The basic CEAP classification is used for clinical practice, and the full
CEAP classification system is used for clinical research.
We recommend that primary venous disorders, including simple varicose
veins, be differentiated from secondary venous insufficiency and from
congenital venous disorders because the three conditions differ in
pathophysiology and management.

The basic CEAP classification is a simplified version,
suitable and easy for office use, and does not have the
details of the comprehensive CEAP classification, which
functions more as a research tool. As discussed in more
detail by Meissner et al,13 for a patient with primary,
symptomatic varicose veins and full saphenous and perforator incompetence (anatomic segments 2, 3, and 18
in Table III) with a small healed venous ulcer and skin
pigmentation, the comprehensive CEAP classification
would be C2,4a,5,SEpAs,p,Pr2,3,18.
Using the basic CEAP, the same patient would be
classified as C5,SEpAs,pPr. In the basic CEAP classification, only the highest score is used to denote the clinical
class and only the main anatomic groups (s, p, and d) are
noted.
The revised format of the classification77 includes two
elements in addition to the C-E-A-P findings: the date of
the examination and the level of the diagnostic evaluation:
Level 1: History, physical examination, Doppler examination (handheld)
Level 2: Noninvasive— duplex scan, plethysmography
Level 3: Invasive or complex evaluation— contrast venography, venous pressure measurements, IVUS, CT
venography, MR venography

The accuracy of the diagnosis increases with the addition of imaging and invasive testing. Recording the date
and method used to confirm the clinical impression can be
added in parentheses after the CEAP recording as follows:
Full form: C2,4a,5, S Ep As, p Pr2,3,18 (Level 2, Feb 8, 2010)
Basic form: C5, S EpAs pPr (Level 2; Feb 8, 2010)
The main purpose of using the CEAP classification in
patients with CVD is to distinguish primary venous disease
from congenital varicosity and, most importantly, from
secondary, post-thrombotic venous insufficiency.53 Evaluation and treatment of the three conditions are distinctly
different.
OUTCOME ASSESSMENT
Outcome assessment of therapy of varicose veins and
more advanced CVD includes standardized objective criteria that reflect patient symptoms, characteristic signs, and
objective measures of functional and disease-specific
QOL.104
Generic QOL instruments
Generic QOL measures allow comparison with population norms and other disease states and provide a measure

16S Gloviczki et al

of any ill effects of treatment. Generic and disease-specific
QOL measures are usually complementary and should be
used together. Of the generic QOL instruments the Short
Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) has been used with
success for assessment of global well-being of patients with
varicose veins.105,106
Venous disease–specific QOL instruments
Disease-specific QOL measurements are sensitive to
the beneficial effects of treatment. Different diseasespecific, patient-generated QOL tools and patient-reported
outcomes (PROs) have been popular in venous disease
reporting.107,108 The most frequently used validated venous disease–specific instruments include the Venous Insufficiency Epidemiologic and Economic Study of Qualityof-Life (VEINES-QOL/Sym) questionnaire scale, the
Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIVIQ), the
Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), and
the Charing Cross Venous Ulceration Questionnaire
(CXVUQ).2,109-113
The VEINES instrument consists of 35 items in two
categories that generate two summary scores.109 The
VEINES-QOL questionnaire comprises 25 items that
study the effect of disease on QOL, and the VEINES
symptom questionnaire (VEINES-Sym) has 10 items that
measure symptoms. The focus of VEINES is on physical
symptoms rather than psychologic and social aspects.
The CIVIQ 2 is a revision of an instrument developed
to measure physical, psychologic, social, and pain factors.113 The revised version gives equal weight to each
category, with 20 questions that provide a global score.3
CIVIQ has been used in studies3,4 and proved to be a valid
QOL measurement.
The AVVQ is a 13-question survey addressing all elements of varicose vein disease. Physical symptoms and
social issues, including pain, ankle edema, ulcers, compression therapy use, and effect on daily activities, are examined
in addition to cosmesis issues. The questionnaire is scored
from 0 (no effect from varicose veins) to 100 (severe
effect).114,115
The CXVUQ was developed to provide a QOL measure for patients with venous ulcers. It provides a consistent
measure of patient-reported QOL in venous ulcers regardless of the treatment selected. Combining it with a generic
measurement instrument may provide valuable information
on the progression of ulcers and on the available treatment
measures.3
Physician-generated measurement tools
The physician-generated measurement tools include
the CEAP classification,76,77 which, as discussed previously, is an accurate description of signs and symptoms.
However, the instrument contains too many static elements, especially in classes C4 and C5, and is not particularly suitable for an assessment of improvement after
therapy.116
The VCSS was introduced by Rutherford et al104 and
has been used successfully in several studies to evaluate

JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY
May Supplement 2011

changes in signs and symptoms over time and to quantify
outcomes.108,116-121 The VCSS is based on physician assessment of nine clinical signs or symptoms of CVD, including pain, presence of varicose veins, edema, signs of
CVI, and venous ulcers. Compliance with compression
therapy is also assessed. The VCSS correlates well with the
CEAP score and with ultrasonographic assessment of the
severity of venous valvular incompetence or obstruction.113,121-126
A revised VCSS (Table IV) has been developed recently
to clarify ambiguities, update terminology, and simplify
application of the first version.78 It now incorporates the
important language of the PRO assessment tools. The
presumption of venous origin is intended for all clinical
descriptors, and each limb is considered and scored separately. These revisions are currently being validated in a
multicenter field test.
The strength of the VCSS is in its evaluative properties
in identifying subtle intrasubject changes over time after an
intervention.122,123 An evaluation of each VCSS component allows outcome analysis on many levels, including
technical, patient-reported, and clinical outcomes. In this
sense, the revised VCSS is unique among clinical outcome
assessments and PROs. Although it is administered by a
physician, components such as pain are scored by patient
responses to subjective questions.78
To assess the benefit of a therapy, primary clinical
outcome standards are usually combined with a secondary
surrogate outcome assessment.124 Recommended reporting standards and outcome assessment for endovenous
ablation have recently been published in a joint statement
of the AVF and the Society of Interventional Radiology.124
Clinical outcomes. Clinical outcome studies evaluate
the results of procedures on patient-focused outcomes,
including symptom improvement, recurrence of varicosity,
healing or recurrence of skin ulcers, improvement in the
chronic, progressive symptoms of CVD, improved QOL,
and cosmetic improvement.124
Relief of symptoms. To report improvement in
symptoms of CVD, we recommend the use of the revised
VCSS in daily clinical practice.78 For research and publications to report outcomes, one of the validated, diseasespecific QOL instruments should be added, such as
VEINES-QOL/Sym questionnaire scale, CIVIQ-2, the
AVVQ, or the CXVUQ score in patients with advanced
venous disease.2,3,109-113 A validated Likert pain scale can
also be used, although most QOL questionnaires assess
pain and discomfort.
Disease severity. We recommend using the basic
CEAP clinical classification along with the revised VCSS in
routine clinical practice. The revised VCSS is the best
currently available instrument to quantify improvement
and assess changes in the severity of CVD during follow-up
(short-term, ⬍1 year, midterm, 1-3 years, long term, ⬎3
years; Table IV).108 For research purposes, the complete
CEAP classification should be used in addition to evaluation of QOL after treatment to help to assess the patient’s
perception of the burden of the disease. A general QOL

JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY
Volume 53, Number 16S

instrument, such as the SF-36, and one of the diseasespecific QOL instruments (eg, VEINES, CIVIQ, Aberdeen) should both be used for this purpose.
Cosmetic results. Assessment of recurrent or residual
varicose veins continues to be a challenge, and there are
significant differences between physician assessments and
patient-reported results. Patient satisfaction is directly related to the disappearance of the treated unsightly varicose
veins. Photographing the treated areas is encouraged to
assess late results on varicose vein recurrence and the status
of skin changes. The Recurrent Varicose Veins After Surgery (REVAS) classification125 is a descriptive evaluation of
recurrent and residual varicosities based on the physician’s
assessment, and we suggest its use, although further modification of the assessment is warranted.

TREATMENT
Indications

Surrogate outcomes
Surrogate outcomes assess specific technical questions
about a particular therapy. Surrogate outcomes may include patency of the ablated saphenous or perforating vein,
patency of a venous stent, or hemodynamic results after
interventions. These should be used with care when evaluating the clinical benefit of an intervention.124
Anatomic success. Patency of an ablated vein and the
length of the patent or obstructed segment of the vein, as
confirmed with duplex scanning, should be reported when
assessing anatomic success. Postprocedural duplex scanning ⱕ1 month, at 1 year, at 1 to 3 years, and ⬎3 years is
important to define periprocedural, early, midterm, and
late failures. Timing of the study is important because
saphenous patency after ablation on a periprocedural duplex image (⬍3 days) indicates technical failure, whereas
late patency after early occlusion suggests recanalization.
The type of recurrence on late duplex scanning should also
be documented, because recanalization of a previously
occluded axial vein should be distinguished from neovascularization, which implies the presence of multiple small
tortuous connections between the saphenous stump or the
femoral vein and a residual saphenous vein or its
tributaries.124
Hemodynamic success. The presence or absence of
recurrent reflux in treated incompetent veins should be
documented by duplex scanning, because this represents
technical failure or success of the procedure.126 Changes in
venous hemodynamics of the limb can also be documented
by changes in plethysmographic findings before and after
therapy; hemodynamic results frequently correlate with
clinical outcome.95,127
Safety
The safety of any procedure used for treatment of
varicose veins or more advanced CVD needs to be established, and the procedurally related early adverse effects
(⬍30 days) and late complications should be documented.
Table V defines minor and major complications for reporting purposes.124

Most patients who seek treatment for varicose veins
have symptoms of aching, throbbing, feeling of a heavy leg,
fatigue, cramps, pruritus, restless leg, ankle swelling, and
tenderness or pain along bulging varicose veins. Some will
have history of thrombophlebitis or bleeding from superficial varicose veins or have signs of more advanced CVD,
such as edema, skin changes, including lipodermatosclerosis, eczema, pigmentation, atrophie blanche, corona phlebectatica, and healed or active ulceration. Less frequently,
the veins are of cosmetic concern only.
Medical treatment
Venoactive drugs have been available for treatment of
symptoms of varicose veins and more advanced forms of
CVD for decades, and they have also been used to decrease
ankle swelling and accelerate ulcer healing.128 Many compounds have been tried with varying success, but the most
promising drugs include saponins, such as the horse chestnut seed extract (aescin)129; gamma-benzopyrenes (flavonoids), such as rutosides, diosmin, and hesperidin; the
micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF),130 and
other plant extracts such as French maritime pine bark
extract. Synthetic products include calcium dobesilate, naftazone, and benzarone.131
The principle for the use of venoactive drugs has been
to improve venous tone and capillary permeability, although a precise mechanism of action of most of these
drugs is unknown. Flavonoids appear to affect leukocytes
and the endothelium by modifying the degree of inflammation and reducing edema.56
A recent Cochrane review of 110 publications selected
44 well-documented studies for analysis.132 The metaanalysis found that there appeared to be an effect on edema
and on restless leg syndrome. Diosmin, hesperidin, and
MPFF have been the most effective venoactive drugs. Calcium dobesilate reduced cramps and restless legs. Diosmin
and hesperidin helped healing of trophic skin changes and
were useful in treatment of cramps and swelling. Rutosides
decreased venous edema. This meta-analysis, however,
concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the
global use of venoactive drugs in the treatment of CVD.132

We recommend that the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score is used for
assessment of clinical outcome after therapy for varicose veins and more
advanced chronic venous disease.
We recommend that quality-of-life assessment is performed with a
disease-specific instrument to evaluate patient-reported outcome and
the severity of chronic venous disease.
We recommend duplex scanning for follow-up of patients after venous
procedures who have symptoms or recurrence of varicose veins.
We recommend reporting procedure-related minor and major
complications after therapy.

Horse chestnut seed extract. A separate Cochrane
review of 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found
that horse chestnut seed extract (aescin) was effective to
decrease edema, pain, and itching.129
Pentoxifylline. The effect of pentoxifylline on ulcer
healing was investigated in an RCT by Dale et al.133 In a
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, complete healing of
venous ulcers was observed in 64% of patients receiving
pentoxifylline and in 53% of the patients receiving placebo.
However, the difference was not statistically significant.
In another RCT, Falanga et al134 investigated the effect
of pentoxifylline on ulcer healing in 133 patients. Patients
who were given 800 mg of pentoxifylline three times a day
healed faster than those receiving placebo (P ⫽ .043). The
median time to complete healing was 100, 83, and 71 days
for placebo, pentoxifylline (400 mg), and pentoxifylline
(800 mg) three times a day, respectively. A higher dose of
pentoxifylline (800 mg three times a day) was more effective than the lower dose, although the higher dose had
more significant gastrointestinal upset. The study concluded that pentoxifylline is effective in accelerating healing
of leg ulcers.
In a more recent RCT, evidence to add pentoxifylline
to a regimen of high-compression therapy to increase the
chances of wound healing was of moderate quality.135
Pentoxifylline increased the proportion of ulcer healing
compared with placebo, although this finding was only
statistically significant (P ⫽ .046) when a secondary adjusted analysis was conducted. Pentoxifylline in an oral dose
of 400 mg three times daily is suggested to patients with
venous ulcers in addition to local care, compression garment, or intermittent compression pump (ICP) in the
venous guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP; GRADE 2B).136
Diosmin and hesperidin. The effect of a combination
of flavonoid drugs, diosmin, and hesperidin, in the form of
MPFF, in addition to compression therapy, was evaluated
on ulcer healing and symptoms of CVD in an RCT by

Guilhou et al.137 Although the overall effect of the drug
when combined with compression therapy, was weak,
among patients with ulcers measuring ⱕ10 cm, more ulcers
healed in the MPFF group than in the placebo group (32%
vs 13%; P ⫽ .028) with a shorter duration of healing (P ⫽
.037). Sensation of heavy leg was less in patients treated
with MPFF (P ⫽ .030).
A meta-analysis of five RCTs that included 723 patients
with venous ulcers was reported by Coleridge-Smith et
al.130 The study found that at 6 months, the chance of
healing an ulcer was 32% better in patients treated with
adjunctive MPFF than in those managed by conventional
therapy alone (relative risk reduction, 32%; 95% CI, 3%70%). These results confirm that venous ulcer healing is
accelerated by MPFF treatment. For patients with persistent venous ulcers, flavonoids, in the form of MPFF given
orally or sulodexide administered intramuscularly and then
orally, are suggested in the ACCP guidelines (GRADE
2B).136 The SVS/AVF Guideline Committee also suggests
that MPFF or pentoxifylline be used for patients with
venous ulcers as an adjuvant therapy to compression to
accelerate ulcer healing (GRADE 2B).
Compression treatment
Compression therapy is the basic and most frequently
used treatment of varicose veins, venous edema, skin
changes, and ulcerations. Compression is recommended to
decrease ambulatory venous hypertension to patients with
CVD in addition to lifestyle modifications that include
weight loss, exercise, and elevation of the legs during the
day whenever possible.
The different forms of ambulatory compression techniques and devices include elastic compression stockings,
paste gauze boots (Unna boot), multilayer elastic wraps,
dressings, elastic and nonelastic bandages, and nonelastic
garments. Pneumatic compression devices (such as an
ICP), applied primarily at night, are also used in patients
with refractory edema and venous ulcers.138 The rationale

We suggest venoactive drugs (diosmin, hesperidin, rutosides, sulodexide, micronized
purified flavonoid fraction, or horse chestnut seed extract [aescin]) for patients
with pain and swelling due to chronic venous disease, in countries where these
drugs are available.
We suggest using pentoxifylline or micronized purified flavonoid fraction, if
available, in combination with compression, to accelerate healing of venous ulcers.

of compression treatment is to compensate for the increased ambulatory venous hypertension. Pressures to
compress the superficial veins in supine patients range from
20 to 25 mm Hg. When upright, pressures of 35 to 40 mm
Hg have been shown to narrow the superficial veins, and
pressures ⬎60 mm Hg are needed to occlude them.139
Varicose veins (CEAP class C2). Reported case series
of patients treated with elastic stockings frequently included the whole spectrum of patients with CVD (CEAP
class C0-C6). Treatment with 30 to 40 mm Hg compression stockings in 112 patients (82% with varicose veins, 52%
with edema, and 7% with healed or active ulcers) resulted in
marked improvement in pain, swelling, skin pigmentation,
activity, and well-being at 16 months after initiation of
therapy, with compliance of 70%.140
A large systematic review of compression hosiery for
uncomplicated simple varicose veins was recently published
by Palfreyman and Michaels.34 They analyzed data of 11
prospective RCTs or systematic reviews, 12 nonrandomized studies, and 2 guidelines. Although compression improved symptoms, the study concluded that evidence is
lacking to support compression garments to decrease progression or to prevent recurrence of varicose veins after
treatment. However, these results could have been confounded by the high number of noncompliant patients
included in these studies.34
The level of compression for patients with class C2
disease is also disputed. A meta-analysis by Amsler and
Blattler141 of 11 RCTs suggested that in healthy patients,
in those with C1 to C3 disease, and in those after varicose
vein surgery, medium compression stockings (⬎20 mm
Hg) may add no benefit over that obtained with a compression of between 10 and 15 mm Hg.
Until further data on appropriate tension of elastic
garments are available, for patients with simple varicose
veins (class C2), the SVS/AVF Guideline Committee suggests graded prescription stockings with an ankle pressure
of 20 to 30 mm Hg (GRADE 2C). The most common
length recommended is knee-high stockings, although
thigh-high stockings and pantyhose are also available and
may be appropriate for many patients. Skin breakdown and

frank necrosis after incorrectly measured or applied garments have been reported.142 The Committee recommends that only those with the necessary skills and training
prescribe stockings for patients with venous disease.
The efficacy of conservative vs surgical treatment for
varicose veins was studied in an RCT by Michaels et al.143
The Randomised Clinical Trial, Observational Study and
Assessment of Cost-Effectiveness of the Treatment of Varicose Veins (REACTIV) trial randomized 246 patients with
simple varicose veins (class C2) to conservative management or surgery. Conservative treatment included lifestyle
advice relating to exercise, leg elevation, management of
weight and diet, and the use of compression hosiery. In the
surgical arm, patients received the same lifestyle advice but
also underwent high ligation, stripping, and phlebectomies. In the first 2 years after treatment, there was a
significant QOL benefit for surgery of 0.083 qualityadjusted life-years (QALY; 95% CI, 0.005-0.16 QALY)
based on the SF-6D score (derived from scores on six
domains of the SF-36) and 0.13 QALY (95% CI, 0.0160.25 QALY) based on the EQ-5D score (a five-dimension
descriptive system of health-related QOL). Considerable
benefits were also seen in symptomatic and anatomic measures. The authors concluded that surgery provides more
symptomatic relief and improvements in QOL than conservative management with compression hosiery and lifestyle modifications in patients with uncomplicated varicose veins.
The cost-effectiveness of conservative vs surgical therapy or sclerotherapy in patients with varicose veins was also
studied in the REACTIV trial.144 Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that surgery was significantly more cost-effective
than both sclerotherapy and conservative management;
sclerotherapy was less cost-effective than surgery but was
still significantly more cost-effective than conservative
treatment.
The need for a period of compression treatment before
any intervention for simple varicose veins has been surrounded
by controversy. Although third-party payers often require a
trial of compression stockings, there is virtually no scientific
evidence to support such a policy when saphenous ablation
to treat superficial reflux is both more efficacious and

JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY

cost-effective, a fact supported by data of the REACTIV
trial. In addition, some patients, such as the obese or the
elderly, may have difficulties applying an elastic stockings.138 One study of predominantly elderly (mean age, 72
years) women with CVD found that 15% could not apply
elastic stockings and 26% needed considerable help to do
so.145 On the basis of the available evidence, the Guideline
Committee recommends against compression therapy being considered the primary treatment of symptomatic varicose veins (class C2) in those patients who are candidates
for saphenous vein ablation (GRADE 1B).
CVI (CEAP classes C3-C6). Compression therapy
remains the standard of care for patients with advanced
CVD and venous ulcers (class C3-C6). Compression therapy improves calf muscle pump function and decreases
reflux in vein segments in patients with CVI.146,147 In
patients with venous ulcers, graded compression is effective
as the primary treatment to aid healing of venous ulceration
and as adjuvant therapy to interventions to prevent recurrence of venous ulcers.148
Compliance with compression therapy is important. In
a cohort study by Mayberry et al,148 results of venous ulcer
treatment in 113 patients treated over 15 years were reported. Ulcer healing with local care and compression
averaged 5.3 months, and was 97% in compliant patients
and 55% in noncompliant patients (P ⬍ .0001). Ulcer
recurrence was 16% in compliant patients and 100% in
noncompliant patients.
A systematic review of 24 RCTs on compression treatment on venous ulcers by Fletcher et al36 concluded that
compression treatment improves the healing of ulcers compared with no compression149 and that high compression is
more effective than low compression.150 The authors
found no evidence that one form of compression treatment
is better than another, although a previously published
single-center experience suggested that low-stretch inelastic bandages were more effective in reducing venous reflux
than elastic bandages.151 The ACCP guidelines suggest the
use of an ICP in addition to a compression garment and
local care for treatment of recalcitrant ulcers.136
A recent meta-analysis by Amsler et al152 examined data
of 692 ulcer patients in eight RCTs and found that ulcer
healing was faster, with an average of 3 weeks, with stockings than with bandages (P ⫽ .0002). Pain, examined in
three studies, was also significantly less with stockings than
with bandages (P ⬍ .0001).
Another systematic review by Partsch et al153 confirmed
(GRADE 1A) that compression bandaging promotes healing
of venous ulcers and that strong-compression hosiery (30 to
40 mm Hg) is more effective than medium- or low-compression stockings (GRADE 1B). This study observed GRADE
1A evidence that 30 to 40 mm Hg compression hosiery
prevents recurrence of ulceration after healing. A recent evidence summary on ulcers by Coleridge-Smith154 supported
these recommendations.
An RCT by Milic et al155 compared treatment with
tubular compression (35 mm Hg) vs compression bandages (25 mm Hg) in 138 patients with extensive venous

ulceration (ulceration surface, 20-210 cm2; duration, 7
months-28 years). The authors observed a healing rate of
93% in the treatment group vs 51% in the control group
(P ⬍ .001). The recurrence rate at 12 months was 24% in
the treatment group and 53% in the control group (P ⬍
.05). After additional compression treatment with the same
treatment protocol, all 16 recurrent ulcers in the treatment
group healed. In the control group, the healing rate of
recurrent ulcers was 89%. This study suggests that for
extensive and long-standing venous ulceration, multilayer
tubular compression therapy improves healing and decreases but does not prevent ulcer recurrence.
The Effect of Surgery and Compression on Healing
And Recurrence (ESCHAR) study156,157 randomized 500
patients with leg ulcers to compression treatment alone or
compression combined with superficial venous surgery.
Compression consisted of multilayer compression bandaging, followed by class 2 (medium compression, 18-24 mm
Hg, British Standard158) below-knee stockings. Superficial
venous surgery included saphenous vein ablation with high
ligation and stripping (HL/S) as well as avulsion of varicose
veins of the calf. General anesthesia could not be used in
25% of the patients, and in these, high saphenous vein
ligation alone was performed.
Compression treatment alone was as effective as compression with surgery to heal venous ulcers (65% vs 65%;
hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-1.24; P ⫽ .85), but
12-month ulcer recurrence rates were reduced in the compression with surgery group vs those with compression
alone (12% vs 28%; hazard ratio, ⫺2.76; 95% CI, ⫺1.78 to
⫺4.27; P ⬍ .0001). The difference in ulcer recurrence rates
persisted between the two groups at 4 years.159 A weakness
of the trial was that there was no surgical arm without
compression. This was unfortunate, because there is some
evidence that saphenous vein disconnection improves venous function and heals venous ulcers, even without compression bandaging, if the deep veins are normal.160
A meta-analysis and Cochrane Collaboration review of
42 RCTs by Palfreyman et al42,161 searched for evidence of
effectiveness of dressings applied to venous leg ulcers in
addition to compression. The authors concluded that there
is no evidence that hydrocolloid or other dressings beneath
compression are more effective than compression alone.
On the basis of high-quality clinical evidence, the
Guideline Committee recommends compression therapy
for patients with CVI (class C3-C6), including those with
leg ulcers. Compression therapy is now considered the
primary therapy to aid in healing venous ulcers (GRADE
1B) and the adjuvant therapy to superficial vein ablation to
prevent ulcer recurrence (GRADE 1A).
Open venous surgery
Open surgical treatment of varicose veins with ligation
and stripping of the GSV or SSV, combined with excision
of large varicose veins, has been the standard of care of
varicose vein treatment for more than a century. Invagination stripping was first attempted by Keller162 in 1905,
Charles Mayo in 1906163 used an external stripper to

remove the saphenous veins, and Babcock in 1907164
introduced intraluminal stripping from the ankle to the
groin. High ligation and ankle-to-groin stripping using a
metal or, later, a disposable Codman or Myers stripper has
become the technique of choice to remove the saphenous
vein. Recognition of frequent saphenous nerve injury during ankle-to-groin stripping and a better understanding of
the venous hemodynamics changed the technique to a
limited, groin-to-knee stripping.165
The invagination technique using a silk thread was
perfected by Van Der Stricht166 and using the Myers stripper, without the acorn-shaped head, by Fullarton and Calvert,167 while perforate invaginate (PIN) stripping was
introduced by Oesch168 and perfected in the United States
by Goren and Yellin.169 Varicose vein excision performed
from multiple larger skin incisions170,171 was also abandoned, and ambulatory hook phlebectomy172,173 and
powered phlebectomy174-176 have been adopted.
During the past decade, endovenous thermal ablation
has largely replaced the classic ligation and stripping operation, and open surgery for saphenous incompetence is
performed much less frequently in the United States. Indications for ligation and stripping have been restricted to
patients with large dilated and tortuous saphenous vein
located immediately under the skin or to those with aneurysmal enlargement at the SFJ. Because of previous thrombophlebitis of the GSV or SSV, percutaneous placement of
the laser fiber or radiofrequency (RF) catheter may not be
possible, and open techniques have to be used for removal
of the vein.
It is important to note, however, that the technique of
open surgery has also changed substantially in recent years,
and today a much less invasive procedure is performed to
treat the incompetent saphenous veins than at anytime
before. The groin incision is small, the incision at the knee
for inversion stripping is either a puncture wound (PIN
stripping) or a small stab wound, and the operation is
performed under local tumescent anesthesia with increasing frequency.177 Although endothermal ablations are fa-

vored in the United States, in many countries conventional
surgery remains the standard of care of patients with varicose veins.178
High ligation, division, and stripping of the
GSV. The term high ligation and division implies ligation
and division of the GSV at its confluence with the common
femoral vein, including ligation and division of all upper
GSV tributaries.51 Partial or complete preservation of the
upper GSV tributaries, when the GSV is ligated, stripped,
or ablated, must therefore be clearly stated. The term
stripping means removal of a long vein segment, usually of
the saphenous vein, by means of a device.51
The SFJ is dissected through a 3- to 4-cm-long oblique
incision made in the groin crease just lateral to the femoral
artery. The cosmetic appearance of the scar of such an
incision is excellent. The SFJ is dissected bluntly and
sharply, minimizing injury to the surrounding lymphatic
tissue to avoid lymphatic leak or lymphedema. The anterior
wall of the common femoral vein is always visualized to
ensure accurate ligation of the SFJ. All tributaries are ligated and divided, preferably to the secondary branches,177
although firm evidence to support the need for this is not
available. During dissection of the SFJ, the external pudendal artery is carefully preserved. Flush ligation of the saphenous vein is performed by double-ligating the vein with
nonabsorbable suture close to the SFJ. It is important to
avoid narrowing the femoral vein but equally important to
minimize chances for a cul-de-sac in the saphenous vein
stump.
To perform stripping, a flexible Codman stripper is
often used for invagination stripping, without the removable acorn. The saphenous vein is tied to the tip of the
stripper, and the vein is inverted into its lumen as the
stripper is pulled down through a small incision made
below the knee. Alternatively, an Oesch PIN stripper can be
used.168,169 Saphenous stripping below the knee is rarely
performed today because of an increased incidence of reported saphenous nerve injury.165 To decrease bleeding in
the saphenous tunnel after stripping, we suggest that the

22S Gloviczki et al

perisaphenous space be infiltrated with tumescent anesthetic solution.
The operation is usually completed with a miniphlebectomy to remove the bulging varicose veins through a small
stab wound. The incisions are then infiltrated with tumescent solutions, the groin incision is closed in layers with
nonadsorbable sutures, and the stab wounds are closed
with sterile adhesive strips. The extremity is bandaged with
an elastic bandage to decrease the risk of bleeding and to
decrease swelling and pain. The operation is an outpatient
procedure.
High ligation, division, and stripping of the SSV.
Complete stripping of the SSV is rarely performed today
because of possible injury to the sural nerve, but ligation of
the SSV through a small transverse incision in the popliteal
crease can be performed together with a limited invagination stripping of the vein to the mid calf, using the same
technique described for GSV stripping. The safest technique to identify the SSV is intraoperative duplex scanning.
There is no evidence that flush ligation is better than simple
ligation of the vein when performed at a location closer to
the skin, usually right in the knee crease. We recommend
ligation of the SSV at this level, about 3 to 5 cm distal to the
saphenopopliteal junction, since this can be performed
through a very small skin incision and it avoids the need for
deep dissection in the popliteal fossa, with the potential for
associated wound complications or nerve injury.
Cryostripping of the GSV. To decrease hemorrhage
within the saphenous tunnel and avoid any incision placed
at the level of the knee, the technique of cryostripping has
been suggested by some investigators.179 Cryostripping is
an alternative method to invagination stripping.180 The
technique is new in the United States and has not been fully
evaluated.
For cryostripping, a cryosurgical system (Erbokryo CA,
ERBE Elektromedizin GmbH, Tübingen, Germany),
powered by liquid nitrogen, is used. After high ligation is
completed, the cryoprobe is inserted into the saphenous
vein and passed down to the level of the knee. As soon as
the probe tip reaches the desired segment of the GSV,
freezing is initiated. After the freezing cycle is maintained
for a couple of seconds, the GSV is invaginated with an
upward tug and is stripped toward the groin.
Phlebectomy
Ambulatory phlebectomy. Ambulatory phlebectomy
(stab or hook phlebectomy or miniphlebectomy) includes
removal or avulsion of varicose veins through small stab
wounds, made with a No. 11 Beaver blade or a 15° ophthalmologic blade, or through the puncture hole made
with a larger, 19-gauge needle. Avulsion of the varicose
veins is performed with hooks or forceps.172,173 The
most widely known hooks are Müller, Oesch, Tretbar,
Ramelet, Varady, and Dortu-Martimbeau phlebectomy
hooks.172,173,181 The veins are marked before surgery on
the patient’s skin with a marker, with the patient standing.
The operation is usually performed under tumescent local
anesthesia, using a solution of 445 mL of 0.9% saline, 50

JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY
May Supplement 2011

mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, and 5 mL
of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate.181
A rigid cannula with a light source can be used to inject
the tumescent solution and also to transilluminate the
subcutaneous tissues under the varicose veins.182 Injection
of the tumescent solution can be performed using a large
syringe or a Klein infiltration pump.181,183 Digital compression is applied immediately, and infiltration of the
wound with tumescent solution also provides good hemostasis. The skin incisions are usually approximated with
sterile adhesive strips, and compression is applied to the
extremity from foot to groin with an elastic compression
bandage or compression stocking.
Powered phlebectomy. Transilluminated powered phlebectomy (TIPP; Trivex, InaVein, Lexington, Mass), an
alternative technique for the removal of varicose veins, is
especially useful for the removal of larger clusters of varicosities.184,185 The potential advantages of TIPP include a
decrease in the number of incisions and much faster removal of a large amount of varicose vein tissue. Just as for
ambulatory phlebectomy, TIPP is often combined with
saphenous vein ablation procedures or stripping and ligation to eliminate the source of the reflux underlying a
varicose venous cluster formation. Instrumentation includes a central power unit with controls for irrigation
pump and resection oscillation speeds, an illuminator hand
piece that connects to the control unit using a fiber optic
cable and provides high-intensity light for transillumination
and delivery of tumescence irrigation, and a resector hand
piece that has 4.5-mm and 5.5-mm options.
General, epidural, or spinal anesthesia can be used,
depending on patient preference, while local tumescence
anesthesia and conscious sedation may be options for limited varicosities in selected patients. In the procedure, TIPP
instruments are introduced through tiny incisions. The
illuminator produces transilluminated visualization of the
veins to be removed, allows delivery of tumescent anesthetic solution, and performs hydrodissection. Through
segmental counterincisions under direct visualization, the
resector is positioned directly on the varicosity, and with
powered endoscopic dissection, varicosities are mobilized
free and then suctioned out of the leg. The addition of small
1.5-mm punch incisions allows for blood that collects in
the vein tract to be flushed out with further tumescent
anesthetic fluid.184-186
Preservation of the GSV. Preservation of the saphenous vein and treatment of varicose tributaries by phlebectomy has been advocated by Francesci in the CHIVA (cure
conservatrice et hémodynamique de l’insuffisance veineuse en
ambulatiore [ambulatory conservative hemodynamic management of varicose veins]) technique186-189 and by Pittaluga in the ASVAL (ablation sélective des varices sous anesthésie locale [ie ambulatory selective varicose vein ablation
under local anesthesia]) technique.126
The CHIVA technique. The CHIVA technique is a
hemodynamic approach to varicose veins based on the
principles of preserving the saphenous vein and venous
drainage into the deep system.186,190 The goal of CHIVA

JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY
Volume 53, Number 16S

is to decrease the hydrostatic pressure in the saphenous
veins and tributaries by the ligations placed in specific areas
in the superficial venous system and to maintain the drainage function of the superficial veins, usually via a reversed
flow.186 It represents a systematic approach to varicose
veins rather than a single operative procedure.
Several anatomic patterns of reflux have been identified, each requiring a somewhat different operative strategy
based on the underlying anatomy, studied in utmost detail
with duplex scanning.188 A frequently used CHIVA technique presented in an RCT included proximal ligation of
the incompetent saphenous vein; ligation, division, and
avulsion of the incompetent varicose tributaries; and maintaining patency of the saphenous trunk, the competent
saphenous tributaries, and saphenous venous drainage to
the deep system through the so-called reentry perforators.191 A recently published RCT presented further details
of the technique in six different types of varicosity.192
The ASVAL technique. Described by Pittaluga et
al,126 the ASVAL operation includes preservation of the
incompetent saphenous vein and stab phlebectomy of all
varicose tributaries. Most patients operated on with this
technique in one study had a less advanced stage of varicosity (CEAP class C2) and presented with no symptoms in
33% and no trophic skin changes in 91%.126
Perioperative thrombosis prophylaxis. Selective
prophylaxis after risk assessment is warranted in patients
who undergo venous surgery. The risk of DVT is increased
in patients with thrombophilia, in those with a history of
DVT or thrombophlebitis, and in obese patients. Similarly
to the recently published ACCP guidelines,159 we recommend, for patients who do not have additional thromboembolic risk factors, that surgeons not routinely use specific
thromboprophylaxis other than early and frequent ambulation (GRADE 2B). For those with additional thromboembolic risk factors, we recommend thromboprophylaxis
with low-molecular-weight heparin, low-dose unfractionated heparin, or fondaparinux (GRADE 1C).
Results of open venous surgery. Results of open
surgery have continued to improve during the past decades,
and HL/S of the GSV performed as an outpatient procedure is a safe and effective operation. Surgical treatment is
superior to conservative management of varicose veins with
use of elastic garments. In the REACTIV trial,144 as discussed previously, results of surgery with compression
treatment were compared with results of compression treatment alone in 246 patients with uncomplicated varicose
veins.143 Surgical treatment included flush ligation of sites
of reflux, stripping of the GSV, and multiple phlebectomies. At 2 years, surgery provided more symptomatic relief,
better cosmetic results, and much-improved QOL over
conservative management.
Marked improvement in QOL after open surgery was
also demonstrated in an RCT by Rasmussen et al.177 In a
prospective cohort study, Mackenzie et al193 monitored
102 consecutive patients who underwent varicose vein
surgery. At 2 years after surgery, health-related QOL markedly improved to baseline when assessed with the Aberdeen

Gloviczki et al 23S

Varicose Vein Symptom Severity Score and the SF-36.
Improvement in QOL from varicose vein surgery has been
shown to be statistically significant and clinically meaningful, matching the benefits observed after elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.194
Recovery after conventional high ligation and inversion
stripping with associated phlebectomies has been variable
in different reports. In a series of 112 procedures performed
in an office setting under locoregional anesthesia, using
high ligation, PIN stripping, and hook phlebectomy, Goren and Yellin169 reported that all their patients resumed
normal daily and sporting activities immediately after surgery and none had major complications. There was frequent bruising, but no tract hematomas, no nerve damage,
and no DVTs were noted in this series. Follow-up of this
series, however, was poor and the quality of evidence of
treatment efficacy was low.
In an RCT that compared high ligation, stripping, and
phlebectomy with RFA and phlebectomy, the open surgical
group at 3 weeks had a 2.8% wound infection rate, 19.4% of
the patients had ecchymosis, 33.3% had hematoma, and
5.6% had paresthesias.195 Most importantly, time to return
to normal activities averaged 3.89 days (95% CI, 2.67-5.12
days; P ⫽ .02), only 46.9% of patients returned to routine
daily activities within 1 day, and the number of days to
return to work averaged 12.4 days (95% CI, 8.66-16.23
days).
HL/S vs high ligation alone. HL/S of the GSV reduced the risk of reoperation by two-thirds at 5 years after
surgery in a prospective randomized study reported by
Dwerryhouse et al.196 The authors randomized 133 legs of
100 patients to high ligation or HL/S. The need for
reoperation was 6% in patients who underwent HL/S vs
20% in those patients who underwent high ligation alone
(P ⬎ .02). The reason for this is that patients with only high
ligation have recurrent reflux in the residual GSV, which
causes new symptoms and increases the risk of reoperation.
The effect of saphenous stump closure on outcome. In an
RCT, Frings et al197 found more neovascularization in
patients who had the endothelium of the saphenous stump
exposed vs those who had the saphenous stump oversewn
with a running nonabsorbable polypropylene suture. (Neovascularization has been defined as the presence of multiple
new small tortuous veins in anatomic proximity to a previous venous intervention.51) No conclusion could be
reached, however, on the type of suture used to ligate the
stump. Neoreflux was the same after ligature with absorbable suture vs nonabsorbable suture.
An RCT by Winterborn et al198 observed no difference
in varicose vein recurrence if a standard saphenofemoral
ligation (transfixation and ligation using nonabsorbable
suture, with exposed endothelium of the stump) or a flush
saphenofemoral ligation (the stump was oversewn with a
running polypropylene suture, with no endothelium exposed) was used. At 2 years, the recurrence rate was 33% in
the standard group and 32% in the flush group (P ⫽ .90).
Neovascularization was present in 22% in standard group
and in 19% in the flush group (P ⫽ .57).

24S Gloviczki et al

Another RCT on 389 limbs by van Rij et al199 observed
that placement of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patch
over the SFJ halved recurrence at 3 years compared with
controls and that a synthetic patch was an effective mechanical suppressant of neovasculogenesis at the groin. These
findings were not confirmed, however, in a smaller RCT by
Winterborn and Earnshaw.200 This study randomized 40
legs to insertion or no insertion of a PTFE patch over the
ligated SFJ. The overall complication rate was 35% (11
legs), with no statistically significant difference between the
groups. By 2 years postoperatively, duplex imaging showed
neovascularization had developed at the SFJ in 4 of 16 legs
without a patch and in 5 of 16 legs with a patch (P ⫽ 1.0).
We recommend double ligation of the SFJ with nonabsorbable suture (GRADE 1C), but we suggest against using a
PTFE patch to cover the saphenous stump (GRADE 2C).
Complications. Wound complications usually occur in
3% to 10% of patients,178,201 with reported wound infection rates as low as 1.5% and as high as 16%.202-204 An RCT
by Biswas et al205 evaluated the efficacy of the duration of
compression therapy in 300 postsurgical patients. The
study found no benefit in wearing compression stockings
for ⬎1 week after uncomplicated HL/S of the GSV with
respect to postoperative pain, number of complications,
time to return to work, or patient satisfaction for up to 12
weeks after surgery.205
In a recent RCT that included 443 patients who underwent groin surgery for varicose veins, the risk of wound
infections and wound-related complications was reduced
with use of a single dose of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis.206 Wound outcomes were worse with higher body
mass index (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.97; P ⫽ .005) and
with current smoking (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9; P ⫽
.033).206
Nerve injury. Using conventional stripping techniques, the incidence of saphenous nerve injury in one
study was 7% in patients who had stripping to the knee and
39% in those who had stripping to the ankle.165 Sural nerve
injury occurred at a rate of 2% to 4%. Common peroneal
nerve injury occurred in 4.7% in one series and in 6.7% in
another series in those patients who underwent SSV ligation or stripping.207
Injury to the femoral artery and vein. Injury to the
femoral vein or artery during high ligation of the saphenous
vein is, fortunately, very rare. Consequences can be disastrous, because most are not recognized immediately,208
and a delay in treatment may result in massive DVT or even
loss of the limb from the severe arterial injury.
Thromboembolic complications. DVT and pulmonary
embolism (PE) are rare but occasionally serious complications of superficial vein surgery. In a prospective study, Van
Rij209 performed duplex scanning in 377 patients before
surgery and then at 2 to 4 weeks and at 6 to 12 months after
surgery. Acute DVT was detected in 20 patients (5.3%).
Eight were symptomatic and no PE was observed. Although this series suggests an incidence of DVT that is
higher than previously believed, this complication had minimal short-term or long-term clinical significance. Of the

JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY
May Supplement 2011

20 DVTs, 18 were confined to calf veins, and half of the
DVTs had resolved without deep venous reflux at 1 year.
Others reported an incidence of 0.5% for DVT and 0.16%
for PE.201
Conventional stripping vs cryostripping. An RCT by
Menyhei et al179 randomized 160 patients to high ligation,
division, and cryostripping vs conventional stripping. No
differences in QOL measures were noted by the SF-36
questionnaire at 6 months between the two groups. Bruising was more frequent after conventional stripping (P ⫽
.01), but there was no difference in pain score or complications. Two patients from the conventional stripping
group and six from the cryostripping group were excluded
from analysis because of incomplete stripping. Experience
with this technique in the United States is limited, and at
this time no recommendation is made.
Results of superficial vein surgery on ulcer healing
and recurrence. High quality evidence indicates that superficial vein surgery reduces ulcer recurrence. The
ESCHAR study,156,157 as discussed earlier, randomized
500 patients with leg ulcers, who had isolated superficial
venous reflux or mixed superficial and deep reflux, to
compression treatment alone or to compression combined
with superficial venous surgery. Compression consisted of
multilayer compression bandaging, followed by class 2
below-knee stockings. Surgery included high ligation, division, and saphenous stripping. Rates of healing at 24 weeks
were similar in both groups (65% vs 65%; hazard ratio,
0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-1.24; P ⫽ .85), but 12-month ulcer
recurrence rates were reduced in the compression with
surgery group (12% vs 28%; hazard ratio, ⫺2.76; 95% CI,
⫺1.78 to ⫺4.27; P ⬍ .0001). The difference in ulcer
recurrence rates between the two groups at 4 years was
significant.157
Powered phlebectomy vs stab phlebectomy. A limited
number of studies, both retrospective and prospective, have
been performed. Overall, reported complications after
TIPP have varied considerably and include ecchymosis and
hematoma in 4.9% to 95%, paresthesias and nerve injury in
9.5% to 39%, skin perforation in 1.2% to 5%, superficial
phlebitis in 2.4% to 13%, swelling in 5% to 17.5%, hyperpigmentation in 1.2% to 3.3%, residual or recurrent varicose veins in 9.1% to 21.2%, and DVT in ⬍1%.174,210 In a
comparison between TIPP and stab phlebectomy, TIPP
revealed a difference in the number of incisions174 and in
the speed of the procedure.178,179 However, there was no
difference in bruising, cellulitis, and numbness at 1 to 2
weeks; nerve injury, residual veins, cosmesis score, and
overall satisfaction at 6 weeks; and cosmesis or recurrence at
6 and 12 months. A learning curve to determine just how
aggressive the surgeon can be during the procedure to
eliminate all veins while minimizing bruising and other
local complications has also been noted.211,212 These
reports, however, used an early-generation system,
higher oscillation speeds (800-1200 rpm), and minimal
tumescence.
With a newer-generation system and technical modifications incorporating a lower oscillation frequency (300-

JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY
Volume 53, Number 16S

500 rpm), a dermal punch drainage technique, secondary
tumescence with extensive flushing of residual hematoma
and residual venous tissue fragments, and an additional
tertiary subdermal tumescence phase, the results of powered phlebectomy have improved.213 The largest series214
using modified techniques included 339 patients with a
mean operative time of 19.7 minutes, and ⬎60% of cases
involving 10 to 20 incisions. Discoloration of the skin was
noted in eight patients (2.3%), excessive or hypertrophic
scarring in two (0.6%), and cellulitis in one (0.3%). There
were no significant hematomas and no recurrent varicose
veins at 12 weeks in this series, and overall, 99.7% reported
good outcomes and satisfaction.
Although no published data clearly show any statistically significant advantage of TIPP over conventional phlebectomy except for fewer incisions, most published literature represents earlier-generation systems and techniques.
With the newer-generation system and modified technique
and learning curve adjustments, TIPP has become less
traumatic, which may decrease potential complications and
improve outcomes over those previously reported. Until
new trials are performed, any additional potential benefits
of TIPP have yet to be substantiated.
Results with preservation of the saphenous vein. Results
with CHIVA. Two RCTs188,191 compared standard treatment (compression or high ligation, stripping, and phlebectomy) with CHIVA approaches with specific anatomic
patterns of reflux (types I and III shunts). For the specific
venous anatomy evaluated in these trials, such techniques
were better than compression in preventing ulcer recurrence188 and were at least equivalent to stripping of varicose
veins.191
In a single-center RCT, Zamboni et al188 used CHIVA
or compression to treat 47 legs with venous ulcers. At a
mean follow-up of 3 years, healing was 100% (median
healing time, 31 days) in the surgical group and 96%
(median healing time, 63 days) in the compression group
(P ⬍ .02). The recurrence rate was 9% in the surgical group
and 38% in the compression group (P ⬍ .05). The study
excluded patients with post-thrombotic syndrome, deep
vein reflux or obstruction, or excessive ulcers (⬎12 cm).
In a recent open-label, single-center RCT, Pares et
al192 randomized 501 patients with primary varicose veins
into three arms: CHIVA, stripping with clinic marking, and
stripping with duplex marking. The primary end point was
recurrence within 5 years, assessed clinically by independent observers. Clinical outcomes in the CHIVA group
were better (44.3% cure, 24.6% improvement, 31.1% failure) than in the stripping with clinic marking (21.0% cure,
26.3% improvement, 52.7% failure) and stripping with
duplex marking (29.3% cure, 22.8% improvement, 47.9%
failure) groups. The OR between the stripping with clinic
marking and CHIVA groups, of recurrence at 5 years of
follow-up, was 2.64 (95% CI, 1.76-3.97; P ⬍ .001). The
OR of recurrence at 5 years between the stripping with
duplex marking and CHIVA group was 2.01 (95% CI,
1.34-3.00; P ⬍ .001).

Gloviczki et al 25S

Although the first two RCTs focused on a small group
of patients with varicose veins, the trial of Pares et al192
deserves credit for including the full spectrum of patients
with primary varicose veins. CHIVA is a complex approach,
and a high level of training and experience is needed to
attain the results presented in this RCT. However, the
results achieved by a few outstanding interventionists does
not support offering this procedure to all practitioners.
Although CHIVA has called attention to the importance
of directing surgical procedures toward the patient’s
venous anatomy and function, it still requires considerable education of venous interventionists willing to learn
this approach.
Results with ASVAL. Good clinical results have been
reported with the ASVAL procedure in a select group of
patients. After 4 years of follow-up, no reflux or minimal
reflux (⬍500 ms) was found in 66.3% of 303 limbs, and
symptoms improved in 78% and varicose vein recurred in
only 11.5%.126
Current selection criteria for the ASVAL procedure
include patients with mild CVD, with either a competent
terminal valve or segmental saphenous reflux, and no or
minimal symptoms. Most had a GSV diameter ⬍8 mm or
SSV diameter ⬍6 mm. Although promising in this group of
patients with largely cosmetic concerns, the technique is
not generalizable and has not been evaluated in any comparative studies against well-validated surgical techniques
(GRADE 2C).
Recurrent varicose veins. Recurrent varicose veins
after surgical treatment are a serious problem, and many
patients require additional interventions. Surgery for recurrence represents a considerable proportion of the workload
of surgeons operating on varicose veins. The operations are
technically more demanding and complicated than firsttime operations.
Recurrent varicose veins after surgery (REVAS) have
been reported at rates ranging from 6.6% to 37% at 2
years177,215,216 and up to 51% at 5 years.217-222 Most
studies reported 2-year clinical recurrence rates of 20% to
37% after conventional or cryostripping, when residual or
recurrent varicose veins noted by both the patient and the
surgeon were counted.216,220 In a 34-year follow-up study
of 125 limbs, Fischer et al221 noted ultrasonographic evidence of saphenofemoral reflux in 75 limbs (60%). Allegra
et al219 noted a 5-year recurrence rate of 25% in a large
study that included 1326 patients. Despite technically
correct surgery, confirmed with postoperative duplex
scanning, recurrence at the SFJ occurred in 13%, at the
saphenopopliteal junction in 30%, and at both in 36%.
Factors predicting recurrence were SSV reflux, perforating vein incompetence, and post-thrombotic deep vein
incompetence.
A consensus document on REVAS found that the main
reasons for recurrence after surgery were technical and
tactical errors, neovascularization at the groin, and progression of the underlying disease.217 In a multicenter registry
that included 199 limbs of 170 patients with REVAS, the
most frequent sources of recurrent reflux were the SFJ

26S Gloviczki et al

(47.2%), followed by leg perforators (54.7%), neovascularization (20%), and technical failure (19%); both neovascularization and technical failure occurred in 17%, and in 35%,
the cause was uncertain or unknown.215 In a study of 279
limbs with recurrent varicose veins at the groin, Geier et
al223 found a long residual saphenofemoral stump in about
two-thirds of cases, recurrences became apparent after a
mean time interval of 6.3 years, and symptoms occurred
after a mean of 8.5 years.
Evaluation. Treatment of symptomatic recurrent varicose veins should be performed after careful evaluation of
the patient with duplex scanning to assess the etiology,
source, type, and extent of recurrent varicose veins. Sites of
reflux at the SFJ or saphenopopliteal junction and at the
sites of clinically important perforating veins should be
searched. Duplex scanning is excellent in identifying residual saphenous stumps, but it has a sensitivity of 62% and a
positive predictive value of only 26% to identify correctly
the presence of neovascularization.224 Histologic examination is still the gold standard when trying to differentiate
between different types of groin recurrences. If perineal or
medial thigh varicosity suggests pelvic reflux, evaluation
with transvaginal ultrasonography may be used, although
the gonadal and pelvic veins are best evaluated with MR or
contrast venography.225,226
Techniques and results of treatment. Ambulatory
phlebectomy, sclerotherapy, or endovenous thermal ablation of accessory saphenous or perforating veins can be
performed, depending on the source, location, and extent
of recurrence. Conventional open surgery usually involves
repeat disconnection of the SFJ combined with ambulatory
phlebectomy. The SEPS procedure to treat incompetent
perforating veins in patients with advanced disease (class
C5-C6) can be useful. Endovenous thermal ablation can
also be performed to treat persistent great, small, or accessory saphenous veins or perforators, and foam sclerotherapy
has been used successfully, alone or with phlebectomy, to
treat recurrent varicose veins and perforating veins.227
Phlebectomy alone, without repeat ligation of the saphenous stump, was studied by Pittaluga et al228 for treatment of recurrent varicose veins in 473 limbs. After 3 years
of follow-up, those with phlebectomy alone and those with
phlebectomy and stump ligation had similar rates of freedom from inguinal reflux (90.8% vs 92.9%) and from
varicose repeat-recurrence (90.8% vs 91.9%), suggesting
that the increased complications of groin reoperations can
be avoided in some patients.
In a prospective nonrandomized trial, recurrent varicosity was treated by van Groenendael et al229 in 149 limbs
with open surgery and in 67 with EVLA. Wound infections
(8% vs 0%; P ⬍ .05) and paresthesias (27% vs 13%; P ⬍ .05)
were more frequent in the surgery group, whereas the
EVLA group reported more perioperative pain or tightness
(17% vs 31%; P ⬍ .05). Hospital stay in the surgery group
was longer (P ⬍ .05) as was the delay before resuming work
(7 vs 2 days; P ⬍ .0001). At 25 weeks of follow-up, repeat
recurrences were reported in 29% after surgery and in 19%
after EVLA (P ⫽ .511). Similar results were reported by the

JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY
May Supplement 2011

same authors in patients who underwent open surgery or
EVLA for recurrent varicose veins of the SSV.230 These
nonrandomized studies provide only low-quality evidence
that EVLA, when possible to perform, results in lower
complication rates and better socioeconomic outcome in
patients with recurrent varicose veins than open surgery.
Creton and Uhl227 treated 129 limbs with recurrent
varicose veins using foam sclerotherapy with 1% polidocanol combined with surgical treatment. All patients had
phlebectomies, and 20 had repeat ligation of the saphenous
stumps. Foam sclerotherapy combined with surgery resulted in 93% closure of the saphenous stumps and no
recurrent varicose veins. Two patients had asymptomatic
DVT. Another study, by O’Hare et al,231 found no difference in occlusion rate of primary and recurrent varicose
veins (75% vs 72%) at 6 months when treated with ultrasonographically guided foam sclerotherapy.
Endovenous thermal ablations
Endovenous thermal ablation of the saphenous veins is
a relatively new, minimally invasive percutaneous procedure with several advantages over standard open surgery.232 It requires local tumescent anesthesia and is an
outpatient procedure that can be performed in an office
setting. The procedure is done under ultrasonographic
guidance using percutaneous catheter placement; patients
complain less of pain and discomfort and return to work
earlier than after open surgical procedures. Endovenous
thermal ablation includes EVLA and RFA (Table VI). A
third technique that recently emerged includes the use of
superheated steam, which destroys the endothelial layer
and causes shrinkage of the collagen.233 Early clinical application, as reported by Milleret et al,233 is promising, but
available data are not sufficient to include this technique in
our report in more detail. EVLA and RFA are similar
techniques in many ways, so a discussion of concepts and
data applying to both of these procedures is appropriate.
Occlusion (ablation) of the treated vein is achieved by
heat delivered into the vein through the percutaneously
placed laser fiber or an RF catheter. Endovenous thermal
ablation causes a direct thermal injury to the vein wall,
resulting in destruction of the endothelium, collagen denaturation of the media, and fibrotic and thrombotic occlusions of the vein. The endothermal ablations by laser also
provide direct heat injury to the blood.234 Blood coagulates at 70°C to 80°C, steam bubbles form at 100°C, and
carbonization of coagulum is observed at 200°C to 300°C.
Currently available laser fibers include hemoglobin-specific
laser wavelengths (810, 940, and 980 nm) and waterspecific laser wavelengths (1319, 1320, and 1470 nm).
Laser treatment was first recommended by Puglisi235 in
1989, but it was 10 years later that Boné236 reported the
first successful clinical application of a diode laser for the
treatment of varicose veins. Boné et al237reported EVLA
first in the English literature in 2001, and the technique was
soon adopted and perfected in the United States and
worldwide.7,238-250

For treatment of the incompetent great saphenous vein, we suggest high ligation
and inversion stripping of the saphenous vein to the level of the knee.
To reduce hematoma formation, pain, and swelling, we recommend postoperative
compression. The recommended period of compression in C2 patients is 1 week.
For treatment of small saphenous vein incompetence, we recommend high ligation
of the vein at the knee crease, about 3 to 5 cm distal to the saphenopopliteal
junction, with selective invagination stripping of the incompetent portion of the
vein.
To decrease recurrence of venous ulcers, we recommend ablation of the
incompetent superficial veins in addition to compression therapy.
We suggest preservation of the saphenous vein using the ambulatory conservative
hemodynamic treatment of varicose veins (CHIVA) technique only selectively in
patients with varicose veins, when performed by trained venous interventionists.
We suggest preservation of the saphenous vein using the ambulatory selective
varicose vein ablation under local anesthesia (ASVAL) procedure only selectively
in patients with varicose veins.
We recommend ambulatory phlebectomy for treatment of varicose veins,
performed with saphenous vein ablation, either during the same procedure or at
a later stage. If general anesthesia is required for phlebectomy, we suggest
concomitant saphenous ablation.
We suggest transilluminated powered phlebectomy using lower oscillation speeds
and extended tumescence as an alternative to traditional phlebectomy for
extensive varicose veins.
For treatment of recurrent varicose veins, we suggest ligation of the saphenous
stump, ambulatory phlebectomy, sclerotherapy, or endovenous thermal ablation,
depending on the etiology, source, location, and extent of varicosity.

The use of RF for saphenous ablation was approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999,
and the first reports were published in 2000.251-253 Experience with RF rapidly accumulated,8,195,246,254-259 although the first-generation device was somewhat cumbersome to use. The current ClosureFast RF catheter (VNUS
Medical Technologies, San Jose, Calif), introduced in
2007, is more user-friendly, and treatment with it is faster
than with the first-generation device.260 This rendition
does not need an irrigation system, and the entire pullback

procedure takes 3 to 4 minutes. A second RFA system for
bipolar RF-induced thermotherapy, Celon RFITT, is now
available in Europe (Olympus Medical Systems, Hamburg,
Germany).261 This system generates heat at 60°C to 85°C
and operates with a continuous pullback technique at a
pullback speed of 1 cm/s. Clinical studies to investigate the
efficacy of this device are under way.
Patient selection. To select the right patient for endovenous thermal ablation, thorough preprocedural duplex ultrasonography must be performed. The identifica-

28S Gloviczki et al

tion of all refluxing venous segments and their ablation
during the procedure is the key to minimizing recurrence of
varicose veins. Inappropriate vein size (⬍2 mm and ⬎15
mm for RFA), a history of superficial thrombophlebitis
resulting in a partially obstructed saphenous vein, and the
uncommon occurrence of a tortuous GSV on duplex examination are potential contraindications. Patients with ropy
varicose veins located immediately under the skin or those
with aneurysmal dilations of the SFJ are probably better
served with conventional high ligation, division, and stripping. Those with extensive deep venous occlusion should
undergo superficial ablation selectively, because superficial
veins in these patients may be important for venous outflow
from the leg.
There are no absolute contraindications to EVLA, including vein diameter, although Lawrence et al262 have
recently suggested an association of central GSV diameter ⬎8 mm with increased risk of extension of thrombus
into the femoral vein. Other relative contraindications to
endovenous saphenous vein ablation (EVLA or RFA)
include uncorrectable coagulopathy, liver dysfunction
limiting local anesthetic use, immobility, pregnancy, and
breastfeeding.
Technique. The techniques of vein ablations using
EVLA or RFA are similar. For GSV ablation, the patient is
placed in the reverse Trendelenburg position first, and the
GSV is accessed percutaneously under ultrasonographic guidance using a micropuncture needle inserted into the vein just
distal to the knee. Treatment is usually limited to the abovethe-knee segment of the vein to avoid injury to the saphenous
nerve, which is close to the saphenous vein in the calf (Fig 1).
A microguidewire is inserted in the vein, followed by placement of a 4F microsheath. With the help of a floppy
guidewire, the sheath is exchanged for a 5F sheath, allowing placement of the laser fiber or for an 11-cm-long 7F
sheath for placement of the RF catheter.
The laser fiber or RF probe is introduced through the
sheath into the GSV and advanced proximally to the SFJ.
The tip of the catheter is then positioned 1 cm distal to the
confluence with the superficial epigastric vein or 2 cm distal
to the SFJ. The patient is then placed in the Trendelenburg
position and the vein emptied by elevation and compression by instillation of perivenous tumescent anesthesia with
a diluted anesthetic solution (100-300 mL of the 500-mL
solution of 445 mL of 0.9N saline, 50 mL of 1% lidocaine
with 1:100,000 epinephrine, and 5 mL of 8.4% sodium
bicarbonate)232 into the saphenous subcompartment. The
vein can be further compressed by applying negative pressure in the side port with a 20-mL syringe. Tumescent
anesthesia enhances contact of the vein wall with the catheter or laser fiber for therapeutic effectiveness and provides
analgesia and a heat sink around the treated vein, thereby
decreasing heat-related injury to surrounding tissues,
which is reflected in a lower incidence of skin burns and
paresthesias.
The vein is then ablated in a retrograde fashion to just
above the puncture site. The laser fiber is withdrawn at a
rate of 1 to 2 mm/s for the first 10 cm and 2 to 3 mm/s for

JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY
May Supplement 2011

the remaining distance. For optimal treatment, 50 to 80
J/cm energy is delivered when using the 810-nm diode
laser. With the RF catheter system, sequential heating of
the vein is performed at 7-cm intervals, heating the vein to
120°C in each 20-second cycle. The first segment is treated
twice. At the end of the procedure, the saphenous vein is
reimaged to confirm successful obliteration and absence of
thrombus protrusion into the femoral vein or, if the SSV
was treated, into the popliteal vein. If a patent segment is
identified, re-treatment is advisable.
Postprocedural care. Graduated compression stockings with an ankle pressure of 30 to 40 mm Hg or an elastic
or nonelastic wrap is placed on the leg at the end of the
procedure. Early ambulation is encouraged, and the patient
leaves for home a few hours after the procedure. Recent
evidence supports elastic compression for at least 1 week
after superficial venous interventions.205 During this time,
the patient is asked to have compression of the leg day and
night. Although the risk of DVT, heat-induced thrombus
extension, or PE is rare263,264 and therefore the yield is low,
we suggest postprocedural duplex scanning within 24 to 72
hours to exclude any thrombotic complication. Evidence to
support this recommendation is of low quality (GRADE
2C).
Thrombosis prophylaxis. Data to support the routine administration of thromboprophylaxis with heparin are
not available. Selected patients with a history of thrombophlebitis, DVT, known thrombophilia, or obesity are candidates for thrombosis prophylaxis.159 In one case series,
age ⬎50 years was a predictor of heat-induced thrombus
extension into the femoral vein.246 Lawrence et al262 reported 500 patients who underwent RFA, and 13 (2.6%)
experienced thrombus bulging into the femoral vein or
adherent to its wall, which was treated with low-molecularweight heparin. All of these patients had thrombus retraction to the level of the SFJ in an average of 16 days. A
significantly higher rate of proximal thrombus extension
was noted in those patients with a history of DVT and in
those with a GSV diameter of ⬎8 mm (P ⬍ .02).
For high-risk patients, several interventionists use a
single, preventive dose of low-molecular-weight heparin
before or at the beginning of the procedure, although data
on the effectiveness of such prophylaxis are not available.246
Performing the operation as an outpatient procedure under
local or tumescent anesthesia permits early ambulation that
decreases the risk of thromboembolic complications. In
addition, the use of elastic compression and frequent leg
elevation are also aimed at prevention of DVT or PE.
Results of EVLA. Early results from Navarro et al237
in 40 patients confirmed 100% saphenous occlusion at 4.2
months and suggested rapid and widespread use of this
therapy. Min et al266 reported 3-year results in 499 legs
treated with laser, demonstrating a saphenous occlusion
rate of 93%. In a large single-center cohort study, Myers
and Jolley264 treated 509 limbs with an 810-nm laser
during a 5-year period. The rate of primary occlusion at 4
years was 76%, and the secondary occlusion rate was 97%. A
systematic review of EVLA for varicose veins by Mundy et

JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY
Volume 53, Number 16S

al7 found an early saphenous occlusion rate of 88% to 100%,
and a review of 13 studies showed evidence of short-term
benefits.
EVLA of the SSV has been described by several
groups.266-268 Proebstle et al260 observed a 100% occlusion rate at 6 months by using a 940-nm diode laser to treat
the SSV in 41 patients. In a prospective cohort study,
Huisman et al267 treated the SSV in 169 limbs with an
810-nm diode laser. The treated length averaged 23 cm
(range, 6-53 cm). Occlusion of the SSV after 3 months was
achieved in 98%.
Knipp et al268 reported a 1-year saphenous occlusion
rate of 95.9% in 460 limbs treated with 810-nm EVLA and
observed sustained improvement using the VCSS. These
authors also found that outcomes were not affected by the
presence or absence of deep vein insufficiency.
Complications. In an international endovascular
working group registry that included 3696 procedures,
bruising after EVLA was observed in 75%, paresthesia in
3%, thrombophlebitis in 1.87%, skin burns in 0.46%, and
DVT or endovenous heat–induced thrombosis in
0.27%.263 Only one patient had a PE. In 509 patients
treated with laser by Myers and Jolley,264 thromboembolic
complications occurred in 3%. Knipp et al268 observed a
DVT rate of 2.2% in patients who underwent EVLA with
phlebectomy or perforator ligation and a thrombus extension rate into the femoral veins of 5.9%. When EVLA alone
was performed, there was 0% true DVT but a high thrombus extension rate (7.8%) into the femoral vein. The riskadjusted thrombosis prevention protocol in this study had
no effect on thrombus extension rate into the femoral vein.
Puggioni et al246 observed a 2.3% rate of thrombus extension into the femoral vein after EVLT.
Laser treatment of the SSV may result in sural nerve
paresthesia, with an incidence of 1.3% in the series of
Huisman et al.267 Superficial thrombophlebitis developed
in 6 of 169 patients (3.5%) in this study, but serious
complications did not occur.
Laser wavelength, radial fiber, and efficiency. Evidence to support the efficiency of higher-wavelength vs
lower-wavelength laser fibers has been controversial. A
prospective, randomized, single-center, single-surgeon
trial evaluated lasers with 810- or 980-nm wavelengths.243
Thirty legs were treated for each group by a surgeon
blinded for the type of laser. Patients in the 980-nm group
showed less bruising than those in the 810-nm group (P ⬍
.005). Saphenous occlusion rates at 1 year, however, were
identical, and no major complications occurred in either
group. Studies by Proebstle et al240 and Pannier et al,269
however, suggest that laser light with longer wavelengths
(1320-nm Nd:YAG laser, 1470-nm diode laser) may reduce adverse effects without compromising abolition of
reflux.
Another recent development is the introduction of the
ELVeS Radial Fiber, a fiber with a radial emitting laser tip
(Biolitec AG, Jena, Germany), which may decrease the
amount of energy required to occlude the vein, thus decreasing pain and adverse effects of thermal ablations. A

Gloviczki et al 29S

RCT by Doganci and Demirkilic270 compared early occlusion rates of two different laser fibers. The immediate
occlusion rate was 100% for both the 980-nm laser and
bare-tip fiber and the 1470-nm laser with the radial fiber.
Other clinical trials with such fibers are under way.
EVLA vs high ligation, division, and stripping. Seven
RCTs250,265,271-275 compared results of laser ablation with
open high ligation, division, and saphenous stripping. An
RCT by Rasmussen et al265 found no difference in shortterm safety and efficacy or early QOL between EVLA using
a wavelength of 980 nm and HL/S, but EVLA was more
expensive than open surgery. The recurrence rate of varicose veins at 2 years was 33% after high ligation and 26%
after EVLA (P ⫽ NS).177 The study concluded that treatments were equally safe and efficient in eliminating saphenous reflux, alleviating symptoms and signs of varicose
veins, and improving QOL.
Darwood et al271 performed an RCT comparing EVLA
with surgery for treatment of primary varicosity and saphenous incompetence. EVLA and surgery were comparable in
ablation of reflux and in disease-specific QOL, but return to
normal activity averaged a median of 2 days (range, 0-7
days) after EVLA vs 7 days (range, 2-26 days) after surgical
treatment (P ⫽ .001). Return to work was 4 days (range,
2-7 days) after EVLA vs 17 days (range, 7.25-33.25 days)
after surgery (P ⫽ .005), suggesting important socioeconomic advantages for EVLA. These RCTs177,271 both
found a tendency toward less bruising and pain with EVLA
than with surgery.
In a single-center RCT, de Medeiros and Luccas272
compared EVLA using an 810-nm laser with stripping in
20 patients who had bilateral saphenous incompetence.
Each patient served as his or her own control. There was
significantly less edema and bruising early after the laser
procedure, but at 2 years, no difference was noted in
esthetic results, patient satisfaction, or pain, and the authors
concluded that midterm results of laser were comparable to
surgery.
Vuylsteke et al273 randomized 164 patients to EVLA
(80 patients) or HL/S (84 patients). Patient follow-up
lasted an average of 9 months after surgery. The study
found shorter duration of postoperative disability after
EVLA than after surgical treatment (8.6 vs 22.4 days; P ⬍
.05).
Kalteis et al274 reported results of a single-center RCT
comparing laser ablation (810-nm laser) with stripping of
the GSV in 100 patients, including high ligation and phlebectomies performed in both groups. Follow-up was 4
months. Fewer postoperative hematomas occurred in the
laser group, but pain and sick leave time after EVLA were
longer than after surgery (20 days vs 14 days; P ⬍ .05). The
study concluded that short-term QOL is equal after both
procedures but that longer follow-up is needed to decide
which is a better choice for the patients.
Pronk et al275 compared HL/S with EVLA using a
980-nm laser energy; 130 legs in 121 patients were randomized. In this study, more pain was noted after EVLA at
days 7, 10, and 14 (P ⬍ .01; P ⬍ .01; P ⫽ .01), more

30S Gloviczki et al

hindrance in mobility at days 7 (P ⬍ .01) and 10 (P ⫽ .01),
and in self-care (P ⫽ .03) and daily activities (P ⫽ .01) at
day 7 compared with HL/S. Recurrence at 1 year was
similar in the two groups.
Christenson et al250 recently reported 2-year data of an
RCT using 980-nm laser for EVLA and compared results
with HL/S in 204 randomized patients. Additional phlebectomies or perforator ligations were also performed in
both groups. HL/S limbs had significantly more postoperative hematomas than EVLT limbs. Two GSVs in the
EVLT group reopened and five partially reopened, but no
open GSVs occurred in HL/S limbs. The authors concluded that long-term follow-up is still needed to justify
EVLA vs HL/S.
The Committee noted that four of the seven trials had
short follow-up and two trials had funding from a commercial company. Overall, the quality of evidence for safety and
early efficacy was high, but evidence for long-term effectiveness in these randomized studies was of low quality.
Perioperative pain was higher in the EVLA groups in two
studies, but postoperative hematomas were less frequent.
As also stated by Thakur at al,276 meaningful comparison
across randomized studies of endovenous treatments is
difficult because of considerable variations in study populations and outcome measures between trials.
Results of RFA. Nicolini277 reported 3-year results
after RFA using the first-generation device in 330 limbs and
observed a total occlusion rate of 75%, partial occlusion
(⬍5-cm open segment) in 18%, and incomplete occlusion
(⬎5-cm open segment) in 7%. The total occlusion rate in
multiple studies using the first-generation device ranged
from 75% to 92%, with a partial occlusion rate of between
7% and 26%.195,257,278,279
Long-term results of the Closure Study Group at 5
years after RFA using the same device were published by
Merchant et al254 in 2005. The multicenter prospective
registry comprised data from ⬎1200 treated limbs. Occlusion rates at 1, 2, and 5 years were 87.1%, 88.2%, and
87.2%, respectively. Duplex ultrasonography identified 185
limbs that had one of the following modes of anatomic
failure:
Type I failure (nonocclusion): The treated vein failed to
occlude initially and never occluded during the follow-up
(12.4%).
Type II failure (recanalization): The vein occluded after
treatment but recanalized, partly or completely, at a later
time (69.7%).
Type III failure (groin reflux): The vein trunk occluded, but reflux was detected at the groin region, often
involving an accessory vein (17.8%).
Relief from symptoms (pain, fatigue, and edema) was
noted in most patients; 70% to 80% of those with anatomic
failure remained asymptomatic compared with 85% to 94%
of those with anatomic success. Type II and type III failures
were risk factors for varicose vein recurrence. In addition,
catheter pullback speed and body mass index were the two
risk factors associated with anatomic failures.

JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY
May Supplement 2011

Early results of the new-generation RF catheter were
reported by Proebstle et al.260 A prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter study treated 252 GSVs, with an occlusion rate at 6 months of 99.6%. Return to normal daily
activities took place on the same day in more than half the
patients, with an average time of 1.0 days (standard deviation, 1.9; median, 0 days; range, 0-17 days).
Complications. Serious complications from RFA, such
as DVT or thermal skin injury, were not observed in a
multicenter, nonrandomized study of RFA using the newgeneration RF catheter system.260 Paresthesia occurred in
3.2%, thrombophlebitis in 0.8%, ecchymosis along the
course of the GSV in 6.3%, and skin pigmentation in 2%.
Lawrence et al262 reported a 2.6% rate of thrombus extension into the femoral veins after 500 RF procedures. No
femoral DVT occurred. The rate of proximal thrombus
extension was significantly higher in patients with a history
of DVT and in those with a GSV diameter of ⬎8 mm (P ⬍
.02).
RFA vs high ligation, division, and stripping. Four
RCTs compared the results of RFA with those of high
ligation, division, and stripping.195,278,280-282 Rautio et
al278 from Finland reported results of a single-center randomized trial in 28 patients. Results at 3 years from the
same study were reported later by Perälä et al.283 This study
found significantly less pain with faster recovery and earlier
return to work after RFA than after surgery (6.5 days vs
15.6 days). Perioperative costs were higher for RFA ($794
vs $360), but total societal costs were lower ($1401 vs
$1926).
Lurie et al reported results of the Endovenous Radiofrequency Obliteration (Closure procedure) versus Ligation and Stripping (EVOLVeS) study at 4 months195 and at
2 years.256 This international, multicenter, prospective
study randomized 85 patients to RFA or HL/S. The RFA
group had faster recovery, less postoperative pain, fewer
adverse events, and superior QOL scores (P ⬍ .05). Clinical
and hemodynamic outcomes of RFA were comparable to
vein stripping at 2 years. The study found that at 2 years,
91.2% of limbs in the RFA group were free of superficial
reflux vs 91.7% in the surgical group (P ⫽ NS).
Stötter et al281 reported results of a single-center RCT
from Germany comparing RFA with PIN stripping or
cryostripping, with 20 patients in each of the 3 groups. At
1 year, RFA showed significantly better results in QOL and
pain assessment, and the authors found significant superiority regarding return to routine activity and work.
Hinchcliffe et al282 reported the results of a singlecenter trial comparing RFA with open surgery in 16 patients with bilateral recurrent GSV varicose veins after
previous bilateral high ligation without stripping. One leg
chosen at random was treated with RFA, the other with
stripping, and both sides had phlebectomies. The time
required to perform RFA was significantly shorter (25 vs 40
minutes), and pain and bruise scores were significantly
lower for RFA than for stripping. Follow-up was 1 year.
The authors concluded that RFA is the technique of choice
to treat the incompetent GSV.

Endovenous thermal ablations (laser and radiofrequency ablations) are safe and
effective, and we recommend them for treatment of saphenous
incompetence.
Because of reduced convalescence and less pain and morbidity, we recommend
endovenous thermal ablation of the incompetent saphenous vein over open
surgery.

The Committee noted that these studies had shortterm to medium-term follow-up, 1 year in two studies, 2
years in one study, and 3 years in the fourth study. RFA
treatment resulted in faster return to work and normal
activities, higher patient satisfaction, less pain, and better
short-term QOL scores, with high-quality evidence confirming early efficacy and safety. The studies, however, did
not report bias protection measures; therefore, the evidence of midterm efficacy is of low quality and no evidence
is available on long-term efficacy.
Radiofrequency ablation vs endovenous laser ablation. Four RCTs compared RFA with EVLA.255,280,284-286
Morrison255 reported a single-center randomized trial performed in 50 patients with bilateral GSV reflux. One limb
was treated with RFA and the other with EVLA. The
saphenous occlusion rate was 80% with RFA and 66% with
EVLA (P ⫽ NS), and there was no difference in early
complication rates.
In the prospective, industry-sponsored, multicenter
Radiofrequency Endovenous ClosureFAST versus Laser
Ablation for the Treatment of Great Saphenous Reflux:
A Multicenter, Single-blinded, Randomized Study
(RECOVERY) trial, Almeida et al286 randomized 87
limbs to treatment with RF catheter or 980-nm EVLA.
There were no major complications. All scores referable
to pain, ecchymosis, and tenderness were statistically
lower in the catheter group at 48 hours, 1 week, and 2
weeks. Minor complications were more prevalent in the
EVLA group (P ⫽ .02). VCSS and QOL measures were
lower in the catheter group at all evaluations.286
In a similar trial, Shepherd et al285 randomized 131
patients to treatment with a new-generation RF catheter or
980-nm EVLA. Perioperative pain was less after RFA than
after laser, but clinical and QOL improvements were similar
in both groups at 6 weeks.
A recent RCT by Gale et al284 compared results of
810-nm wavelength laser with RFA. All veins were closed at
1 week after the procedure. The recanalization rate at 1 year
was significantly higher in the RF group (ClosureFAST
system) than after laser (11 of 48 vs 2 of 46, P ⫽ .002). The
mean VCSS score change from baseline to 1 week postpro-

cedure was higher for RFA than EVLA (P ⫽ .002), but
there was no difference between groups at 1 month (P ⫽
.07) and 1 year (P ⫽ .9). The authors concluded that both
methods of endovenous ablation effectively reduce symptoms of superficial venous insufficiency. EVLA was associated with greater bruising and discomfort in the perioperative period but may provide a more secure long-term
closure than RFA.
The Committee noted that the data support less bruising and less pain with the new RF catheter system than with
the 980-nm EVLA. However, further trials with higherwavelength EVLA, as well as with long-term follow-up, are
needed before any conclusion on the use of any EVLA vs
RFA can be made.
Hemodynamic improvement after saphenous ablations. In a comparative nonrandomized study, Marston et
al287 observed both hemodynamic and clinical improvement in patients treated by either RFA or laser. These
authors reported significant improvements in venous filling
time and in VCSS, with no differences between the groups.
Sclerotherapy
Injection of a chemical into the vein to achieve endoluminal fibrosis and obstruction of the vein has been used
for almost a century.288 Sigg et al,289,290 Fegan et al,291,292
Tournay,293 and Wallois294 are considered the pioneers of
liquid sclerotherapy, whereas Hobbs295 was the first to
provide scientific evidence on the clinical outcome after
sclerotherapy compared with surgery. Sclerotherapy in
some European countries, especially in France, has been a
very popular treatment for varicose veins.296-299 Although
liquid sclerotherapy has been used primarily for obliteration
of spider veins or telangiectasia (veins ⱕ3 mm in diameter),
interest in the use of sclerotherapy greatly increased when
Cabrera et al300 reported in 1995 that foam prepared by
mixing a “physiologic gas” with the detergent polidocanol
was effective for obstruction of larger veins. Ultrasonographically guided foam sclerotherapy has rapidly spread
for treatment of primary and recurrent varicose veins, including the GSV and SSV, perforating veins, and venous
malformations.301-311

Sclerosing agents. The mechanisms of action of sclerosing solutions are the destruction of venous endothelial
cells, exposure of subendothelial collagen fibers, and ultimately, the formation of a fibrotic obstruction. The higher
the concentration of the solution and the smaller the vein,
the greater the endothelial damage. Delivery of the solution
as a foam prolongs the time of contact and amplifies the
effect of the chemical. In the United States, current FDAapproved agents for sclerotherapy include sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS), polidocanol, sodium morrhuate, and
glycerin, which is usually used with epinephrine. Hypertonic saline, although not approved for sclerotherapy in the
United States, has also been used for many years (Table
VII).
Osmotic agents. Hypertonic saline is a weak hyperosmolar sclerosing agent that causes dehydration of endothelial cells through osmosis, which leads to endothelial cell
death. The usual concentration is used in 23.4% sodium
chloride. One formulation is manufactured as Sclerodex
(Omega Laboratories Ltd, Montreal, Quebec, Canada).
Burning pain is frequent during injection. Extravasation
may cause skin ulcers and tissue necrosis, and osmotic
agents are used for occlusion of small veins only.
Detergents. Detergents destroy the endothelium by
denaturation of the cell surface proteins. STS (as Sotrade-

col, Bioniche Pharma USA, Lake Forest, Ill; Fibro-Vein,
STD Pharmaceutical Products Ltd, Hereford, UK; Tromboject, Omega Laboratories) is a long-chain fatty alcohol.
A critical micellar concentration is needed to cause endothelial cell injury, and repeated treatments are frequently
desirable. The solution is safe and painless when injected.
When the solution is injected in higher concentration,
extravasation may result in tissue necrosis. Hyperpigmentation, matting, and allergic reactions have been described.
Foaming of this agent is easy and will result in longer
exposure of the agent to the vein wall using a smaller
amount of the solution.
Polidocanol (Asclera injection, Bioform Medical Inc,
San Mateo, Calif), another detergent, was approved for use
in the United States in 2010. This is the most commonly
used sclerotherapy agent in the world; it is safe and painless
when injected, with a low risk of tissue necrosis when used
in a low concentration. It may cause hyperpigmentation,
but has a very low rate of allergic or anaphylactic reaction.
Morrhuate sodium (Scleromate, Glenwood, LLC,
Englewood, NJ) is a detergent that is used less frequently
because of the relatively higher incidence of skin necrosis
observed with extravasation and because of the higher risk
of anaphylactic reactions.

Alcohol agents. Alcohol agents are weak sclerosants
that cause irreversible endothelial damage by contact. Glycerin is a corrosive agent that destroys the cell surface
proteins by affecting chemical bonds. Chromated glycerin
is used most frequently as a solution of glycerin, sterile
water, and benzyl alcohol (Chromex, Omega Laboratory).
It is not approved in the United States. It is usually mixed
with 1% lidocaine and epinephrine. Chromated glycerin is
safe and rarely leads to tissue necrosis, hyperpigmentation,
or allergy. Suitable for treatment of small veins or telangiectasia, it may cause hematuria when used in a higher
concentration.
Liquid sclerotherapy. The sclerosing chemicals need
to be diluted before use, and the concentration of the
solution should be the lowest when used for treatment of
very small diameter veins, such as telangiectasia. Recommended concentrations of STS and polidocanol are listed in
Table VIII.
Liquid sclerotherapy is performed using small tuberculin syringes and a 30- or 32-gauge needle. Treatment is
usually started with larger varicose veins and ends with
reticular veins and telangiectasia. The proximal part of the
limb is treated first and the distal part second. Using loupes
for magnification and transillumination (Veinlite, TransLite, Sugar Land, Tex; VeinViewer, Luminetx, Memphis,
Tenn) helps intraluminal injection and avoids extravasation
of the drug. The injection maximum of 1.0 mL of the
chemical to one site is recommended, with not more than
10 to 20 injections performed per session. Severe pain
during injection may signal extravasation, and further injection should be avoided.29 Gauze pads are placed on the
injection sites, and the patient is instructed to wear 30 to 40
mm Hg graduated compression stockings for 1 to 3 days
after treatment of telangiectasia and reticular veins and at
least 1 week after treatment of varicose and perforating
veins.
Foam sclerotherapy. Foam sclerotherapy of the saphenous vein is the least invasive of the endovenous ablation techniques. The European Consensus Meetings on
Foam Sclerotherapy308,309 reported that foam was an effective, safe, and minimally invasive endovenous treatment
for varicose veins with a low rate of complications.
The most popular technique used today was developed
by Tessari et al312 using a three-way stopcock connected
with two syringes. Experts recommend a ratio of 1 part
solution of STS or polidocanol to 4 or 5 parts of air.313
Mixing the drug with air using the two syringes and push-

ing the mixture from one syringe into the other 20 times
results in an approximate bubble size of ⬍100 ␮m.
Coleridge-Smith306 advises to cannulate the veins in
supine patients and then elevate the limb 30° to inject the
foam. Ultrasonography is used to monitor the movement
of foam in the veins. The saphenous trunk is injected first,
followed by varicose and perforating veins if indicated. A
maximum of 20 mL of foam is injected during one session.
Bergan313 recommends elevation of the limb for 10 to 15
minutes after injection to minimize the volume of foam
that gets into the systemic circulation. The procedure is
completed by placing a short stretch bandage or 30 to 40
mm Hg graduated compression stockings (or both) on
the limb. Although most authors recommend 1 to 2
weeks of compression,313,314 a recent RCT found no
advantage to compression bandaging for ⬎24 hours
when thromboembolus-deterrent stockings were worn
for the remainder of 14 days.315
Complications. Severe complications after sclerotherapy, such as death, anaphylactic reaction, pulmonary emboli, stroke, and large areas of skin necrosis, are very rare
(⬍0.01%).316 Severe but rare complications also include
thrombophlebitis, nerve damage (saphenous, sural), DVT,
or inadvertent arterial injection of the solution.317,318
Transient neurologic adverse effects such as visual disturbance, migraine-like headache, or confusional state may
occur and are more frequent in patients with a patent
foramen ovale.319
Most complications are minor, and include matting,
pigmentation, pain, allergy, and skin urticaria. The higher
the concentration of the agent, the higher the likelihood of
hyperpigmentation, a minor complication that can be observed in up to 30% of the cases.320 Between 70% and 95%
of the pigmentations, however, resolve by 1 year after
therapy.317
The incidence of major neurologic events after foam
injection is rare; instances of stroke were reported by Bush
et al321 and others.319,322,323 Immediate treatment with
100% oxygen and possibly hyperbaric oxygen therapy
should be considered. Factors implicated in the risk of stroke
after foam sclerotherapy include the use of air instead of
carbon dioxide to prepare the foam, large bubble size, a patent
foramen ovale, failure to elevate the limb after treatment,
prolonged immobility after therapy, and an excessive amount
of foam used during one session.319,322-324 Standardization
of the bubble size using commercially prepared microfoam and the replacement of air with carbon dioxide in
the solution may decrease the risk of neurologic
complications.325
A recent study Regan et al326 proposed that the composition and properties of the foam, including bubble size
and gaseous components, may indeed contribute to the
potential for microcirculatory obstruction and cerebral
ischemia. The authors tested an ultralow nitrogen polidocanol endovenous microfoam with controlled bubble size
and density and found that patients treated with foamed
liquid sclerosants are commonly exposed to cerebrovascular gas bubbles. In a series of 60 high-risk patients with

34S Gloviczki et al

middle cerebral artery bubble emboli during or after treatment, however, there was no evidence of cerebral or cardiac
microinfarction.
Although rare, allergic reactions and anaphylaxis after injection of a sclerosing solution can occur, and it is
essential to have an emergency protocol, resuscitation
equipment, oxygen, and drugs (diphenhydramine, epinephrine, cimetidine, steroids) available to prevent a
major catastrophe.
Guex et al296 reported early and midterm complications in a prospective multicenter registry that included
12,173 sclerotherapy sessions, consisting of 5434 with
liquid, 6395 with foam, and 344 using both. Ultrasonographic guidance was used in 4088 sessions (33.9%), and
49 incidents or accidents (0.4%) occurred, of which 12
were with liquid and 37 with foam. There were 20 cases of
visual disturbances, in 19 cases, foam or air block was used;
all resolved shortly, without any after effects. A femoral vein
thrombosis was the only severe adverse event in this study,
which also demonstrated that sclerotherapy is a safe
technique.
A systematic review of foam sclerotherapy also found a
low rate of major complications.10 In ⬎9000 patients
studied, the median rates of serious adverse events, including PE and DVT, were rare, ⬍1%. The median rate of visual
disturbance was 1.4%, headache occurred in 4.2%, thrombophlebitis in 4.7%, matting, skin staining, or pigmentation
in 17.8%, and pain at the site of injection in 25.6%.
Morrison et al327 evaluated the safety of carbon dioxide
in patients undergoing 1% polidocanol foam sclerotherapy
and compared them with a historical control of patients
who had air mixed with the sclerosing agent. The carbon
dioxide– based foam group had 128 patients (115 women
and 13 men). Visual disturbances were experienced by 3.1%
(4 of 128) of the carbon dioxide group and in 8.2% (4 of
49) of the air group (P ⫽ .15). The incidence of chest
tightness (3.1% vs 18%), dry cough (1.6% vs 16%), and
dizziness (3.1% vs 12%) was significantly lower in the
carbon dioxide group compared with the air group (P ⬍
.02). Nausea occurred in 2% of the carbon dioxide foam
group and in 4% of the air foam group (P ⫽ .53). Overall,
the proportion of patients describing adverse effects decreased from 39% (19 to 49) to 11% (14 to 128) as carbon
dioxide replaced air for foam preparation (P ⬍ .001). The
authors concluded that adverse effects decreased significantly if carbon dioxide rather than air was used to make the
sclerosing foam for chemical ablation of superficial veins of
the lower extremity.
Results. Short-term and midterm results of liquid
sclerotherapy have been good for both reticular and varicose veins, but durable success depends largely on the
presence or absence of axial reflux. Those with untreated
incompetent saphenous veins have the highest rate of recurrence.295,328 Kern et al329 reported results of liquid
sclerotherapy of telangiectasia and reticular veins in 96
patients. Those who wore elastic stockings for 3 weeks after
treatment had an early success rate of 76%. Goldman330
published results of a prospective trial comparing the effi-

cacy of two liquid sclerosants, polidocanol and STS, and
both were used to treat varicose and telangiectatic veins. All
patients had an average of 70% improvement, and 70% to
72% were satisfied in all vein categories treated with either
solution.
Liquid sclerotherapy does poorly for treatment of the
incompetent GSV, but results of foam sclerotherapy are
much more encouraging. Rabe et al331 performed a multicenter RCT to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GSV
sclerotherapy using standardized polidocanol foam. The
3% foam was more efficient than and equally as safe as the
3% liquid for the treatment of the incompetent GSV.
In a prospective comparative study, Yamaki et al332
compared results of duplex-guided foam sclerotherapy and
duplex-guided liquid sclerotherapy in 77 patients. Duplex
scanning at 1 year demonstrated complete occlusion in the
GSV for duplex-guided foam sclerotherapy in 25 limbs
(67.6%), which was a significantly higher rate than that for
duplex-guided liquid sclerotherapy in 7 limbs (17.5%; P ⬍
.0001). Recurrent varicose veins were found in 3 patients
(8.1%) in the duplex-guided foam sclerotherapy group and
in 10 (25%) in the duplex-guided liquid sclerotherapy
group at 1 year (P ⫽ .048). Cabrera et al333 reported an
80% occlusion rate at 4 to 6 years when they used microfoam to treat incompetent GSV in 415 limbs.
In 808 patients with 1411 affected limbs, Coleridge
Smith306 used 1% polidocanol, 1% STS, and 3% STS in the
form of foam to treat incompetent saphenous trunks, and
459 limbs were available for duplex imaging at a follow-up
of ⱖ6 months. The GSV remained obliterated in 88% of
limbs and the SSV in 82%.
A Cochrane review on sclerotherapy published by Tisi
et al40 in 2006 concluded that evidence supports the current place of sclerotherapy in modern clinical practice,
which is usually limited to treatment of recurrent varicose
veins after surgery and thread veins.
The efficacy of foam sclerotherapy on QOL was recently demonstrated in a single-center cohort study by
Darvall et al.334 These author found that ultrasoundguided foam sclerotherapy for great and small saphenous
varicose veins leads to significant improvements in generic
and disease-specific health related QOL for at least 12
months after treatment.
Surgery vs sclerotherapy. A Cochrane review in 2004
examined results of surgery vs sclerotherapy for the treatment of varicose veins. Rigby et al335 reviewed 2306 references that included 61 comparative studies and 9 randomized trials. The study observed a trend that sclerotherapy
was better at 1 year and surgery had a better outcome at 3
to 5 years. The meta-analysis concluded, however, that
there was insufficient evidence to preferentially recommend
sclerotherapy for treatment of varicose veins over surgical
treatment.
Wright et al325 reported the effect of polidocanol microfoam and compared its use with surgery or sclerotherapy
in the management of varicose veins. This European RCT
found that 1% microfoam was inferior to surgery but supe-

rior to conventional sclerotherapy. Foam resulted in less
pain and earlier returns to work than surgery.
In a systematic review on foam sclerotherapy, Jia et al10
analyzed data of 69 studies, including 10 RCTs. All patients
underwent foam sclerotherapy for varicose veins, most
frequently with use of polidocanol to ablate the GSV or
SSV. The median rate of complete occlusion of treated
veins was 87%. Meta-analysis for complete occlusion suggested that foam sclerotherapy was less effective than surgery (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.67-1.10) but more effective
than liquid sclerotherapy (RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.91-2.11),
although there was substantial heterogeneity between studies. The authors concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to allow a meaningful comparison of the
effectiveness of this treatment with that of other minimally
invasive therapies or surgery.
Surgery vs endothermal ablations vs foam sclerotherapy. A systematic review and meta-analysis of RFA,
EVLA, and foam sclerotherapy for primary varicose veins
was reported by Luebke and Brunkwall9 in 2008. Results
were compared with those achieved with conventional ligation and vein stripping. This study included 29 EVLA
studies, 32 RFA studies, and 22 foam sclerotherapy trials.
RFA was inferior to EVLA and foam sclerotherapy in
saphenous occlusion rate, phlebitis, DVT, and paresthesias.
EVLA had the highest occlusion rate and least recurrence
compared with RFA and foam. Foam sclerotherapy of
varicose veins was associated with a higher recurrence rate
in patients with saphenofemoral incompetence compared
with the rates after EVLA or RFA. This study concluded
that EVLA, RFA, and foam sclerotherapy seem to be safe
and effective, with good short-term and midterm results,
but large, high-quality, prospective RCTs comparing endovenous techniques and endovenous techniques with surgery are needed before considering endovenous techniques
as the standard treatment of varicose veins.
In a subsequent meta-analysis of EVLA results, van den
Bos et al248 compared RFA, foam sclerotherapy, and
HL/S. They analyzed results of 64 clinical trials that included treatment of 12,320 limbs with an average follow-up of 32.2 months. The estimated pooled success rate
at 3 years was highest after EVLA (94%), followed by RFA
(84%), HL/S (78%), and foam sclerotherapy (77%). EVLA

was significantly superior to other treatment modalities in
abolition of the saphenous reflux. Foam therapy and RFA
were equally effective as surgery. The meta-analysis concluded that endovenous thermal ablations or foam sclerotherapy is at least as effective as surgery for treatment of
varicose veins.
Another large meta-analysis of the SVS and AVF on
varicose vein treatment is reported by Murad et al12 in this
issue the Journal of Vascular Surgery. The authors examined data from 8207 patients reported in 38 comparative
studies that included 29 RCTs. Each study included two or
more treatments, such as surgery, laser ablation, RFA, and
liquid or foam sclerotherapy. The meta-analysis found that
surgery was associated only with a nonsignificant reduction
in varicose vein recurrence, compared with sclerotherapy,
laser therapy, or RFA. Studies of laser therapy, RFA, and
foam sclerotherapy, however, demonstrated short-term effectiveness and safety. The authors concluded that lowquality evidence supports long-term safety and efficacy of
surgery for the treatment of varicose veins and that shortterm studies support the efficacy of less invasive treatments,
which are associated with less early disability and pain.
Results of these meta-analyses and data of several RCTs
and single-treatment cohort studies as well as a recent review336 and an editorial337 now question the continuing role
of open surgery with HL/S as the gold standard for treatment
of varicose veins. On the basis of the available data, the Joint
Committee of the SVS/AVF agreed that because of the
minimally invasive nature and similar or better early-term and
equivalent midterm results, endovenous thermal ablations
should be recommended over open surgery as the first line of
treatment of varicose veins associated with axial reflux. The
Committee also recognized that results of foam therapy have
improved but that they are not yet equivalent to those obtained after endovascular or open venous surgery. The Committee recommended that there was an urgent need for wellperformed, large RCTs comparing adverse effects and longterm saphenous occlusion rates of surgery, endovenous
thermal ablations, and foam sclerotherapy. These studies
should include detailed analyses of safety and costs and should
also evaluate the QOL of patients who undergo treatment
using any of these procedures.

SPECIAL VENOUS PROBLEMS
Perforating veins
An association between incompetent perforating veins
and venous ulcers was established more than a century ago
by Gay,338 and surgical perforator interruption was recommended to treat venous ulcers by Homans,339 Linton,340
Cockett et al,341,342 and Dodd.343 Hauer344 introduced
SEPS in 1985, O’Donnell345 was the first to use laparoscopic instrumentation, while the Mayo Clinic team346 and
Conrad347 improved the technique and added carbon dioxide insufflation to the procedure. Between 1992 and
2008, SEPS became the technique of choice for perforator
ablation, primarily because of the reduced rate of wound
complications.62,348-350
However, the emergence of ultrasonographically guided
thermal ablations and sclerotherapy in recent years has transformed the techniques of perforator ablation.351-356 Advantages of percutaneous ablation of perforators (PAPS) include the low risk of a minimally invasive procedure that is
easily repeatable and can be performed under local anesthesia in an office setting.357
Techniques of perforator ablation
Subfascial endoscopic perforator vein surgery. SEPS is
performed under general or epidural anesthesia. The single
or the double endoscopic port techniques can be used for
dissection and division of medial calf perforators.62,348-350
Most authors use balloon dissection and carbon dioxide
insufflation with a pressure of 30 mm Hg and a pneumatic
thigh tourniquet inflated to 300 mm Hg to avoid any
bleeding in the surgical field.358 Division of the fascia of the
deep posterior compartment with a paratibial fasciotomy is
required to identify all important medial perforating veins.
Occlusion of the perforators can be done with endoscopic
clips, although most surgeons use an ultrasonic harmonic
scalpel for division and transection of the perforators. The
wounds are closed, the tourniquet is deflated, and the
extremity is wrapped with an elastic bandage. The operation is an outpatient procedure, and patients are encouraged to ambulate 3 hours after the operation.
Percutaneous ablation of perforators. PAPS is performed under ultrasound guidance, with direct needle
puncture of the perforating vein. Local anesthesia is used,
with the patient in the reversed Trendelenburg position to
allow for full venous distention. The tip of the needle
should be at or just below the fascia in the vein to minimize
deep vessel and nerve injury.
Radiofrequency ablation. The ClosureRFS Stylet is a
new intravascular ablation device (VNUS Medical Technologies, San Jose, Calif) available for RFA of the perforating vein. Intraluminal placement of the RF stylet is confirmed by ultrasonography and also by measuring
impedance: values between 150 and 350 ohms indicate the
intravascular location of the tip of the probe. Local anesthesia is used to infiltrate the tissues around the stylet before
treatment, and the patient is then placed in the Trendelenburg position. Treatment is performed with a target tem-

perature of 85°C. All four quadrants of the vein wall are
treated for 1 minute each. The catheter is then withdrawn 1
or 2 mm, and a second treatment is performed. The treatment is finished with applying compression to the region of
the treated perforating vein.
Endovenous laser ablation. For laser treatment of perforating veins, a 16-gauge angiocatheter (for a 600-␮m
laser fiber) or a 21-gauge micropuncture needle (for a
400-␮m laser fiber) can be used.357 Intraluminal placement
of the access catheter is confirmed by ultrasonography and
by aspiration of blood at or just below the fascial level. Once
the fiber is positioned in the vein at or just below the level
of the fascia, local anesthesia is infiltrated, and various
methods of energy application are used. Elias357 recommends a pulsed technique with the generator set for 15
watts and a 4-second pulse interval. Each segment of vein is
treated twice, thus giving 120 J to each segment. Three
segments are usually treated. Proebstle and Herdemann359
also treat the perforating veins at three locations, each
segment receiving between 60 and 100 J. The rest of the
procedure is similar to RFA.
Sclerotherapy. For chemical ablation of perforating
veins, a 25-, 27-, or 30-gauge needle can be used for
cannulation. If the anatomy allows, a wire may be placed
into the deep system for better control of the access.
Ultrasonographically guided sclerotherapy has been reported using morrhuate sodium,351 although most experts
recommend STS or polidocanol foam. Care should be
taken to avoid injection of the agent into the accompanying
artery. During injection of 0.5 to 1 mL of the sclerosant,
the patient’s leg is elevated to avoid flow into the deep
system. After treatment, compression is applied over the
treated perforators.357
Complications. SEPS is safe and complications are
rare. Death or PE has not been reported, and the North
American SEPS registry had no patient with DVT ⱕ30 days
of the procedure. Wound infection and saphenous neuralgia occurred in 6% each. In an RCT, Pierik et al360 observed
a significantly higher rate of wound complications after
open perforator ligation, using a modified Linton procedure, than after endoscopic perforator ligation (53% vs 0%;
P ⬍ .001).
Complications after PAPS are rare, and in a review of
published series, O’Donnell356 found evidence of tibial
vein DVT in three series and foot drop and skin burn in one
each. Masuda et al351 treated 80 limbs with sclerotherapy of
the perforating veins. There were no cases of DVT involving the deep vein adjacent to the perforator injected. One
patient had skin complications with skin necrosis.
Results of perforator ablation
Subfascial endoscopic perforator vein surgery. Most
series of SEPS were performed in patients with advanced
disease (class C3-C6, mostly C5 and C6), and perforator
interruption was performed with ablation of the incompetent superficial system. Therefore, benefit directly attributable to perforator interruption is not well known.

Simple varicose veins (CEAP class C2). In an RCT,
Kianifard et al361 analyzed the benefits of adding SEPS to
saphenofemoral ligation and stripping of the GSV in patients
with class C2 disease. The study allocated 38 to the SEPS
group and 34 to the no-SEPS group. The two groups were
similar with respect to pain, mobility, varicose vein recurrence,
and QOL scores during the 1-year follow-up. A significantly
higher proportion of patients in the no-SEPS group had
incompetent perforating veins on duplex imaging at 1 year
(25 of 32 vs 12 of 38; P ⬍ .001). This RCT concluded that at
1 year in class C2 patients, no additional clinical benefit could
be observed when SEPS was added to HL/S.
This finding was supported by a prospective study by
van Neer et al362 in 62 limbs with class C2 disease, who had
varicose veins distal to the knee and underwent HL/S of
the GSV to the level of the knee. Clinical and ultrasonographic residual varicose veins at 6 months were not significantly related to the presence of preoperative incompetent
perforating veins.
Chronic venous insufficiency (CEAP class C3-C6). The
North American SEPS registry reported the results of SEPS
performed in 17 U.S. centers on 155 limbs, 85% with class
C5 and C6 disease. Ulcer healing at 1 year was 88%, with the
median time to ulcer healing of 54 days.62,350 Ulcer recurrence was 16% at 1 year and 28% at 2 years. This registry
contained data on 27 patients with class C6 disease who
underwent SEPS alone. The ulcer recurrence rate (35%) in
the SEPS-only group at 2 years was not significantly higher
than recurrence in patients who underwent SEPS and superficial ablation alone (25%).
Nelzen363 prospectively collected data from 149 SEPS
procedures in 138 patients, of whom 89% underwent saphenous surgery as well. During a median follow-up of 32
months, 32 of 36 ulcers healed, more than half (19 of 36)
ⱕ1 month. Three ulcers recurred, one of which subsequently healed during follow-up. In a subsequent series
from the same group, 97 limbs with class C5 and C6 disease
were treated with SEPS. Superficial ablation was also performed in 87%. All patients were monitored for at least 5
years. Ulcers healed in 87%, and the 3- and 5-year recurrence rates were 8% and 18%. Long-term data in 51 limbs
with class C5 and C6 disease were published by Iafrati et
al,364 who performed SEPS alone in 23 limbs and SEPS
with stripping in 28. The ulcers healed rapidly, and the
5-year ulcer recurrence rate was low (13%).
Post-thrombotic patients do worse than those with
primary incompetence. In the Mayo Clinic series, 5-year
ulcer recurrence was 56% in post-thrombotic patients vs
15% in patients with primary valvular incompetence (P ⬍
.05).365,366 Post-thrombotic patients with significant deep
venous disease still gained some benefit, as measured by
improved VCSS as well as an apparent ease in treating the
smaller and more superficial ulcers compared with their
preoperative state.
A single-center cohort study by Bianchi et al367 observed ulcer healing in 91% (53 of 58) of limbs with C6
disease at a mean of 2.9 months (range, 13 days-17
months) after SEPS and saphenous stripping. Ulcer recur-

Gloviczki et al 37S

rence at 30 months was 6%. Ulcer recurrence at 4 years
was as high as 31% in the ESCHAR study when compression treatment was combined with surgical ablation of
the superficial reflux, but no perforator interruption was
performed.157
In a large, retrospective, multicenter cohort study,
Tawes et al368 monitored 832 patients with CEAP clinical
class C4 to C6 for 9 years after SEPS. Only 55% of the
patients underwent HL/S in addition to SEPS. In this
study, 92% of ulcers healed with only 4% recurrences. There
was a 3% nonfatal complication rate, and significant improvement was documented in venous hemodynamics in a
subset of patients.
In a systematic review, Tenbrook et al38 reported results of the SEPS procedure performed with or without
superficial ablation on 1140 limbs in 1 RCT and 19 case
series. Ulcers in 88% of limbs healed and recurred in 13%, at
a mean time of 21 months. Risk factors for nonhealing and
recurrence included postoperative incompetent perforating
veins, pathophysiologic obstruction, previous DVT, and
ulcer diameter ⬎2 cm. The authors concluded that surgical
treatment, including SEPS, with or without saphenous
ablation, is recommended for patients with venous ulcers,
but RCTs are needed to discern the contributions of compression therapy, superficial venous surgery, and SEPS in
patients with advanced CVI.
The Dutch SEPS RCT59 compared results of surgical
treatment in 103 patients (SEPS, with or without superficial reflux ablation) with medical treatment in 97 patients
with venous ulcers. The rate of ulcer healing at 29 months
in the surgical group was 83%, with recurrence of 22%. In
the conservative treatment group, ulcers healed in 73% and
recurred in 23% (P ⫽ NS). The study concluded that SEPS,
with or without superficial ablation, failed to improve healing or recurrence over best medical treatment. Ulcer size
and duration were independent factors adversely affecting
ulcer healing and recurrence. In a subgroup analysis, medial
ulcers, recurrent ulcers, or SEPS done in centers of excellence did show significant benefit. In this study, 86% of the
patients had medial or recurrent ulcers. On the basis of
these data and results of a previous RCT by Stacey et al,369
the evidence summary of O’Donnell19 concluded that further properly conducted RCTs are needed to provide highquality evidence of efficacy of perforator interruptions in
patients with leg ulcers. Previous AVF recommendations
agreed with this statement.370
A recent meta-analysis of SEPS by Luebke and Brunkwall32 reviewed data of studies published between 1985
and 2008 and concluded that SEPS, used as part of a
treatment regimen for severe CVI, benefits most patients in
the short-term regarding ulcer healing and the prevention
of ulcer recurrence. SEPS is safe and has less early postoperative complications compared with the classic Linton
procedure. Luebke and Brunkwall also concluded that further prospective RCTs are needed to define the long-term
benefits of SEPS.
Hemodynamic improvement after SEPS with superficial ablation was confirmed by Padberg et al,127 who per-

We recommend against selective treatment of incompetent perforating veins in
patients with simple varicose veins (CEAP class C2).
We suggest treatment of “pathologic” perforating veins that includes those
with outward flow of ⱖ500-ms duration, with a diameter of ⱖ3.5 mm,
located beneath healed or open venous ulcer (class C5-C6).
For treatment of “pathologic” perforating veins, we suggest subfascial
endoscopic perforating vein surgery, ultrasonographically guided
sclerotherapy, or thermal ablations.

formed superficial and perforator ablations in 11 limbs and
used air plethysmography, foot volumetry, and duplex
scanning to assess results. At a median follow-up of 66
months, expulsion fraction and half-refilling time had both
improved significantly in patients, with no ulcer recurrence.
Rhodes et al,95 from Mayo Clinic, used strain-gauge plethysmography to quantitate calf muscle pump function and
venous incompetence before and after SEPS. Significant
improvement was noted in both calf muscle pump function
and venous incompetence in 31 limbs studied ⱕ6 months
after SEPS. Saphenous stripping was done in addition to
SEPS in 24 of the 31 limbs. Although the seven limbs
undergoing SEPS alone had significant clinical benefits, the
hemodynamic improvements were not statistically significant. It is important to note also that Akesson et al371 failed
to show additional benefit in ambulatory venous pressure,
when perforator interruption was performed after saphenous vein ablation.
Percutaneous ablation of perforators. PAPS is a new
technique, and most publications had a small number of
patients with short follow-up, who were treated frequently
for mild disease (CEAP class C2-C3).357 Most data provided are on safety and surrogate end points such as perforating vein occlusions but less so on clinical and functional
end points. A systematic review of five recently published
cohort studies and seven unpublished case series by
O’Donnell356 found a mean occlusion rate of 80% and a
mean follow-up of ⬍2 months.
Ultrasonographically guided sclerotherapy is gaining
rapid acceptance because perforating veins can be accessed
easily with a small needle without much pain to the patient.
Masuda et al351 reported clinical results with ultrasonographically guided sclerotherapy using morrhuate sodium
in 80 limbs with predominantly perforator incompetence
alone. The authors noticed a significant improvement in
VCSS, and ulcers rapidly healed in 86.5%, with a mean time
to heal of 36 days. The ulcer recurrence rate was 32% at a
mean of 20 months despite low compliance (15%) with
compression hose. New and recurrent perforators were
identified in 33% of limbs, and ulcer recurrence was statis-

tically associated with perforator recurrence as well as presence of postthrombotic syndrome.
Conclusions. Current data do not support adding
perforator ablation to ablation of the superficial system in
patients with simple varicose veins,361,362 and the Committee recommends against treatment of perforators in patients with CEAP class C2 disease (GRADE 1B). In patients
with advanced CVI, current data provide moderate evidence that large (ⱖ3.5 mm), high-volume, incompetent
“pathologic” perforators (reflux ⱖ500 ms), located in the
affected area of the limb with outward flow on duplex
scanning in patients with class C5 or C6 disease, can be
treated by experienced interventionists, unless the deep
veins are obstructed (GRADE 2B).22,56,87 Clinical data on
the efficacy of perforator ablations were obtained primarily
by using the SEPS procedure, but ultrasonographically
guided sclerotherapy or thermal ablations, when performed
with similar low complication rates, can be suggested as
alternative therapy for perforator treatment (GRADE 2C).
Pelvic varicosity and pelvic congestion syndrome
Valvular incompetence and retrograde flow to the ovarian veins and/or the internal iliac vein and its tributaries
may give rise to pelvic congestion syndrome and pelvic
varicosities, which may occur alone or together. Pelvic
congestion syndrome is associated with symptoms of pelvic
pain or heaviness, dyspareunia, and dysuria. Varicose veins
in the vulvar and perivulvar area are most often secondary to
previous pregnancy and are often associated with perimenstrual symptoms.
Evaluation. The appearance of varices in the region of
the pubis, labia, perineum, or buttocks suggests a pelvic
source of reflux. Several noninvasive diagnostic tests are
available, including lower extremity, transabdominal, and
transvaginal ultrasonography as well as CT and MR venography.372 All have been reported to be useful in documenting pelvic venous reflux, although the selection of the most
appropriate test largely depends on local institutional expertise. An ovarian vein diameter of ⬎6 mm on ultrasonography has been reported to have a 96% positive-predictive

We recommend noninvasive imaging with transabdominal and/or transvaginal
ultrasonography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance venography
in selected patients with symptoms of pelvic congestion syndrome or
symptomatic varices in the distribution of the pubis, labia, perineum, or
buttocks.
We recommend retrograde ovarian and internal iliac venography in patients
with pelvic venous disease, confirmed or suspected by noninvasive imaging
studies, in whom intervention is planned.
We suggest treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome and pelvic varices with
coil embolization, plugs, or transcatheter sclerotherapy, used alone or
together.
If less invasive treatment is not available or has failed, we suggest surgical
ligation and excision of ovarian veins to treat reflux.

value for pelvic varices.373 MR and CT venography criteria
for pelvic venous varices include four or more tortuous
parauterine veins, parauterine veins ⬎4 mm in diameter,
and an ovarian vein diameter ⬎8 mm.374
Retrograde ovarian and internal iliac venography is the
test of choice for the diagnosis of pelvic venous disorders,
although it is most often reserved for patients in whom
intervention is planned. Venographic criteria for pelvic
congestion syndrome include one or more of the following:
(1) an ovarian vein diameter of ⱖ6 mm, (2) contrast
retention for ⱖ20 seconds, (3) congestion of the pelvic
venous plexus and/or opacification of the ipsilateral (or
contralateral) internal iliac vein, or (4) filling of vulvovaginal and thigh varicosities.375
Treatment. Various nonsurgical and surgical approaches are available to treat pelvic congestion syndrome.
Pharmacologic agents to suppress ovarian function, such as
medroxyprogesterone or gonadotropin-releasing hormone, may offer short-term pain relief, but their long-term
effectiveness has not been proven. Surgical approaches,
including hysterectomy with unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy and ovarian vein ligation and excision, with interruption of as many collateral veins as possible, have been
suggested for patients unresponsive to medical therapy.373
Percutaneous transcatheter embolization of refluxing
ovarian and internal iliac vein tributaries with coils, plugs,
or sclerotherapy, usually as combination treatment, has
become the standard approach for management of both
pelvic congestion syndrome and varices arising from a
pelvic source.
Results. Transcatheter therapy has been reported to
improve symptoms in 50% to 80% of patients. Chung and
Huh374 randomized 106 premenopausal women with
chronic pelvic pain unresponsive to medical treatment to
one of three treatment regimens: (1) ovarian vein embolization, (2) laparoscopic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-

oophorectomy, and hormone replacement, or (3) laparoscopic hysterectomy and unilateral oophorectomy. Mean
pain scores as assessed on a 10-point visual analog scale
were significantly improved among those undergoing ovarian vein embolization or bilateral oophorectomy, but not
among those undergoing unilateral oophorectomy. Pain
reduction at 12 months was greatest in those undergoing
embolotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS
The revolution in endovascular technology has transformed the evaluation and treatment of venous disease
during the past decade. To keep up with the rapidly changing technology, in this document the Venous Guideline
Committee of the SVS and the AVF provides evidencebased guidelines for the management of varicose veins and
associated CVDs in 2011. These guidelines are essential to
the clinical practice using evidence-based medicine and play
a major role— but not the only role—in determining the
best care for patients with varicose veins and more advanced
forms of CVD. The scientific evidence presented in this
document must be combined with the physician’s clinical
experience and the patient’s preference to select the best
diagnostic tests and the best treatment option for each
individual patient.
