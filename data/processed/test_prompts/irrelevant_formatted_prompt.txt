High risk for transfemoral CAS. Lesion morphology
has a signiﬁcant impact on outcomes for patients undergoing transfemoral CAS. Very tight stenosis, irregular
calciﬁed stenosis, and long lesions can limit the ability
to deliver the stent across the lesion.172,175 Carotid
bifurcation stent placement in heavily or circumferentially calciﬁed lesions has been associated with a
signiﬁcant risk of stent fracture and deformation.181
Fresh thrombus within the carotid bifurcation is a
contraindication to carotid stent placement with distal
embolic protection devices (EPDs) because of risk of
embolization while crossing the lesion as well
thrombus disruption and embolization after stent
placement. Similarly, long, complex lesions can increase risk of embolization during placement of the
distal EPD and should, therefore, be approached
cautiously when considering transfemoral CAS.175 It is
unclear how the presence of a carotid string sign impacts patient outcomes after transfemoral CAS.
High risk for TCAR. Similar to transfemoral CAS,
circumferential or large bulky carotid bifurcation plaques can limit the ability to deliver the stent across
the lesion. Carotid bifurcation stent placement in
heavily or circumferentially calciﬁed lesions has been
associated with signiﬁcant risk of stent fracture and
deformation. As a result, heavily calciﬁed carotid bifurcation lesions are a relative contraindication to stent
placement. Early data suggest that long, complex,
and echolucent lesions may be treated safely with
TCAR because of proximal ﬂow reversal before crossing
the stenosis. However, the level of evidence to support
this observation is much lower than that for CEA and
transfemoral CAS.

Rationale. The presence of PAD constitutes a substantially increased risk of failure to heal and major lower

limb amputation for people with a diabetes related
foot ulcer or gangrene. Bedside testing results are an integral component of determining the severity of
ischaemia and, to that end, to determine the need for,
and urgency of, further investigations. Non-invasive
bedside tests including AP, ABI, and TP should be performed in a person with a DFU or gangrene to guide
further management as they can help to predict the
chance of healing and or major amputation. TcPO2 and
skin perfusion pressure (SPP) give additional information
on healing potential and are useful for measuring
perfusion following forefoot amputations when TP are no
longer possible. However, in the authors’ opinion these
are secondary tests due to greater expense and less
availability of the equipment and the time and expertise
required to apply them.
Assessment of the pedal arterial Doppler waveforms
combined with measurement of the AP and subsequent
calculation of the ABI, are usually the ﬁrst steps in the
assessment of PAD. Although relevant for its diagnosis,
as discussed in the Rationales of Recommendations 1
and 2, it was not possible to identify sufﬁcient data on
the capacity for Doppler arterial waveform analysis to
predict wound healing in populations with DFU.5 Two
low quality studies were identiﬁed which concluded
that abnormal or absent Doppler waveforms were associated with a small (15%) increase in the likelihood of major amputation,65,66 further limiting its use. Similarly,
there are currently insufﬁcient data to support the use
of TBI to predict healing or amputation outcomes; however, TP (as a component of TBI) has been more widely
investigated and is therefore included in the
recommendation.
The predictive capacity of APs and ABI for wound healing was inconsistent in the 15 studies included in the systematic review.5 Thresholds for AP and ABI which were
associated with increased probability of healing could
not be identiﬁed; however, a very low ankle pressure

those with diabetes and renal failure tend to develop infrapopliteal disease. The tibial
artery is the only infrapopliteal vessel listed as an answer option. All other options are
suprapopliteal.
6. A 75-year-old male with a history of migraines, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,
triple coronary bypass (CABG x3), recurrent cellulitis, glaucoma and benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH) presents to your clinic due to pain. He has smoked approximately
2 packs per day for over 30 years. Despite smoking cessation counseling, he continues
to smoke 1-2 cigarettes a day. He reports pain with walking for the past several years.
After walking one city block, his calves begin to hurt. He intermittently develops toe
sores and wounds that can take 1-2 months to heal. If the wound is larger, it can take
3-4 months to heal. What risk factors does this patient have that contribute to the most
likely disease process?
A. Migraines
B. BPH
C. Glaucoma

D. Smoking
E. Cellulitis
Answer
D. Smoking.
Discussion: Smoking contributes to worsening peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Peripheral arterial disease results when the arteries narrow due to plaque accumulation which
prevents or decreases the amount of oxygen-rich blood reaching your legs. The chemicals in tobacco products increase the rate of plaque formation in arterial walls thereby
narrowing the arterial lumen. Smoking also constricts blood vessels and causes blood to
clot, ultimately putting PAD patients at a higher risk of further complications such as
heart attacks, limb amputations, and death. Cellulitis and other wound complications
can be an effect of peripheral arterial disease, but is not the cause of peripheral disease.
The other options of migraines, BPH, glaucoma have no known associations with PAD.

Overall, a reduction of w50% was observed. Lesser
compression strength, such as 20 to 30 mm Hg, is not as
effective.519 Multilayer compression is effective only for
symptoms and not for development of PTS.520 The duration of compression for efﬁcacy has not been rigorously
determined by prospective studies.521 However, per the
current American College of Chest Physicians 2012 guidelines, use of compression stockings immediately after

diagnosis of DVT and continued compression for at least
6 months to 2 years are supported.522 A large recent
RCT calls this into question, but for now, we believe the
harms for this therapy are low.523
Use of IPC may be helpful to relieve PTS symptoms,
but its role in preventing VLU is unknown.524,525 Use of
IPC should be based on individual assessments as little evidence exists. A small randomized crossover trial in patients
with PTS found that compared with placebo-level pressure,
IPC with a level of compression of 50 mm Hg was associated with a signiﬁcant improvement in symptoms.524 However, the hard end point of VLU prevention was not
assessed. Two other groups of patients who may beneﬁt
from IPC are those with severe difﬁculty in donning standard compression stockings and those who are immobile.526,527 Here, studies focusing on the physiology of
decreased venous pressure and reduced interstitial edema
suggest beneﬁt for the latter group.

As post-thrombotic syndrome is a common preceding event for venous leg ulcers, we recommend current
evidence-based therapies for acute DVT treatment.
[GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B] We suggest
use of low-molecular-weight heparin over vitamin K
antagonist therapy of 3-month duration to decrease
post-thrombotic syndrome. [
Question: A 56-year-old man with chronic rate-controlled atrial fibrillation stopped coumadin prior to a colonoscopy 1 week ago. He is otherwise healthy and takes no other medications. He presents with pain in his left calf after walking two miles in 90 degree temperatures. He is found to have both absent pulses and doppler signals in both his dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries in that leg. This is accompanied by pallor and pain. What is the most likely etiology?
Choices:
A. Embolus as a result of his atrial fibrillation.
