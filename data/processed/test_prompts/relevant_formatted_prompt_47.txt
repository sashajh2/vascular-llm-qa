SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

21S
23S
24S
24S

Renal artery aneurysm (RAA). 1.1: In patients who are
thought to have RAAs, we recommend computed
tomography angiography (CTA) as the diagnostic tool
of choice. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
1.2: In patients who are thought to have RAA and have
increased radiation exposure risks or renal insufﬁciency,
we recommend non-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to establish the diagnosis.
Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of
Evidence: C (Low).

members of the Writing Committee were not allowed
to serve as an ofﬁcer, board member, trustee, owner, or
employee of a company directly or indirectly involved
in the topic of this guideline. Before the ﬁrst and last
meeting of the Writing Committee, members were
asked to report any COI in writing. In addition, at the
beginning of each meeting this question was also asked
and if answered yes, the members were asked to submit
an updated COI form. These COIs included income
received from biomedical companies, device manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, or other companies
producing products related to the ﬁeld. In addition, industry relationships had to be disclosed each time and
these included: ownerships of stocks or options or bonds
of a company, any consultancy, scientiﬁc advisory committee membership, or lecturer for a company, research
grants, or income from patents. These incomes could
either be personal or obtained by an institution with
which the member had a relationship. All disclosures
were reviewed by the three organisations, and these
can be found at IWGDFguidelines.org/. No company
was involved in the development or review of the guideline. Nobody else involved in the guideline received any
payment or remuneration of any costs.

DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY AS USED IN
THIS DOCUMENT
The deﬁnitions and criteria for diabetes related foot disease were standardised by the IWGDF and in parallel to
this guideline an update is published.24 In addition, in
this guideline the following terminology was used:
Bedside testing: any non-invasive test assessing for PAD
in the lower limb using a measure of blood ﬂow that
could be conducted at the bedside.

Chronic limb threatening ischaemia: a clinical syndrome
deﬁned by the presence of peripheral artery disease in combination with rest pain, gangrene, or foot ulcer of at least
two
weeks’
duration.
Venous,
embolic,
nonatherosclerotic, and traumatic aetiologies are excluded.
Diabetes related micro-angiopathy: pathological structural and functional changes in the microcirculation of
people with diabetes mellitus, which can occur in any
part of the body as a consequence of the disease.
Diabetes related foot ulcer: a break of the skin of the foot
that involves, as a minimum, the epidermis
Document 3:  However, the
Writing Committee considered there is likely to be
important variability in patient values due to the lack of
clear beneﬁt of one approach over the other.
Factors such as the severity of ischaemia and tissue loss
(e.g., WIfI staging) and patient suitability for the procedure and presence of comorbidities, as well as the availability of expertise and costs of the procedures (which
may vary between locations and countries) drives decision making in relation to the type of procedure considered appropriate with these factors also impacting.
Several studies have noted that only a minority of foot
and ankle wounds in their series corresponded to one
angiosome. Kret et al.125 found that only 36% of wounds
in their series corresponded to a single distinct angiosome. Similarly, Aerden et al.126 found it difﬁcult to allocate people to direct revascularisation versus indirect
revascularisation due to the presence of multiple
wounds and large wounds that had more than one
angiosome supplying them. In such cases it is the
opinion of the Writing Committee that the best quality
artery should preferentially be targeted. Many clinicians

will consider attempting to treat the second vessel supplying the wound as well, although there is a lack of evidence to support this approach.7
Clinical question
In people with DFU, do revascularisation perfusion outcomes predict healing, major amputation, or the need
for further revascularisation?

Recommendation 21
In a person with diabetes and either a foot ulcer or gangrene
who has undergone revascularisation, objectively assess adequacy of perfusion e.g., using non-invasive bedside testing.
Grade

Certainty of evidence

Best Practice Statement

Rationale
There are few available data examining the predictive
capacity of post-revascularisation perfusion measures
for healing or amputation outcomes or for the need for
further revascularisation in people with diabetes. However, adequate perfusion is essential for wound healing and

Recommendation 22
A person with diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and either a
foot ulcer or gangrene should be treated by a multidisciplinary team as part of a comprehensive care plan.

Question: Which of the following statements is true?
Choices:
A. Patients with unknown AAA history and symptoms should undergo further
diagnostic imaging if they are hemodynamically stable.
B. Symptomatic AAA should undergo emergency repair to prevent possible rupture.
C. Patients with an unknown AAA history must have diagnostic imaging confirmation of an AAA before proceeding to the operating theatre.
D. An ECG demonstrating ischemic changes in a patient with epigastric pain,
hypotension and tachycardia is the sine qua non for a myocardial infarction and
any operation should be postponed.
E. CT scans are reserved for elective evaluation of AAA and have no place in the
work-up of a symptomatic AAA.
Answer:
