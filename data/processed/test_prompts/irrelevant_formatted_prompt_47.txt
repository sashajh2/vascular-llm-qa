Document 1: 1; 95% CI, 0.69-2.46, P ¼ .41; eight studies; N ¼ 812).
Discussion (ﬁrst paragraph):
Twelve studies were included in this review, with a total of 1136 patients who underwent either a one-stage or
two-stage procedure. In terms of primary outcomes, the pooled evidence from the meta-analyses showed no
differences in primary ﬁstula failure rates, 1-year primary patency rates, 1-year secondary patency rates, 2-year
primary patency rates, and 2-year secondary patency rates.
Discussion (second to last paragraph):
Although there is a slight difference in the range of studies included in both reviews, the evidence from our review
agrees with prior conclusions.

CORRECTION
In the June 2019 regular and supplement issues of the Journal of Vascular Surgery, the editorials by Drs Lawrence
and Gloviczki that published in each issue contained an error in the use of the term “critical limb-threatening
ischemia”. The correct term is “chronic limb-threatening ischemia”. The error has been corrected in the title and
in the ﬁrst paragraph of both of these editorials.

CORRECTION
In the June 2019 supplement of the Journal of Vascular Surgery, the article by Conte et al (Conte MS, Bradbury AW,
Kolh P, White JV, Dick F, Fitridge R, et al. Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limbthreatening ischemia. J Vasc Surg 2019;69:3S-125S) contained a typo in the name of one of the co-authors. Dr Mauro
Gargiulo’s name incorrectly printed as “Mauro Garguilo.” The correct surname is Gargiulo.

Document 3: ous vein is translocated to the
forearm in a looped configuration between the antecubital
vein and brachial or proximal radial artery to perform the
two anastomoses.
Upper arm autogenous accesses. Upper arm accesses
have most commonly been based on the brachial artery for
inflow; however, the proximal radial artery is an excellent
choice for inflow as long as there is adequate length of vein
to support the additional 2 to 3 cm of length required to
perform the anastomosis at the proximal radial artery,
which is a few centimeters distal to the brachial artery at the
antecubital fossa. Although confusion may arise regarding
classification of accesses originating from the proximal radial artery, these accesses should be classified as upper arm
accesses except in cases where all access flow is retrograde
into the forearm.
Autogenous brachial (or proximal radial)– cephalic upper arm direct access. This autogenous access is performed
between the end of the cephalic vein and the brachial or
proximal radial artery located in the antecubital fossa. If the
cephalic vein and selected artery are close together, the
procedure is performed through one transverse incision; if
not, separate incisions are made and the end of the cephalic
vein is tunneled to the brachial or proximal radial artery to
perform the anastomosis.
Autogenous brachial (or proximal radial)– cephalic upper arm transposition. This autogenous access is performed
between the end of the cephalic vein and the brachial or
proximal radial artery. The cephalic vein is identified at the
elbow and mobilized to an appropriate length to allow its
free end to reach the brachial artery. The brachial artery is
identified through an extension of this incision or, if located
far away, through a second incision overlying the palpable
brachial artery pulse just beyond to the proximal radial artery.
The cephalic vein is tunneled superficially and medially towards the brachial artery to perform the anastomosis.
Autogenous brachial (or proximal radial)– basilic upper
arm transposition. This autogenous access is performed
between the

Question: Which of the following statements is true?
Choices:
A. Patients with unknown AAA history and symptoms should undergo further
diagnostic imaging if they are hemodynamically stable.
B. Symptomatic AAA should undergo emergency repair to prevent possible rupture.
C. Patients with an unknown AAA history must have diagnostic imaging confirmation of an AAA before proceeding to the operating theatre.
D. An ECG demonstrating ischemic changes in a patient with epigastric pain,
hypotension and tachycardia is the sine qua non for a myocardial infarction and
any operation should be postponed.
E. CT scans are reserved for elective evaluation of AAA and have no place in the
work-up of a symptomatic AAA.
