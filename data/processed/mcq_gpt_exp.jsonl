Platelet adhesion and aggregation contribute to the temporary hemostatic plug**\n \n * **Explanation:** When a blood vessel wall is injured, the underlying collagen is exposed. Platelets adhere to this collagen via von Willebrand factor (vWF). This adhesion triggers platelet activation, leading to the release of factors that attract more platelets and cause them to aggregate (stick together). This aggregation forms a temporary plug at the site of injury, reducing blood loss. This initial plug is fragile and needs to be reinforced.\n \n **B. Activation of coagulation by the intrinsic system contributes to the definitive hemostatic plug**\n \n * **Explanation:** The coagulation cascade is a series of enzymatic reactions that ultimately lead to the formation of fibrin, which stabilizes the platelet plug. The intrinsic pathway (also known as the contact activation pathway) is one of the two main pathways that initiate the coagulation cascade.

Cystic medial degeneration:** This is a weakening of the aortic wall caused by the breakdown of elastin and collagen in the tunica media (the middle layer of the aorta). This degeneration makes the aorta more susceptible to tearing and dissection. It's a well-established risk factor, often associated with conditions like Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\n \n * **C. Systemic hypertension:** Chronic high blood pressure puts significant stress on the aortic wall. This constant pressure can weaken the wall over time, making it more prone to tearing and dissection. Hypertension is one of the most common and important risk factors for aortic dissection.\n \n Here's why the other options are less directly causative:\n \n * **B. Syphilitic aortitis:** While syphilis *can* cause aortitis (inflammation of the aorta), it's a much less common cause of aortic dissection in the modern era due to the availability of antibiotics.

Platelet adhesion and aggregation contribute to the temporary hemostatic plug:** This is absolutely correct. When the blood vessel wall is damaged, the subendothelial collagen is exposed. Platelets adhere to this collagen via von Willebrand factor (vWF). This adhesion triggers platelet activation, leading to the release of factors that recruit more platelets and cause them to aggregate, forming a temporary plug.\n \n * **B. Activation of coagulation by the intrinsic system contributes to the definitive hemostatic plug:** This is also correct. Both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of the coagulation cascade are activated after vessel injury. The intrinsic pathway (also known as the contact activation pathway) is initiated when factor XII comes into contact with negatively charged surfaces exposed at the site of injury. This pathway, along with the extrinsic pathway, ultimately leads to the activation of factor X, which is crucial for the formation of thrombin and the subsequent fibrin clot.

Beam size:** A larger beam size means a larger volume of tissue is being irradiated. This leads to more interactions within the patient, and therefore, more scatter radiation is produced.\n \n * **C. Patient BMI:** A higher BMI indicates a larger patient size, meaning more tissue for the x-ray beam to interact with. More tissue interaction results in increased scatter radiation.\n \n * **B. Large distances between the x-ray source and the image intensifier:** While distance itself doesn't *create* scatter, it affects how much scatter reaches the image receptor. A larger air gap allows more of the scatter radiation to diverge and miss the image receptor, reducing its impact on image quality. However, it also means more scatter is present in the room, potentially affecting personnel.\n \n * **D.

In DIC, various underlying conditions (sepsis, trauma, malignancy, obstetric complications) can lead to the release of TF into the circulation. This TF triggers widespread activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to the formation of fibrin clots throughout the microvasculature.\n \n * **B. thrombocytopenia is common**\n \n  * **Explanation:** Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) is a hallmark of DIC. The widespread activation of the coagulation cascade consumes platelets as they are incorporated into the numerous microthrombi forming throughout the body. Additionally, platelet activation and aggregation can lead to their premature removal from circulation.\n \n * **D. plasma factor VIII levels fall**\n \n  * **Explanation:** DIC involves the consumption of coagulation factors, including factor VIII.

When LDL cholesterol becomes oxidized, it triggers a cascade of inflammatory and proliferative events. One of these events is the stimulation of endothelial cells to release growth factors. These growth factors (e.g., platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u00ce\u00b2)) promote the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells from the media to the intima of the artery wall. This contributes to the formation of the atherosclerotic plaque.\n \n * **D. oxidised LDL is toxic to smooth muscle cells**\n \n  * **Explanation:** While oxLDL can stimulate smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration (as mentioned above), it can also be directly toxic to these cells, especially at high concentrations.

For example, fluid-filled structures attenuate very little, while dense tissues like bone attenuate a lot. TGC is used to compensate for this varying attenuation, so you need to adjust it based on the tissue you're imaging to ensure structures at different depths appear with appropriate brightness.\n \n * **B. is reduced using transducers with greater frequency:** Higher frequency ultrasound waves are attenuated more rapidly than lower frequency waves. Therefore, when using a higher frequency transducer, you will need to apply more TGC to compensate for the increased attenuation. The statement is incorrect because it says TGC is reduced.\n \n * **C. requires adjustment when scanning obese patients:** Obese patients have a greater amount of tissue for the ultrasound beam to travel through.

Widespread vasodilation:** Septic shock is characterized by excessive vasodilation. This is primarily due to the release of inflammatory mediators (like nitric oxide, cytokines, and kinins) from immune cells and the endothelium in response to the infection. This vasodilation leads to a significant drop in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and, consequently, hypotension.\n \n * **C. Increased capillary permeability:** Inflammatory mediators also increase the permeability of the capillaries. This means that the normally tight junctions between endothelial cells lining the capillaries become leaky. As a result, fluid and proteins leak out of the bloodstream and into the interstitial space (the space between cells). This contributes to edema (swelling) and reduces the effective circulating blood volume, further exacerbating hypotension.\n \n * **D.

These bullae are prone to rupture.\n * **Decreased Breath Sounds on One Side:** This is a classic sign of a pneumothorax (collapsed lung), which can be caused by a ruptured bleb. The air escaping from the ruptured bleb enters the pleural space, causing the lung to collapse on that side.\n * **Tachypnea and Tachycardia:** The increased respiratory rate (24) and heart rate (102) are compensatory mechanisms to try and maintain oxygenation.\n * **Low Oxygen Saturation:** The 87% oxygen saturation at room air indicates significant respiratory compromise.\n \n **Why the other options are less likely:**\n \n * **A.

Which of the following is the best next step?", "choices": ["Cilostazol", "Propranolol", "Pentoxifylline", "Aspirin"], "correct_answer": ["A"], "explanation": "Here's why Cilostazol is the best next step in this scenario:\n \n * **Understanding the Problem:** The woman has peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and is experiencing intermittent claudication (cramp-like pain with walking). Despite a structured exercise program, her symptoms haven't improved. This indicates that further intervention is needed.\n \n * **Why Cilostazol is the Best Choice:**\n \n  * **Mechanism of Action:** Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor. It works by:\n  * **Vasodilation:** Dilating the arteries in the legs, improving blood flow.\n  * **Antiplatelet Effect:** Inhibiting platelet aggregation, which can reduce the risk of blood clots forming in the arteries.\n  * **Evidence-Based Benefit:** Cilostazol has been shown in numerous clinical trials to significantly improve walking distance and reduce claudication symptoms in patients with PAD. It is considered a first-line pharmacological treatment for intermittent claudication when exercise therapy alone is insufficient.\n \n * **Why the Other Options are Less Suitable:**\n \n  * **B.

Acute limb ischemia due to embolism (Correct):** This is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's presentation. Here's why:\n \n  * **Acute onset of severe pain:** Embolic events typically cause a sudden blockage of blood flow, leading to immediate and intense pain.\n  * **Atrial fibrillation:** This is a major risk factor for emboli. Atrial fibrillation causes irregular heartbeats, which can lead to blood clots forming in the heart (particularly the left atrium). These clots can then travel through the bloodstream and lodge in a peripheral artery, such as one in the leg.\n  * **\"6 Ps\" of Acute Limb Ischemia:** The patient exhibits several of the classic signs and symptoms of acute limb ischemia, often remembered by the mnemonic \"6 Ps\":\n  * **Pain:** Severe, acute pain.\n  * **Pallor:** Pale skin color.\n  * **Pulselessness:** Absent dorsalis pedis pulse.\n  * **Paresthesia:** Altered sensation.\n  * **Paralysis:** Inability to move the leg.", "source": "prep"}

Performing an ankle-brachial index (ABI) requires an appropriately sized manual blood pressure cuff and a hand-held, continuous-wave Doppler probe. The patient should be in the supine position and allowed to rest before the examination begins. The blood pressure cuff is placed above the ankle. The Doppler probe is used to locate the dorsalis pedis (DP) or posterior tibial (PT) pulse. The pressure cuff is inflated until the Doppler signal is obliterated, and then the cuff is then slowly released. The pressure at which the Doppler signal returns is the ankle pressure. The same process is repeated for both legs (DP and PT signals) and both arms. The arm pressure must be measured with the Doppler probe and the manual blood pressure cuff. To calculate an ABI, the higher ankle pressure (DP or PT) is divided by the highest arm pressure (left or right). Note that the higher arm pressure is used to calculate the ABI for both legs. For this specific case, the highest arm pressure is 150. To calculate on the right, 165/150=1.1, on the left 120/150=0.8. A normal ABI is 0.9 to 1.2.

An arterial embolism refers to an acute event where thrombogenic material lodges in an arterial tree, usually at a branching point. Various etiologies exist, including septic and cardiogenic sources. In a patient with atrial fibrillation, a laminated thrombus with a cardiac origin is likely the cause of his embolus. As previously mentioned, when an embolus occurs, it often becomes lodged at an arterial bifurcation, usually at a narrowed peripheral location where the arterial caliber changes. One of the more common locations for obstruction is the common femoral artery at the bifurcation of the superficial femoral artery and profunda femoris, which can lead to an acute arterial cutoff sign as seen in the computed tomography angiogram described in this case. Patients presenting with acute limb ischemia classically present with one or more of the six Ps: pulselessness, pallor, pain, paresthesia, paralysis, and poikilothermia. The man has several of these findings, making the diagnosis of an acute embolic event reasonable. The findings of buttock claudication, erectile dysfunction, and decreased femoral pulses are a classic presentation of Leriche syndrome, which is caused by chronic aortoiliac occlusive disease. Bilateral decreased foot sensation and pain is more likely seen in a patient with diabetic neuropathy and venous stasis. Reproducible calf pain that improves with rest and has decreased signals is consistent with chronic peripheral arterial disease and claudication.

Here's a breakdown:\n \n * **Higher Risk of Thrombosis and Embolization:** PAAs often present in an emergency setting due to acute thrombosis (clot formation within the aneurysm) or distal embolization (clots breaking off and traveling downstream, blocking smaller arteries). These events compromise blood flow to the limb.\n \n * **Increased Limb Ischemia:** The sudden loss of blood flow in an emergency situation leads to severe limb ischemia (lack of oxygen and nutrients). This can cause irreversible damage to muscles and nerves, increasing the risk of amputation.\n \n * **Technical Challenges:** Emergency repairs are often more technically challenging due to the presence of thrombus, inflammation, and edema in the surrounding tissues. This can make dissection and graft placement more difficult.\n \n * **Poorer Graft Patency:** Because of the above factors, grafts placed during emergency PAA repair have a higher risk of failure (occlusion or thrombosis) compared to grafts placed electively.\n \n * **Lower Limb Salvage Rates:** Ultimately, the combination of increased ischemia, technical challenges, and graft failure", "source": "case_studies"}

{"id": "450", "question": "What is the most frequent complication during thrombolytic therapy for peripheral arterial occlusion?", "choices": ["Pulmonary failure", "Myocardial infarction", "Intracranial hemorrhage", "Vascular access bleeding"], "correct_answer": ["D"], "explanation": "Here's why vascular access bleeding is the most frequent complication of thrombolytic therapy for peripheral arterial occlusion:\n \n * **Mechanism of Thrombolysis:** Thrombolytic drugs (like tPA, streptokinase, or urokinase) work by dissolving blood clots. They achieve this by activating plasminogen, which then converts to plasmin, an enzyme that breaks down fibrin, the main component of blood clots. This systemic activation of the fibrinolytic system means that the body's natural clotting mechanisms are impaired throughout the treatment period.\n \n * **Vascular Access Site:** Thrombolytic therapy for peripheral arterial occlusion typically involves inserting a catheter directly into the affected artery to deliver the drug locally. This insertion site, by its very nature, creates a potential bleeding point. Because the patient is receiving a medication that inhibits clotting, even minor trauma at the access site can lead to significant bleeding.\n \n * **Frequency:** While serious complications like intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and myocardial infarction (MI) are possible with thrombolytic therapy, they are less frequent than bleeding complications.

The most frequent cause of arterial embolism is atrial fibrillation in association with atherosclerotic heart disease.** This is correct. Atrial fibrillation (AFib) causes the atria to quiver instead of contracting effectively. This leads to blood stasis in the atria, increasing the risk of thrombus (blood clot) formation. These clots can then dislodge and travel through the arterial system, causing embolization. Atherosclerotic heart disease often coexists with AFib, further contributing to the risk by providing a surface for clot formation and increasing the likelihood of AFib itself.\n \n * **D. Deep venous thrombosis might represent a rare cause of arterial embolism.** This is correct, although less common. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) typically leads to pulmonary embolism (clots traveling to the lungs). However, in the presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or an atrial septal defect (ASD), a clot from the venous system can cross into the arterial circulation, causing a paradoxical embolism.

The mechanism of injury (blast) implies a high degree of energy transfer, causing extensive tissue damage, contamination, and vascular disruption. Blast injuries often result in more severe and complex injuries than blunt or penetrating trauma, making limb salvage more challenging.\n \n * **C. Time to Treatment:** Ischemia time (the duration of inadequate blood supply to the limb) is critical. The longer the limb is without adequate perfusion, the greater the risk of irreversible tissue damage, infection, and systemic complications (like rhabdomyolysis and renal failure). In this case, the patient has already been without perfusion to the left leg for some time, and the right foot is showing signs", "source": "case_studies"}

Complex vein repair may prevent long-term limb dysfunction.** This is true. Damaged veins can lead to chronic venous insufficiency, edema, pain, skin changes, and even ulceration. Repairing complex venous injuries can restore venous return and prevent or minimize these long-term complications.\n \n * **E. Intraluminal venous shunting is an acceptable intraoperative temporising measure.** This is also true.

{"id": "15.8", "question": "A 40-year-old male was admitted to the emergency room approximately 1.5 h\nafter sustaining a blast injury to both lower limbs. He had been resuscitated at\nhis local accident and emergency department prior to transfer. On arrival, his\npulse was 120 bpm and his blood pressure 80/40 mmHg.\nExamination revealed that the patient had sustained significant blast injuries\nto both lower limbs with no obvious torso injuries. The left leg had sustained\nneurovascular damage above and below the knee with concomitant bone and\nsoft tissue injury; there was no tissue perfusion below the knee. On the right side\nthere was a large wound in the thigh extending anteriorly to the knee joint with\nprofuse bleeding; bony fragments could be seen in the wound and the right foot\nwas pale with no palpable pulses and slight reduction in sensation.\n\nThe patient was resuscitated as per advanced trauma life support (ATLS) proto-\ncol. Supplementary oxygen was administered in addition to obtaining additional IV\naccess. Pressure dressings were applied to the open wounds and further assessment\nrevealed an injury to the patient\u2019s right hand; no other significant injuries were pres-\nent. The patient was transferred to the operating theatre.\n\nIn the operating theatre, under general anaesthesia, the patient was placed in the\nsupine position. The lower abdomen and both legs were prepared and draped widely\nand IV broad spectrum antibiotics were administered. Closer examination revealed\nthat the left leg had sustained extensive injuries. The foot and distal calf were cold,\npale and mottled. There was a compound injury to the left femur and tibia with\ncomplete disruption of the superficial femoral artery, superficial femoral vein and\nextensive injury to the sciatic nerve. It was decided that primary amputation of the\nleft limb was required. On examination of the right leg there was complete disrup-\ntion of the distal superficial/popliteal artery, a ragged laceration of the popliteal vein\nand significant bruising to branches of the sciatic nerve. There was a shrapnel injury\nto the right hand involving the thumb and middle finger.\n\nImmediate surgical steps were as follows: (a) a proximal thigh tourniquet was\nplaced on the left leg to arrest haemorrhage prior to formal amputation. The lacera-\ntion to the right lower leg was then extended distally to facilitate exposure of the\nneurovascular structures. Control of the superficial femoral and below-knee popli-\nteal artery was obtained and a careful distal embolectomy performed. A Javid shunt\nwas then placed between the right superficial femoral artery and right below-knee\npopliteal vessel. Significant bleeding from a large defect in the popliteal\nvein occurred following shunt insertion; this was repaired using a lateral suture. The\nlong saphenous vein was harvested from the left leg, prior to performing above-\nknee amputation. While the left above-knee amputation was being performed, the\northopaedic surgeons carefully assessed the right lower limb and placed a tempo-\nrary fixation device traversing the right knee joint. Having obtained bony stability, with an external fixator device, the temporary intraluminal shunt was\nremoved and a definitive bypass performed using reversed left long saphenous vein graft. Formal fasciotomy was performed of the right lower leg using a standard lat-\neral and medial approach; distal pulses were confirmed in the right foot. Further debridement of necrotic muscle was performed and the wound on the medial aspect\nwas partially closed; the anterolateral wounds were debrided and irrigated, as were\nthe fasciotomy sites, with sterile dressings being applied to both.\n\nIn the absence of obvious haemorrhage, when is it appropriate to reinspect the\nwounds in the postoperative period?", "choices": ["1\u20132 h", "4\u20136 h", "12\u201316 h", "24\u201348 h", "5+ days"], "correct_answer": ["D"], "explanation": "Here's why the answer is D (24-48 hours) and why the other options are less appropriate:\n \n * **D. 24-48 h (Correct Answer):** This is the most appropriate timeframe for the first formal wound inspection after a complex trauma surgery like this.

In this case, the patient has a clear history of PAD, initially in the left leg and now likely progressing.\n \n * **Leriche Syndrome:** The combination of claudication (buttock, thigh, and calf pain), erectile dysfunction, and diminished femoral pulses is highly suggestive of Leriche syndrome. Leriche syndrome is a specific form of PAD involving the aortoiliac arteries (the aorta and iliac arteries). Blockage in these arteries reduces blood flow to the lower extremities and the pelvic region, leading to both claudication and ED.\n \n * **Recurrence of Symptoms:** The patient's ED initially resolved after the angioplasty, which improved blood flow to the pelvic region.

The right leg\npulses were normal. Both feet appeared well perfused. No bruits were audible\nin the abdomen or groins. The abdominal aorta was not aneurismal. Ankle\npressure brachial indices were 0.74 on the left and 0.93 on the right at rest. On\ntreadmill walking for 100 m the left ankle pressure fell to 0.49.\n\nThe clinical findings were sufficient to make the diagnosis of peripheral arterial\ndisease (PAD).

Interwoven nitinol stents are designed to be more flexible and conformable to the vessel, making them *less* prone to fracture compared to other stent designs, especially in areas subject to movement and bending (like the SFA). Their design allows them to distribute stress more evenly.\n \n * **C. Stents within chronic total occlusions appear to fracture more:** This is generally TRUE. CTOs often involve heavily calcified and tortuous vessels. Stenting these lesions requires more force and can place greater stress on the stent, increasing fracture risk.\n \n * **D.

The enlarged muscles can compress the popliteal artery during exercise.\n \n * **C. The patient often complains of mild symptoms with paraesthesia, cold foot and cramping after intensive physical training.** This accurately describes the typical symptoms. The compression of the artery during exercise leads to reduced blood flow, causing intermittent claudication-like symptoms such as calf pain (cramping), numbness (paresthesia), and a feeling of coldness in the foot. These symptoms are usually triggered by activity and relieved by rest.\n \n Here's why the other options are incorrect:\n \n * **B.

While not definitive, it raises suspicion and guides further investigation.\n \n * **B. Arteriography is only carried out preoperatively to confirm results of ultrasound scans.** Arteriography (angiography) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing PAE. It involves injecting contrast dye into the artery and taking X-ray images. It can visualize the exact location and nature of the entrapment. However, due to its invasive nature, it's typically reserved for pre-operative planning to confirm findings from less invasive imaging.\n \n * **C.

Normal angiograms at rest are often encountered in entrapments.** This is a hallmark of PAE. At rest, the artery isn't being compressed by the anomalous muscle or tendon. Therefore, blood flow appears normal, and the angiogram looks unremarkable.\n \n * **B. The angiograms show an occlusion or severe stenosis during calf muscles contractions.** This is the key diagnostic finding. The dynamic compression of the popliteal artery only occurs when the calf muscles are contracted (e.g., plantarflexion of the foot). The angiogram performed during these maneuvers will reveal the narrowing (stenosis) or complete blockage (occlusion) of the artery.\n \n * **C. Three-vessel run-off is often encountered in PAE.** This is generally true, especially in the early stages. PAE primarily affects the popliteal artery.

Musculotendineous sectioning is the treatment of choice in patients with a normal popliteal artery.** This is correct. PAES often involves muscular or tendinous structures compressing the popliteal artery. If the artery itself is healthy (no aneurysm, thrombosis, or significant stenosis), then releasing the compressing structures is the primary goal. This is typically achieved through sectioning or releasing the offending muscle or tendon.\n \n * **B. Vascular reconstruction should be limited to cases with stable arterial impairment.** This is also correct. Vascular reconstruction (e.g., bypass grafting) is a more invasive procedure. It's reserved for cases where the popliteal artery has been damaged due to chronic compression, leading to aneurysm formation, thrombosis, or significant stenosis. Stable arterial impairment suggests that the artery is damaged enough to warrant reconstruction, but not so acutely compromised that immediate intervention is required without proper planning.\n \n * **C.

Initially, she experienced the pain following meals, but sub-\nsequently the pain became persistent. Over this period of time, she lost 12 kg\nin weight. For the last few months before admission, she started having diar-\nrhea once to twice per day. There was no blood or mucus in the stool. Her past\nmedical history included partial gastrectomy 17 years earlier for benign dis-\nease. On examination, the patient looked cachectic. Her abdomen was slightly\ndistended, and the bowel sounds were increased. There was a high-pitched\nepigastric bruit. Routine blood tests were normal.\n\nFecal fat measurement was 17.6 g/day (normal value <6 g/day). Gastroscopy was per-\nformed, which showed features compatible with atrophic gastritis. This was followed by\ncomputed tomography (CT) scanning of the abdomen, which reported that the pancreas\ncould not be defined well as a result of paucity of retroperitoneal fat. In addition, CT\nshowed non-specific thickening of the small-bowel loops. Endoscopic retrograde chole-\ncystopangreatography (ERCP) was performed, which ruled out pancreatic pathology. A\nsmall-bowel enema did not demonstrate any significant findings. A colonoscopy was\nperformed, which showed two isolated ulcers in the ascending colon and\nraised the possibility of ischaemic colitis. The lateral aortogram of our\npatient demonstrates an occlusion of the coeliac artery and 95% stenosis of the\nsuperior mesenteric artery.

Abdominal pain developed 4 days prior and he had\nbeen hospitalized at another hospital. The abdominal pain was severe (numeric\nrating scale, 8/10), and included steady epigastric pain that had lasted for 5 h\nbefore pain killer administration at the hospital. Thereafter he suffered from\nepigastric discomfort, in particular after meals. He was a social drinker and\nquit smoking 4 years prior after 30 years of cigarette smoking. There was no\nrecent history of peptic ulcer symptoms, heavy alcohol drinking, blunt\nabdominal trauma, arrhythmia or past history of abdominal surgery, or aortic\nangiography. Vital signs at the time of initial presentation were blood pressure (BP) of\n135/93 mmHg (not on antihypertensive medication), pulse rate (PR) of 73/\nmin, respiratory rate (RR) of 20/min, and body temperature (BT) of\n38.1 \u00b0C.

SMA dissection:** This is the most likely answer because a dissection involves a tear in the inner layer of the SMA, allowing blood to flow between the layers of the vessel wall. This can create a false lumen, which can compress the true lumen, leading to narrowing and eventually occlusion over a *long segment* of the artery. The intramural hematoma (blood within the vessel wall) also contributes to the narrowing. Dissections often propagate along the vessel length, explaining the segmental nature.\n \n Here's why the other options are less likely:\n \n * **A. SMA embolism:** Emboli typically cause *abrupt* occlusion at a specific point in the vessel. While they can cause significant ischemia, they usually don't result in long, gradual narrowing. They tend to lodge at bifurcations or points of narrowing, causing a more localized blockage.\n \n * **B. SMA thrombosis:** Thrombosis can occur in situ (at the site) or as a result of an embolus.

However, the surgical site is prone to restenosis (re-narrowing) due to intimal hyperplasia (thickening of the inner lining of the artery). Patch angioplasty significantly reduces the risk of restenosis compared to primary closure.

Distal embolization of atheromatous material from vertebral or basilar artery lesions:** This is a very common cause of posterior circulation strokes. Atherosclerosis (plaque buildup) in the vertebral and basilar arteries can lead to the formation of thrombi (blood clots) or the dislodgement of atheromatous debris (cholesterol, calcium, etc.). These emboli then travel distally, occluding smaller arteries in the posterior circulation (e.g., cerebellar arteries, branches of the basilar artery), leading to infarction.\n \n * **D. Traumatic or spontaneous dissection of the vertebral artery:** Vertebral artery dissection involves a tear in the inner lining of the artery wall. This tear can lead to blood accumulating between the layers of the artery wall, forming a hematoma. This hematoma can narrow the artery, reducing blood flow, or it can serve as a source of thrombus formation and subsequent embolization.

Venous-access catheters:** Catheters, especially central venous catheters (CVCs), are a well-known risk factor for upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The catheter itself can damage the vein wall, leading to endothelial injury and activation of the coagulation cascade. It also creates a foreign body within the vein, promoting thrombus formation.\n \n * **B. Callus from fractured clavicle or rib:** A callus is the bony tissue that forms during the healing process of a fracture. A large or improperly formed callus, especially after a clavicle or rib fracture, can compress the subclavian or axillary vein, leading to venous stasis and increasing the risk of thrombosis. This is a component of Thoracic Outlet Syndrome.\n \n * **C. Local tumor/malignancy:** Tumors in the chest or upper extremity can directly compress or invade the subclavian or axillary vein, causing venous obstruction and thrombosis.

Thrombolysis:** This is a crucial intervention in the acute phase (within 14 days) of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The goal is to dissolve the clot quickly, restore blood flow, and prevent long-term complications like post-thrombotic syndrome. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is often preferred in proximal upper extremity DVT as it allows for targeted delivery of the thrombolytic agent directly into the clot, potentially improving efficacy and reducing systemic bleeding risks compared to systemic thrombolysis.\n \n * **E. Systemic Heparin:** Heparin (usually low molecular weight heparin - LMWH) is an anticoagulant that prevents further clot propagation. It doesn't dissolve the existing clot but stabilizes it and allows the body's natural thrombolytic mechanisms to work.

The patient was operated on electively on the next available operating\nlist.\n\nRoutine blood investigations, chest X-ray and ECG were all performed, and in\nview of the magnitude of the procedure, echocardiogram and lung function tests\nwere also ordered. They were all satisfactory. Because the bacteriology of the infec-\ntion was not known preoperatively in this patient, intravenous combination antibac-\nterial therapy with teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin, co-amoxiclav and metronidazole was\ngiven immediately before surgery.\n\nThe anaesthetised patient was catheterised, prepared and draped so that the\nabdomen and both legs were exposed. First, both superficial femoral veins were\nsimultaneously dissected out by two operative teams and the branches divided\nbetween clips from the profunda femoris vein to the knee joint. The femoral veins\nwere left in situ whilst the abdomen was opened, exposing the graft and obtaining\ncontrol of the proximal infrarenal aorta and the right common iliac bifurcation.\nThe graft was encased in fibrous tissue, making dissection difficult and hazardous.\nThe underlying prosthesis showed poor tissue incorporation and there was a local-\nised abscess between the graft and the duodenum, which was evacuated and cul-\ntured. The left groin was exposed, obtaining control of the common femoral\nartery, its branches and the profunda femoris artery. After systemic heparinisation,\nthe vessels were clamped and the infected graft excised and sent for culture. The\ngraft bed was washed repeatedly with povidone iodine and hydrogen peroxide.\n\nOne femoral vein was excised, reversed and inserted end-to-end from the infrare-\nnal aorta to the right common iliac artery bifurcation using 4/0 polypropylene\nsutures. Size discrepancy at the aortic anastomosis was overcome by \u201cfishmouth-\ning\u201d the end of the vein to prevent the angulation associated with spatulation. The other femoral vein was reversed and anastomosed end to side to\nthe intra-abdominal part of the vein graft and to the left common femoral artery. Both veins were led through a fresh tunnel and surrounded by greater\nmomentum to avoid contact with the bed of the infected graft. The arterial anasto-\nmoses were covered by gentamicin-impregnated collagen foam and the wounds\nwere closed with suction drainage. Antibiotic prophylaxis and low molecular\nweight heparin were continued postoperatively. Despite the copious pus around\nthe graft, no organisms were grown in the laboratory. Combination antibiotic ther-\napy was stopped after 7 days but co-amoxiclav was continued empirically for a\nfurther 5 weeks\n\nExposed grafts present a difficult problem for achieving skin closure and the\naddition of a local muscle flap in the groin to graft replacement with autologous\n(femoropopliteal) vein is the most certain method of cure. The author\u2019s preference\nis a rectus femoris flap for this.\n\nThe patient had the most common complication of this operation, which was a\nlarge seroma in the left thigh and a smaller one in the right thigh despite prolonged\nsuction drainage. These were aspirated repeatedly and resolved after 3 weeks,\nalthough in other cases reoperation and reinsertion of a drain may be required.\nIntestinal obstruction is no more common following this operation than other\nabdominal procedures.\nThe patient otherwise made a good recovery and was discharged from hospital\nat 14 days. The graft and pus swabs were sterile so most of the antibiotics were\nstopped at 1 week but the co-amoxiclav was continued for 6 weeks on empirical\ngrounds.\n\nWhat routine follow-up investigations should be performed?", "choices": ["Abdominal CT scan.", "Abdominal ultrasound.", "Graft duplex scans.", "Abdominal X-ray.", "Erythrocyte sedimentation rate."], "correct_answer": ["C"], "explanation": "Here's why graft duplex scans are the most appropriate routine follow-up investigation in this case:\n \n * **Graft Surveillance:** The primary goal of follow-up is to monitor the patency and function of the newly placed autologous vein graft.

It's a rare but life-threatening condition because it can lead to massive gastrointestinal bleeding.\n \n Let's analyze why the other options are insufficient:\n \n * **A. Gastroscopy:** While gastroscopy can visualize the upper GI tract (esophagus, stomach, and duodenum), it's unlikely to directly visualize the fistula itself. The bleeding from an AEF is often intermittent and may not be actively occurring during the gastroscopy. Furthermore, the fistula may be subtle and easily missed.\n \n * **B. Computerized Tomography (CT):** A standard CT scan may not always detect an AEF. While it can show signs of inflammation or fluid collections near the aorta and duodenum, it often lacks the sensitivity to definitively identify the fistula. *However, a CT angiogram (CTA) is a much better option and is often the first-line imaging", "source": "case_studies"}

The proximal\nanastomosis was made end to end, and the iliac end to side. Polypropylene\nsutures were used.

Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA):** Steal syndrome can sometimes be exacerbated by stenosis or occlusion in the inflow artery proximal to the AV fistula or in the outflow artery distal to the fistula. PTA can open up these narrowed vessels, improving blood flow to the distal limb and alleviating the steal.\n \n * **B. Flow reduction procedures (banding, plication, or tapering of the AV fistula):** Steal syndrome occurs when the AV fistula diverts too much blood away from the distal limb. Reducing the flow through the fistula can restore adequate perfusion to the hand and fingers. Banding, plication, or tapering are surgical techniques to constrict the fistula, thereby reducing its flow.\n \n * **C. AV fistula closure:** This is the most definitive solution.

Complications secondary to diabetes mellitus**. Here's why:\n \n * **Diabetes Mellitus and Amputation:** Diabetes is a leading cause of peripheral artery disease (PAD), nerve damage (neuropathy), and impaired wound healing. These complications, especially when combined, significantly increase the risk of foot ulcers, infections, and ultimately, the need for amputation. High blood sugar levels damage blood vessels, reducing blood flow to the extremities. Neuropathy reduces sensation, making it difficult to detect injuries or infections early. Impaired wound healing makes it harder for the body to fight off infections and repair damaged tissue.\n \n Here's why the other options are less likely:\n \n * **A.

The swollen limb had slightly increased firmness on\npalpation throughout its entire length except for the soft tissue mass areas.\n\u2022 Multiple soft tissue masses were easily compressible and scattered from the\ndorsum of foot to the upper thigh; their diameters varied between 2 and 8 cm.\n\u2022 Similar lesions were also noticed at the left perineum, left labia, left lower\nabdomen, and left flank. Diffuse swelling along the medial side of left foot\ncollapsed spontaneously when the foot was elevated.\n\u2022 Further evaluation of the skeletal system revealed the left lower extremity\nto be 5.0 cm longer\u20143.0 cm longer in the tibia and 2.0 cm longer in the\nfemur\u2014in total length than the right lower extremity, accompanied by pel-\nvic tilt and compensatory scoliosis of the lower spine.\n\u2022 However, the patient had minimal limitation of her daily activities except\nfor moderate limping.\n\u2022 Family history and past history were unremarkable except for a vague his-\ntory of cellulitis along the affected limb.\n\nThis patient underwent a thorough investigation of the nature and extent of the con-\ngenital vascular malformation (CVM) involved.\nA combination of various non- to minimally-invasive studies were performed to\nconfirm the clinical impression of venolymphatic malformation (VLM): duplex\nultrasonography, whole-body blood-pool scintigraphy (WBBPS), magnetic reso-\nnance image (MRI) study, transarterial lung perfusion scintigraphy (TLPS), and/or\nradionuclide lymphoscintigraphy.\nThe primary hemodynamic impact and the secondary musculoskeletal impact of\nthe venous malformation (VM) were assessed as the main CVM lesion in addition\nto the extent/degree of each component of the VM, truncular (T) and extratruncular\n(ET) form, involved in the extremity.\nA thorough skeletal evaluation of the long-bone growth discrepancy of the lower\nextremity and the degree of pelvic tilt with its compensatory scoliosis was also\nmade with conventional bone X-rays.\nThe TLPS assessment was performed substituting arteriographic investigation of\nthe lower extremity for the possible hidden micro-arteriovenous malformation\n(AVM) lesion, which was marginally indicated due to an unusually increased venous\nflow by the isolated VM lesion alone on the duplex scan under the normally devel-\noped and functioning deep vein system.\n\nAn ascending phlebography was also performed together with the percutaneous\ndirect-puncture phlebography as a therapeutic guide; mandatory confirmation of the\npresence of a normal deep vein system of the lower extremity was made before\nstarting the treatment to the infiltrating ET-form lesion of the VM.\nThe final diagnosis confirmed extensive involvement of the VM as an infiltrating\ntype of the ET form causing serious clinical impact directly to the venous system\nhemodynamically as well as to the skeletal system to induce abnormal long-bone\ngrowth of the left lower extremity. A moderate degree of venectasia as a T form of\nVM along the left femoral-popliteal vein segment was also found, by WBBPS, MRI\nand duplex scan, and subsequently confirmed by separate ascending phlebography.\n\nA venectasia of the femoral vein was assessed to have a limited clinical signifi-\ncance at this stage in comparison to the ET-form lesions of the VM.\nThe lymphatic malformation (LM) component which is mixed with the ET form of\nVM, was confirmed as the ET form, giving minimum and limited clinical impact so\nthat a conservative management/observation was instituted for this LM component.\nTherefore, the ET-form lesions of VM along the knee region were selected for\nactive treatment as a priority; this was followed by the ankle and foot lesions.\nThe primary indication to initiate the treatment immediately was that these\nlesions were potentially limb-threatening (e.g., hemarthrosis) due to their proximity\nto the joints with increased vulnerability to repeated trauma, especially as a cause of\nher knee symptoms.\nThe treatment was further indicated to arrest/slow down their impact on abnor-\nmal long-bone growth.\nMultiple infiltrating ET lesions of the VM along the knee region, which is surgi-\ncally not amenable, were selected for ethanol sclerotherapy as independent therapy.\nMultisession ethanol sclerotherapy was given using the absolute ethanol in the range\nof 80 to 100% concentration in calculated dosage\u2014not exceeding 1.0 mg/kg of body\nweight as maximum dose per session\u2014by direct puncture technique under general\nanesthesia. Close cardiopulmonary monitoring during the procedure was ensured to\ncontrol and/or prevent transient pulmonary hypertension by the unavoidable spillage\nof ethanol into the systemic circulation from the lesion during treatment.\nThe symptomatic lesions along the knee with recurrent painful swelling following\nminor injuries were controlled well without complication/morbidity and substantially\nreduced the risk of intra-articular bleeding and subsequent hemarthrosis. Subsequently,\nthe ET-form VM lesions at the foot and ankle underwent surgical excision following\npreoperative multisession ethanol and N-butyl cyanoacrylic glue embolosclerother-\napy with much reduced perioperative morbidity to improve foot function.\n\nFollowing successful control of multiple VM lesions along the knee, ankle, and\nfoot with priority as a potentially limb-threatening condition, other VM lesions,\nscattered throughout the lower extremity, were also treated with absolute ethanol to\nassist further attempts to arrest the abnormal long-bone growth of the lower extrem-\nity. The abnormal long-bone growth is attributed to these VM lesions scattered\nwithin the muscular structure of the lower extremity in the extensive infiltrating type\nof ET, with significant impact on the venous circulation along the epiphyseal plate.\nIn addition to the multisession embolosclerotherapy as independent and/or adjunct\nperioperative therapy to the VM lesions, the conservative supportive measures to\nimprove and/or maintain overall venous function have been supplemented with the use\nof a graded compression above-knee stocking to prevent chronic venous insufficiency.\nThe final decision for the T-form lesion was left femoral-popliteal venectasia, but\nit was decided to defer treatment until urgent treatment of the ET form of the VM\nwas finished, but to keep it under close observation. It might eventually require\ntreatment (e.g., venorrhaphy, venous bypass) to prevent development of venous\nthromboembolism when significant venous flow/volume reduction should occur\nfollowing successful control of the ET form of VM lesions. The hemodynamic con-\nsequences of the treatment of such extensive ET-form lesions directly affect total\nvenous blood volume through the deep vein system.\nThe LM component in this patient was treated only with complex decongestive\ntherapy (CDT) in order to prevent full development of lymphedema. The infiltrating\nET form of LM detected together with the ET form of VM has been shown to put extra\nburden on the marginally normal lymph-conducting system on lymphoscinti-graphic\nevaluation. Therefore, continuous surveillance for aggressive preventive measurement\nof local to systemic cellulitis along this ET form of LM lesions is mandated.\nThis patient will continue to be managed by the multidisciplinary team of the\nCVM Clinic at regular intervals for her entire lifetime, through periodical follow-up\nassessment of the treatment results and the natural course of the untreated lesions.\n\nWhat is the first priority in the management of this patient?", "choices": ["Correction of scoliosis", "Correction of bone length discrepancy", "Control of abnormal hemodynamic status of lower extremity by vascular lesions", "Correction of gait with physical therapy and shoe adjustment", "Biopsy of the soft tissue mass"], "correct_answer": ["C"], "explanation": "Here's why option C, \"Control of abnormal hemodynamic status of lower extremity by vascular lesions,\" is the correct first priority in the management of this patient:\n \n * **Limb-Threatening Potential:** The passage explicitly states that the lesions along the knee were treated as a priority because they were \"potentially limb-threatening (e.g., hemarthrosis) due to their proximity to the joints with increased vulnerability to repeated trauma.\" Controlling the vascular lesions directly addresses this immediate threat.\n \n * **Impact on Bone Growth:** The passage also mentions that treatment was indicated to \"arrest/slow down their impact on abnormal long-bone growth.\" The abnormal hemodynamic status caused by the vascular malformations is directly contributing to the bone length discrepancy.

It is detectable on ultrasound.** This is a significant advantage. Foam's echogenicity (ability to reflect ultrasound waves) allows the physician to visualize its spread and distribution within the vein in real-time. This is crucial for ensuring adequate coverage of the targeted vein segment and minimizing the risk of extravasation (leakage outside the vein). Liquid sclerosing agents are much harder to see on ultrasound, making precise delivery more challenging.\n \n * **D.

An AV fistula, using the end of the proximal saphenous vein sewn to the side of the superficial femoral artery.** This is a reasonable option.

The saphenous vein should not be used for AV fistula, since it represents collateral drainage from the leg in the event of recurrent thrombosis.** While the saphenous vein *can* serve as collateral drainage, the benefit of preventing re-thrombosis with an AV fistula in this specific scenario outweighs the potential loss of this collateral pathway.
