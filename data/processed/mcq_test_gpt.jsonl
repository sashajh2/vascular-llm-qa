The left limb of the graft had been anas-\ntomosed to the common femoral artery and the right limb to the common iliac\nbifurcation. Postoperatively he had suffered a mild groin wound infection,\nwhich had healed with antibiotics. At follow-up he complained of left calf and\nthigh claudication. On examination, he appeared generally well with a mid-\nline abdominal scar and a left vertical groin scar. He had good right femoral\npulse but an absent left femoral pulse.\n\nA duplex scan showed an occluded left limb of the aortic graft with patent common\nfemoral arteries. There was no evidence of any stenosis of the left common femoral\nartery but a perigraft fluid collection was noted around the intra-abdominal portion\nof the graft.\n\nA CT scan confirmed the presence of fluid and gas around the intra-abdominal\nportion of the graft and the occlusion of the left limb, indicating graft infection. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed the occluded left\nlimb of the aortic graft and showed a stenosis at the origin of the right graft limb,\npresumably as a result of external compression. Aspiration of the perigraft collec-\ntion would have allowed preoperative bacterial culture but was considered to be too\ndifficult to perform safely.\n\nIn situ replacement with autologous vein was chosen because of the reduced risk\nof persistent infection.Femoropopliteal vein was used as it is ideally suited to supra-inguinal graft\nreplacement as it is relatively thick-walled, is of adequate diameter and has suffi-\ncient length.\n\nA duplex scan of the femoral veins confirmed that they were patent and of ade-\nquate calibre. The patient was operated on electively on the next available operating\nlist.\n\nRoutine blood investigations, chest X-ray and ECG were all performed, and in\nview of the magnitude of the procedure, echocardiogram and lung function tests\nwere also ordered. They were all satisfactory. Because the bacteriology of the infec-\ntion was not known preoperatively in this patient, intravenous combination antibac-\nterial therapy with teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin, co-amoxiclav and metronidazole was\ngiven immediately before surgery.\n\nThe anaesthetised patient was catheterised, prepared and draped so that the\nabdomen and both legs were exposed. First, both superficial femoral veins were\nsimultaneously dissected out by two operative teams and the branches divided\nbetween clips from the profunda femoris vein to the knee joint. The femoral veins\nwere left in situ whilst the abdomen was opened, exposing the graft and obtaining\ncontrol of the proximal infrarenal aorta and the right common iliac bifurcation.\nThe graft was encased in fibrous tissue, making dissection difficult and hazardous.\nThe underlying prosthesis showed poor tissue incorporation and there was a local-\nised abscess between the graft and the duodenum, which was evacuated and cul-\ntured. The left groin was exposed, obtaining control of the common femoral\nartery, its branches and the profunda femoris artery. After systemic heparinisation,\nthe vessels were clamped and the infected graft excised and sent for culture. The\ngraft bed was washed repeatedly with povidone iodine and hydrogen peroxide.\n\nOne femoral vein was excised, reversed and inserted end-to-end from the infrare-\nnal aorta to the right common iliac artery bifurcation using 4/0 polypropylene\nsutures. Size discrepancy at the aortic anastomosis was overcome by “fishmouth-\ning” the end of the vein to prevent the angulation associated with spatulation. The other femoral vein was reversed and anastomosed end to side to\nthe intra-abdominal part of the vein graft and to the left common femoral artery. Both veins were led through a fresh tunnel and surrounded by greater\nmomentum to avoid contact with the bed of the infected graft. The arterial anasto-\nmoses were covered by gentamicin-impregnated collagen foam and the wounds\nwere closed with suction drainage. Antibiotic prophylaxis and low molecular\nweight heparin were continued postoperatively. Despite the copious pus around\nthe graft, no organisms were grown in the laboratory.

This significantly increases the risk of graft infection, which is a devastating complication.\n \n * **Need for Graft Excision:** Because of the high risk of infection, the infected graft needs to be removed.\n \n * **Autologous Vein Replacement:** Using autologous vein (a vein from the patient's own body) for graft replacement is preferred over synthetic grafts in infected fields. Autologous tissue is more resistant to infection and promotes better healing.\n \n * **Muscle Flap Coverage:** A muscle flap provides several benefits in this scenario:\n \n  * **Vascularity:** Muscle flaps bring a rich blood supply to the area, which aids in wound healing and helps to eradicate infection.\n  * **Coverage:** The muscle flap provides a physical barrier, covering the new graft and protecting it from further contamination.\n  * **Antibiotic Delivery:** The increased blood flow to the area also enhances the delivery", "source": "case_studies"}

As described in our patient, it usually takes more than 1 year from the first presentation of the symptoms until the final diagnosis is made.** This is often true. CVI is a challenging diagnosis because the symptoms are often vague, non-specific, and can mimic other more common conditions. Patients may be worked up for other gastrointestinal issues before CVI is considered. The delay in diagnosis is a significant clinical problem.\n \n * **C. It presents clinically as an undiagnosed malignancy.** This is a clever distractor because the symptoms of CVI (weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting) can overlap significantly with those of abdominal malignancies. The workup often includes imaging and investigations that are also used to rule out cancer. The weight loss and abdominal pain, in particular, can lead clinicians to initially suspect malignancy.\n \n * **E. It may cause malabsorption.** This is correct. Chronic ischemia to the intestines reduces their ability to absorb nutrients effectively. The reduced blood supply damages the intestinal lining, impairing its absorptive function.

It helps to identify injuries that might otherwise be missed, allowing for timely intervention.\n \n * **C. Angiography is reserved for stable patients.** This is generally true. Angiography, particularly conventional angiography, is an invasive procedure. Unstable patients need immediate resuscitation and stabilization.

The pain\nincreased during the day and was unbearable in the evening after work. The\npatient works as a barber and needs to stand most of the day. His past medical\nhistory is significant for a motor vehicle accident 10 years ago. He only takes\nNSAIDs occasionally to relieve his leg pain. The patient finally decided to\nseek medical attention.

DU to assess venous valve function (Correct Answer):**\n  * **Rationale:** Duplex ultrasound (DU) is the gold standard for evaluating venous insufficiency and varicose veins. It allows for direct visualization of the veins, assessment of valve competence (whether the valves are preventing backflow of blood), and mapping of the venous system. In this case, the patient has signs and symptoms strongly suggestive of venous insufficiency (varicose veins, leg pain, fatigue, edema, worsening symptoms with standing). DU will help determine the extent and location of venous reflux, which is crucial for planning appropriate treatment.\n \n * **A. Hand held Doppler to assess reflux:**\n  * **Rationale:** While a handheld Doppler can detect reflux, it is less precise and provides less information than a full duplex ultrasound. It doesn't allow for visualization of the veins or detailed mapping of the venous system. It's a good screening tool, but not sufficient for a comprehensive evaluation when considering treatment options.\n \n * **C.

Takayasu arteritis (TA) causes inflammation and stenosis (narrowing) of arteries. In this case, the patient has significant stenosis or occlusion of multiple major arteries, including the left subclavian artery (making the left arm BP uncheckable), the right innominate artery, and the right subclavian artery. These blockages significantly affect blood flow to the extremities. The BP reading in the right arm is likely lower than her actual central blood pressure due to the arterial narrowing. The true BP could be normal or even elevated due to the body's compensatory mechanisms to maintain perfusion to vital organs.\n \n * **Why B is True:** In patients with suspected or confirmed Takayasu arteritis, measuring blood pressure in all four extremities is crucial. This helps to identify discrepancies in blood pressure between limbs, which is a hallmark of large vessel arteritis affecting the subclavian and other arteries.

The patient thought that this might have been\nrelated to his arm position and chose to do nothing further until the next day, when\nthe same event occurred. At this point, he called his physician and was advised to\nreturn immediately. An emergent carotid duplex scan was ordered. The scan now\nshowed progression to a category 80–99% stenosis with plaque once again of mixed\nconsistency.\n\nThe patient now had two clear indications for proceeding with carotid endarter-\nectomy: the onset of symptoms in the territory of the carotid lesion, and progression\nof the lesion to an 80–99% stenosis. Two additional decisions also had to be consid-\nered: the timing of operation and whether brain imaging was indicated. In view of\nthe fact that the patient had an appropriate carotid artery lesion, and the symptoms\nwere typical for hemispheric transient ischaemic events in the distribution of the\ncarotid lesion, information gained from brain imaging such as computed tomogra-\nphy (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would be of limited value.\nTherefore, the cost/benefit ratio for brain imaging was clearly unfavorable. The\ntiming of carotid endarterectomy was urgent. The patient had a new onset of tran-\nsient ischaemic attacks and evidence of plaque progression. Therefore, the patient\nwas now at highest risk of a hemispheric stroke. The optimum management for this\npatient would be emergent admission to the hospital and rapid evaluation for opera-\ntion, including the patient’s cardiac status.

Before this, EEG\nelectrodes were placed for intraoperative monitoring. An arterial line was placed for\nblood pressure monitoring, and general anaesthesia was administered. A vertical\nincision along the anterior border of the sternomastoid muscle was made. The facial\nvein was divided, and the common carotid, carotid bifurcation, internal and external\ncarotid arteries were fully mobilized. There was a posterior plaque present in the\ncommon carotid artery, which was nonocclusive. The major plaque build-up was in\nthe bulb of the internal carotid artery, which went a short distance beyond the bulb\ninto the internal carotid artery distally. Beyond this point, the vessel was circumfer-\nentially soft. The distal internal carotid artery was somewhat collapsed, and no dis-\ntal pulse was noted. Since the patient had experienced only transient symptoms and\nnot a completed stroke, it was our plan to use an internal shunt only if there were\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) changes with trial clamping. A bolus of 5000 units of\nheparin was administered, and the internal, external and common carotid arteries\nwere clamped. The EEG was observed: there were no changes. The amplitude and\nfrequency of the EEG wave form were maintained. A longitudinal arteriotomy was\nmade in the common carotid artery and extended through a very tight carotid steno-\nsis. The plaque within the carotid bulb showed evidence of recent intraplaque haem-\norrhage. As we passed through the plaque, we emerged into an unencumbered\ninternal carotid artery distally. A bifurcation endarterectomy was then performed\nwith clean endpoints in the internal, external and common carotid arteries.

However, the surgical site is prone to restenosis (re-narrowing) due to intimal hyperplasia (thickening of the inner lining of the artery). Patch angioplasty significantly reduces the risk of restenosis compared to primary closure. The patch widens the arteriotomy closure, reducing tension on the suture line and providing a larger luminal diameter.\n \n * **Accommodating Vessel Size:** The description mentions the distal internal carotid artery was somewhat collapsed. A primary closure in this situation could lead to narrowing of the vessel lumen, especially if there's any degree of vessel wall tension. A patch angioplasty avoids this by augmenting the vessel diameter.\n \n * **Plaque Characteristics:** The plaque had evidence of recent intraplaque hemorrhage. This suggests the plaque is unstable and potentially friable. A patch angioplasty provides a more secure and less constricting closure, minimizing the risk of disrupting the newly cleaned intimal surface and causing further complications.\n \n * **Surgical Technique:** Patch angioplasty", "source": "case_studies"}

Infection:** This is evident from the description of the ulcer as \"infected\" with a discharge. Elevated CRP and leucocyte count further support the presence of an infection.\n \n * **B. Atherosclerotic macroangiopathy:** The patient's history of hypertension, diabetes, and smoking are all significant risk factors for atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arteries). While the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were reported as present, this doesn't rule out macroangiopathy. The presence of pulses doesn't guarantee adequate blood flow to the microvasculature of the foot, especially in the presence of other risk factors. Atherosclerosis can reduce blood flow to the lower extremities, impairing wound healing and increasing susceptibility to infection.\n \n * **D. Neuropathy:** This is a very common complication of diabetes. Diabetic neuropathy can cause loss of sensation in the feet.

Rupture:** While rupture is a serious complication of aneurysms in general, anastomotic aneurysms (especially smaller ones like these) have a lower risk of rupture compared to native aneurysms. The graft material and surrounding scar tissue often provide some containment. While rupture is possible, it's not the *most common* initial complication.\n \n * **B.

Detecting and classifying endoleaks is crucial, as some require intervention.\n  * **Aneurysm sac size:** Monitoring the aneurysm sac size is important to confirm that it's shrinking or at least stable, indicating successful exclusion from the circulation.\n  * **Patency of branch vessels:** To ensure that important arteries arising from the aorta (e.g., subclavian, carotid) remain open and unobstructed.\n  * **Aortic remodeling:** To assess for any changes in the aorta above or below the stent graft.\n \n * **Renal Function:** Contrast-enhanced CTAs can be nephrotoxic (harmful to the kidneys). Therefore, monitoring renal function", "source": "case_studies"}
{"id": "19.2", "question": "A 54-year-old man presents to your clinic complaining of bilateral rest pain of\nthe toes and a past medical history of cramping pain in his calves when he\nwalks. The patient had a 30-pack year smoking history and remains an active\nsmoker. Clinical examination revealed an absent left femoral pulse and a\ndiminished right femoral pulse. Popliteal and pedal pulses were absent on\nboth sides. Bilateral carotid bruits were noted. Palpation of the abdominal\naorta was normal. The patient was also moderately breathless on minimal\nexertion and had a chronic productive cough. The ECG was normal, a chest\nX-ray showed evidence for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nFEV1 was 950 mL not enhanced after inhalation of bronchodilators. The\npatient was currently taking medications for hypertension and elevated\ncholesterol.\n\nThe patient had a Duplex-scan with measurements of the ABI that was\n0.40 on the right side and of 0.29 on the left. The Duplex showed an occlusion\nof the left external iliac artery and significant stenoses of the right common\nand external iliac arteries with occlusion of both superficial femoral arteries.\nThe patient had also mild bilateral carotid artery stenosis.\nThe duplex scan was followed by digital percutaneous subtraction contrast\nangiography that showed an occlusion of the left external iliac artery and a\nsignificant stenosis of the right common and external iliac arteries. Severe\nocclusive lesions were also seen in both common femoral arteries. The superficial femoral artery was occluded on both sides.\nSignificant lesions of the crural arteries were also present.\n\nThis patient had no previous myocardial infarction and no clinical sign of myo-\ncardial ischemia. The ECG and cardiac echography were considered as normal. No further cardiac evaluation was considered in this case.\n\nWhich of the following surgical options will you consider in this case?", "choices": ["Aortobifemoral bypass (ABF) with distal anastomosis on both profunda femoris\narteries", "Percutaneous bilateral iliac stenting with left external iliac recanalization", "Bilateral iliac stenting with left external iliac recanalization and bilateral femo-\nral bypass to the profunda", "Right iliac stenting with right femoral bypass to the profunda and crossover\nfemorofemoral bypass to the left profunda", "Right iliac stenting with a right femoral to profunda endarterectomy with patch\nplasty and crossover femorofemoral bypass to the left profunda"], "correct_answer": ["D"], "explanation": "Here's a breakdown of why option D is the most appropriate surgical approach for this patient, along with why the other options are less suitable:\n \n **Why Option D (Right iliac stenting with right femoral bypass to the profunda and crossover femorofemoral bypass to the left profunda) is the Best Choice:**\n \n * **Addressing the Iliac Disease:** The patient has significant iliac artery disease on both sides, with a complete occlusion on the left and severe stenosis on the right. Stenting the right iliac artery addresses the inflow issue on that side, improving blood supply to the right leg.\n * **Bypassing the Femoral Occlusions:** Both superficial femoral arteries (SFAs) are occluded, and there are severe lesions in the common femoral arteries. A femoral bypass to the profunda femoris artery (deep femoral artery) on the right side provides direct blood flow to the lower leg, bypassing the occluded SFA.\n * **Addressing the Left Leg Ischemia:** The left external iliac artery is completely occluded. A crossover femorofemoral bypass from the right profunda femoris artery to the left profunda femoris artery provides blood flow to the left leg, bypassing the iliac occlusion.
