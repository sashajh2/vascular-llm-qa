It is important to remember that it is necessary for the peroneal artery to have patency to the anterior or posterior tibial artery to perfuse the entire foot. Choice B is incorrect because this is more of a presentation in a patient with acute occlusion of only the popliteal artery, as in a posterior knee dislocation.

{"id": "41.8", "question": "A 66-year-old man, an ex-smoker with hypertension and hypercholesterolae-\nmia, had undergone a Dacron bifurcated aortic graft and bilateral ureteric\nstents for an inflammatory aortic aneurysm with ureteric obstruction at\nanother hospital 4 years previously. The left limb of the graft had been anas-\ntomosed to the common femoral artery and the right limb to the common iliac\nbifurcation. Postoperatively he had suffered a mild groin wound infection,\nwhich had healed with antibiotics. At follow-up he complained of left calf and\nthigh claudication. On examination, he appeared generally well with a mid-\nline abdominal scar and a left vertical groin scar. He had good right femoral\npulse but an absent left femoral pulse.\n\nA duplex scan showed an occluded left limb of the aortic graft with patent common\nfemoral arteries. There was no evidence of any stenosis of the left common femoral\nartery but a perigraft fluid collection was noted around the intra-abdominal portion\nof the graft.\n\nA CT scan confirmed the presence of fluid and gas around the intra-abdominal\nportion of the graft and the occlusion of the left limb, indicating graft infection. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed the occluded left\nlimb of the aortic graft and showed a stenosis at the origin of the right graft limb,\npresumably as a result of external compression. Aspiration of the perigraft collec-\ntion would have allowed preoperative bacterial culture but was considered to be too\ndifficult to perform safely.\n\nIn situ replacement with autologous vein was chosen because of the reduced risk\nof persistent infection.Femoropopliteal vein was used as it is ideally suited to supra-inguinal graft\nreplacement as it is relatively thick-walled, is of adequate diameter and has suffi-\ncient length.\n\nA duplex scan of the femoral veins confirmed that they were patent and of ade-\nquate calibre. The patient was operated on electively on the next available operating\nlist.\n\nRoutine blood investigations, chest X-ray and ECG were all performed, and in\nview of the magnitude of the procedure, echocardiogram and lung function tests\nwere also ordered. They were all satisfactory. Because the bacteriology of the infec-\ntion was not known preoperatively in this patient, intravenous combination antibac-\nterial therapy with teicoplanin, ciprofloxacin, co-amoxiclav and metronidazole was\ngiven immediately before surgery.\n\nThe anaesthetised patient was catheterised, prepared and draped so that the\nabdomen and both legs were exposed. First, both superficial femoral veins were\nsimultaneously dissected out by two operative teams and the branches divided\nbetween clips from the profunda femoris vein to the knee joint. The femoral veins\nwere left in situ whilst the abdomen was opened, exposing the graft and obtaining\ncontrol of the proximal infrarenal aorta and the right common iliac bifurcation.\nThe graft was encased in fibrous tissue, making dissection difficult and hazardous.\nThe underlying prosthesis showed poor tissue incorporation and there was a local-\nised abscess between the graft and the duodenum, which was evacuated and cul-\ntured. The left groin was exposed, obtaining control of the common femoral\nartery, its branches and the profunda femoris artery. After systemic heparinisation,\nthe vessels were clamped and the infected graft excised and sent for culture. The\ngraft bed was washed repeatedly with povidone iodine and hydrogen peroxide.\n\nOne femoral vein was excised, reversed and inserted end-to-end from the infrare-\nnal aorta to the right common iliac artery bifurcation using 4/0 polypropylene\nsutures. Size discrepancy at the aortic anastomosis was overcome by \u201cfishmouth-\ning\u201d the end of the vein to prevent the angulation associated with spatulation. The other femoral vein was reversed and anastomosed end to side to\nthe intra-abdominal part of the vein graft and to the left common femoral artery. Both veins were led through a fresh tunnel and surrounded by greater\nmomentum to avoid contact with the bed of the infected graft. The arterial anasto-\nmoses were covered by gentamicin-impregnated collagen foam and the wounds\nwere closed with suction drainage. Antibiotic prophylaxis and low molecular\nweight heparin were continued postoperatively. Despite the copious pus around\nthe graft, no organisms were grown in the laboratory.

His blood\npressure was 225/110 mmHg. His only complaint was lower extremity fatigue\nwith modest physical activity. A continuous systolic bruit that did not vary\nwith respiration was noted in his epigastrium. There was a femoral-radial\nartery pulse delay. He had palpable pedal pulses, with good capillary fill in his\ntoes. The left border of cardiac dullness was 8 cm to the left of the mid-sternal\nline with a sustained apical impulse. There were no cardiac murmurs. An elec-\ntrocardiogram documented mild left ventricular hypertrophy. His chest film\nrevealed a slightly enlarged heart. There was no rib-notching to suggest col-\nlateral vessels due to a thoracic aortic coarctation. His basic blood chemistries\nand urinalysis were normal. Prior to his referral to our hospital he had under-\ngone an attempted percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the right\nrenal artery. Failure of the renal PTA and refractory hypertension led to his\nadmission for further study and therapy.\n\nConventional aortography was chosen to best define his vascular anatomy because of its\ngreater definition of small arteries. It documented an abdominal aortic narrowing begin-\nning at the CA level and extending below the renal arteries, as well as ostial narrowings of\nboth renal arteries, the celiac artery (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA).\nDeep abdominal ultrasonography prior to his referral had documented abnormal\nmid-abdominal aortic, bilateral renal artery, CA, and SMA velocities, all of which\nexceeded 300 cm/s, compared to a 125 cm/s velocity in the infrarenal aorta. The anatomic detail of the splanchnic and renal circulation revealed by ultrasonography\nwas limited. Similarly, an MRA obtained before the failed PTA did not clearly\ndelineate the suspected anatomic extent of his aortic branch narrowings.\n\nThe left renal artery and SMA distal to their proximal stenotic segments were\ntransected, spatulated, and reimplanted onto the adjacent infrarenal aorta.

The previous winter she had had some finger ulcers\nwhich had, however, been less painful than the current one and which had\nhealed spontaneously. Also of concern to her was that for 6 months the skin of\nher fingers had felt tight, and she had recently been experiencing some diffi-\nculty swallowing, with heartburn. There was no past medical history of note.\nShe had smoked five cigarettes a day for 2 years. There was no history of\nchemical exposure nor of use of vibratory equipment.\n\nOn examination she had a healing ulcer at the tip of the left middle finger.\nThe fingertip was extremely tender. She had mild skin thickening of the fingers\n(sclerodactyly) but elsewhere the skin was normal. She had digital pitting of the\nright index and middle fingers. There were no other abnormal findings.\n\nFull blood count and ESR were normal.

{"id": "34.5", "question": "A 72-year-old white male was referred for evaluation and management fol-\nlowing the finding of an asymptomatic carotid bruit, picked up on routine\nphysical examination by his primary-care physician. The patient was asymp-\ntomatic with respect to ocular or hemispheric ischaemic events. His risk fac-\ntors included a 30-year history of smoking one pack of cigarettes a day, which\nhe quit a year ago. He had hypertension that was controlled well by two drugs.\nHe had no history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, or symptoms\nof peripheral vascular disease. On physical examination, his temporal pulses\nwere equal. His carotid pulses were full and equal, but there was a loud bruit\nover the right carotid bifurcation. His femoral, popliteal, dorsalis paedis and\nposterior tibial pulses were normally palpable bilaterally.\n\nThe patient underwent a bilateral carotid duplex scan. The scan demon-\nstrated a category 60\u201379% right carotid bulb stenosis. The plaque characteristic was\none of mixed consistency, a mildly irregular surface, and minimal calcification. The\nleft carotid bulb showed a category 20\u201359% stenosis. Both vertebral arteries were\nimaged with normal antegrade flow velocities.\n\n\nThe patient was placed on aspirin antiplatelet therapy, begun on a statin,\ncounseled regarding the importance of good blood pressure control including the\nuse of a beta blocker or ACE inhibitor, and given an appointment for a return visit\nin 6 months time for a repeat carotid duplex scan to see whether there was any evi-\ndence of progression. The patient was also counseled regarding the importance of\ncalling the vascular service should he develop ocular or hemispheric transient isch-\naemic attacks within the 6-month interval before his return appointment. \nThe patient did quite well for the next 4 months; then one afternoon, he noted the\nonset of an episode of numbness and weakness of his left hand. The hand was not\ntotally paralyzed, but it was clearly numb, weak and uncoordinated. This cleared\ncompletely within a period of 10 min. The patient thought that this might have been\nrelated to his arm position and chose to do nothing further until the next day, when\nthe same event occurred. At this point, he called his physician and was advised to\nreturn immediately. An emergent carotid duplex scan was ordered. The scan now\nshowed progression to a category 80\u201399% stenosis with plaque once again of mixed\nconsistency.\n\nThe patient now had two clear indications for proceeding with carotid endarter-\nectomy: the onset of symptoms in the territory of the carotid lesion, and progression\nof the lesion to an 80\u201399% stenosis. Two additional decisions also had to be consid-\nered: the timing of operation and whether brain imaging was indicated. In view of\nthe fact that the patient had an appropriate carotid artery lesion, and the symptoms\nwere typical for hemispheric transient ischaemic events in the distribution of the\ncarotid lesion, information gained from brain imaging such as computed tomogra-\nphy (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would be of limited value.\nTherefore, the cost/benefit ratio for brain imaging was clearly unfavorable. The\ntiming of carotid endarterectomy was urgent. The patient had a new onset of tran-\nsient ischaemic attacks and evidence of plaque progression. Therefore, the patient\nwas now at highest risk of a hemispheric stroke. The optimum management for this\npatient would be emergent admission to the hospital and rapid evaluation for opera-\ntion, including the patient\u2019s cardiac status. While this was taking place, it\nwould be appropriate to start the patient on intravenous heparin anticoagulation.\nOnce cleared from a cardiac standpoint, plans should be made to proceed with oper-\nation either that day or the next morning. \n\nThe patient was admitted as an emergency to the hospital and started on intrave-\nnous heparin with a loading dose of 5000 units and a continuing dose of 1000 units/h.\nHe was seen in cardiology consultation, an electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained\nand a stress-echo study was performed. In the absence of any symptoms of coronary\ndisease, a relatively normal ECG, and a stress-echo study showing a 55% ejection\nfraction, the patient was cleared for operation.\n\nThe patient was taken to the operating room the next morning. Before this, EEG\nelectrodes were placed for intraoperative monitoring. An arterial line was placed for\nblood pressure monitoring, and general anaesthesia was administered. A vertical\nincision along the anterior border of the sternomastoid muscle was made. The facial\nvein was divided, and the common carotid, carotid bifurcation, internal and external\ncarotid arteries were fully mobilized. There was a posterior plaque present in the\ncommon carotid artery, which was nonocclusive. The major plaque build-up was in\nthe bulb of the internal carotid artery, which went a short distance beyond the bulb\ninto the internal carotid artery distally. Beyond this point, the vessel was circumfer-\nentially soft. The distal internal carotid artery was somewhat collapsed, and no dis-\ntal pulse was noted. Since the patient had experienced only transient symptoms and\nnot a completed stroke, it was our plan to use an internal shunt only if there were\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) changes with trial clamping. A bolus of 5000 units of\nheparin was administered, and the internal, external and common carotid arteries\nwere clamped. The EEG was observed: there were no changes. The amplitude and\nfrequency of the EEG wave form were maintained. A longitudinal arteriotomy was\nmade in the common carotid artery and extended through a very tight carotid steno-\nsis. The plaque within the carotid bulb showed evidence of recent intraplaque haem-\norrhage. As we passed through the plaque, we emerged into an unencumbered\ninternal carotid artery distally. A bifurcation endarterectomy was then performed\nwith clean endpoints in the internal, external and common carotid arteries. The\nintimectomised surface was then irrigated with heparinised saline, and small bits of\nmedial debris were removed carefully. The intimal endpoint was adherent to the\nmedia. Once we were satisfied that there was no evidence of intimal flap and all of\nthe loose bits of medial debris were removed, attention was turned to closure.\n\nClosure of the arteriotomy should be:", "choices": ["A primary, carefully placed closure with 6\u20130 prolene", "Closure with a patch angioplasty"], "correct_answer": ["B"], "explanation": "", "source": "case_studies"}

Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM) has been\nmanaged by the same primary care physician for the preceding 12 years; glu-\ncose control has never been a problem in this cooperative and well-educated\nindividual. The renal failure was initially managed with appropriate adjust-\nments to diet and medications; the presumptive diagnosis is diabetic nephrop-\nathy. Recent laboratory tests demonstrate a creatinine of 4.1, a blood urea\nnitrogen of 94, a potassium of 4.8, mild proteinuria, and a creatinine clearance\nof 20 mL/min.\n\nA nephrology work-up finds no reversible cause and the patient\u2019s immune status\nprecludes any further consideration of transplantation. The patient is referred for\nconstruction of a hemoaccess.\n\nThe patient is right hand dominant.\nRight: Cephalic (diameter 3.3 mm) and basilic (diameter 3.5 mm) veins course\nthrough both the forearm and upper arm to their junctions with the axillary and bra-\nchial veins respectively; however, both superficial forearm veins demonstrate post-\nthrombotic changes in the forearm. The brachial artery (diameter 4.2 mm) bifurcates\ninto a radial (diameter 2.8 mm) and ulnar (diameter 2.7 mm) artery 3 cm below the\nantecubital crease; the palmar arches are intact. The deep venous structures are normal\nfrom the forearm veins through visualization of the axillary and subclavian veins.\nLeft: The basilic vein is post-thrombotic and thickened in the forearm; it has a\nnormal 3.5-mm diameter lumen just below the elbow continuing into its junction\nwith the brachial vein at mid-humerus. The cephalic vein (diameter 3.5 mm) has a\nnormal luminal surface, extends to the wrist, is superficial, communicates with the\nproximal basilic at the antecubital junction, and remains patent into its junction with\nthe axillary vein. The brachial artery (diameter 4.2 mm) bifurcates into a radial\n(diameter 2.8 mm) and ulnar (diameter 2.7 mm) artery at mid-humerus; the palmar\narches are intact. The deep venous structures are normal from the forearm veins\nthrough visualization of the axillary and subclavian veins.\n\nYour initial hemoaccess has functioned well for 6.4 years, but the hemodialysis\nstaff has noted increasing difficulty obtaining adequate flows for the external\nmachine circuit; arterial pressures were low at 70 mm Hg and venous pressures\nelevated to 350 mm Hg. You are asked to consider revision or a new hemoaccess.\nA new duplex examination demonstrates progressive stenosis of the distal radial\nartery, and multiple sites of localized thrombosis extending into the upper arm\ncephalic vein. You determine that there is no role for angioplasty of the lengthy arte-\nrial stenosis or the multiple venous lesions.\n\nA new hemoaccess is constructed and an excellent thrill achieved. During initial\nmaturation, hemodialysis is continued via the original left arm hemoaccess.\nFortunately, the original left hemoaccess provides sufficient flow for adequate inter-\nval hemodialysis, but 6 weeks later has spontaneously thrombosed. Dialysis using\nthe new hemoaccess is successful and the hemoaccess functions well for thrice\nweekly puncture.Two years later you are again contacted to evaluate this individual.
