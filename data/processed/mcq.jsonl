Performing an ankle-brachial index (ABI) requires an appropriately sized manual blood pressure cuff and a hand-held, continuous-wave Doppler probe. The patient should be in the supine position and allowed to rest before the examination begins. The blood pressure cuff is placed above the ankle. The Doppler probe is used to locate the dorsalis pedis (DP) or posterior tibial (PT) pulse. The pressure cuff is inflated until the Doppler signal is obliterated, and then the cuff is then slowly released. The pressure at which the Doppler signal returns is the ankle pressure. The same process is repeated for both legs (DP and PT signals) and both arms. The arm pressure must be measured with the Doppler probe and the manual blood pressure cuff. To calculate an ABI, the higher ankle pressure (DP or PT) is divided by the highest arm pressure (left or right). Note that the higher arm pressure is used to calculate the ABI for both legs. For this specific case, the highest arm pressure is 150. To calculate on the right, 165/150=1.1, on the left 120/150=0.8. A normal ABI is 0.9 to 1.2.

A TMA will remove infected tissue and will provide him with the greatest amputation stump length. A below-knee amputation (BKA), through-knee amputation (TKA), and above-knee amputation (AKA) are too extreme for the burden of foot infection.

Smoking contributes to worsening peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Peripheral arterial disease results when the arteries narrow due to plaque accumulation which prevents or decreases the amount of oxygen-rich blood reaching your legs. The chemicals in tobacco products increase the rate of plaque formation in arterial walls thereby narrowing the arterial lumen. Smoking also constricts blood vessels and causes blood to clot, ultimately putting PAD patients at a higher risk of further complications such as heart attacks, limb amputations, and death.

Therefore, when performing preoperative imaging to plan an infrapopliteal bypass, a more common target site for anastomosis is the peroneal artery. It is important to remember that it is necessary for the peroneal artery to have patency to the anterior or posterior tibial artery to perfuse the entire foot. Choice B is incorrect because this is more of a presentation in a patient with acute occlusion of only the popliteal artery, as in a posterior knee dislocation. Patients with vascular disease tend to have more distal vessels affected before proximal. Choice A is incorrect because the geniculate arteries themselves are collaterals.

An arterial embolism refers to an acute event where thrombogenic material lodges in an arterial tree, usually at a branching point. Various etiologies exist, including septic and cardiogenic sources. In a patient with atrial fibrillation, a laminated thrombus with a cardiac origin is likely the cause of his embolus. As previously mentioned, when an embolus occurs, it often becomes lodged at an arterial bifurcation, usually at a narrowed peripheral location where the arterial caliber changes. One of the more common locations for obstruction is the common femoral artery at the bifurcation of the superficial femoral artery and profunda femoris, which can lead to an acute arterial cutoff sign as seen in the computed tomography angiogram described in this case. Patients presenting with acute limb ischemia classically present with one or more of the six Ps: pulselessness, pallor, pain, paresthesia, paralysis, and poikilothermia. The man has several of these findings, making the diagnosis of an acute embolic event reasonable. The findings of buttock claudication, erectile dysfunction, and decreased femoral pulses are a classic presentation of Leriche syndrome, which is caused by chronic aortoiliac occlusive disease. Bilateral decreased foot sensation and pain is more likely seen in a patient with diabetic neuropathy and venous stasis. Reproducible calf pain that improves with rest and has decreased signals is consistent with chronic peripheral arterial disease and claudication.

Medical history\nrevealed non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for 3 years and a myocardial\ninfarction (MI) some 5 years ago. The pain in the right leg developed suddenly over\n6 h without associated trauma and became worse over time. On admission, the right\nleg looked pale distally from the level of the knee. There was loss of light touch\nsensation on examination of the foot. The patient had difficulties in wiggling the\ntoes. Plantarflexion and dorsiflexion of the toes were still possible. Palpation of the\ncalf showed soft but tender muscles. Clinical examination of the abdomen showed\nno abnormalities. There was no pulsating mass. Irregular but bounding pulsations\nwere felt in the right femoral artery. Popliteal artery and tibial artery pulsations were\nabsent. Normal pulsations were felt in the left popliteal and posterior tibial artery.\n\nWith the diagnosis of acute arterial ischaemia in mind, a full dose of intravenous\nheparin was administered immediately.\n\nA chest film X-ray showed no abnormalities. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed\natrial fibrillation and signs of an old MI. Laboratory studies were normal. Duplex\nexamination showed a thrombotic occlusion of the right femoral bifurcation and the\nsuperficial femoral artery. A weak flow sign was present in the popliteal artery. The\ntibial arteries were not visualised.\n\nAfter placement of a central venous catheter, the patient was taken to the operat-\ning theatre and the right femoral bifurcation was exposed under local anaesthesia. A transverse arteriotomy confirmed complete thrombotic occlusion of the femoral bifurcation. There was good inflow. Thrombi were removed from the femoral bifurcation, and pulsatile backflow was obtained from the profunda femoris artery. Multiple thrombi were removed from the superficial femoral artery and the popli- teal artery after several passages of Fogarty embolectomy catheters numbers 3 and 4.\n\nIntraoperative angiography showed good patency of the superficial, popliteal and pero-\nneal arteries. The anterior tibial artery was completely occluded. The posterior tibial was patent in its first portion but occluded distally. A small catheter was inserted into\nthe popliteal artery, and 350,000 units of urokinase were infused as a dripping infusion\nover 30 min. Repeated angiography showed further clearance of the posterior tibial\nartery to the level of the ankle joint. The anterior tibial artery was still occluded. It was\ndecided to accept the situation. The arteries were flushed with a diluted heparinised\nsaline solution, and the transverse arteriotomy was closed with the aid of a Dacron\npatch. Sodium bicarbonate was administered intravenously before reperfusion.\n\nPostoperatively, the foot was well vascularised and the patient was able to wiggle\nhis toes almost normally. Pulsations were felt in the posterior tibial artery.\nIntravenous heparin was continued. Brisk diuresis was maintained with mannitol\nand alkalisation of the urine. Repeated laboratory studies showed no evidence of\nacidosis or hyperkalaemia.\n\nSix hours postoperatively, the patient developed significant limb swelling with\naugmentation of pain, venous hypertension and sensory impairment of the foot. A\nperifibular fasciotomy to decompress all four compartments was performed under\ngeneral anaesthesia. Afterwards, the swelling subsided and the fasciotomy wound\nwas closed in a delayed primary fashion after 1 week.\n\nWith the pre- and peroperative diagnosis in mind, which of the following is true?", "choices": ["The patient should be placed under antiplatelet therapy postoperatively in order\nto prevent another episode of embolism.", "Heparin and oral anticoagulants remain the treatment of choice during the post-\noperative period.", "Subsequent investigation with regard to the source of the embolus is not neces-\nsary, because this will not change the medical treatment.", "Postoperative investigation with regard to the source of embolism can be\nlimited to cardiac examinations such as echocardiography and Holter\nmonitoring."], "correct_answer": ["B"], "explanation": "", "source": "case_studies"}

The lower abdomen and both legs were prepared and draped widely\nand IV broad spectrum antibiotics were administered. Closer examination revealed\nthat the left leg had sustained extensive injuries. The foot and distal calf were cold,\npale and mottled. There was a compound injury to the left femur and tibia with\ncomplete disruption of the superficial femoral artery, superficial femoral vein and\nextensive injury to the sciatic nerve. It was decided that primary amputation of the\nleft limb was required. On examination of the right leg there was complete disrup-\ntion of the distal superficial/popliteal artery, a ragged laceration of the popliteal vein\nand significant bruising to branches of the sciatic nerve. There was a shrapnel injury\nto the right hand involving the thumb and middle finger.\n\nImmediate surgical steps were as follows: (a) a proximal thigh tourniquet was\nplaced on the left leg to arrest haemorrhage prior to formal amputation. The lacera-\ntion to the right lower leg was then extended distally to facilitate exposure of the\nneurovascular structures. Control of the superficial femoral and below-knee popli-\nteal artery was obtained and a careful distal embolectomy performed. A Javid shunt\nwas then placed between the right superficial femoral artery and right below-knee\npopliteal vessel. Significant bleeding from a large defect in the popliteal\nvein occurred following shunt insertion; this was repaired using a lateral suture. The\nlong saphenous vein was harvested from the left leg, prior to performing above-\nknee amputation. While the left above-knee amputation was being performed, the\northopaedic surgeons carefully assessed the right lower limb and placed a tempo-\nrary fixation device traversing the right knee joint. Having obtained bony stability, with an external fixator device, the temporary intraluminal shunt was\nremoved and a definitive bypass performed using reversed left long saphenous vein graft. Formal fasciotomy was performed of the right lower leg using a standard lat-\neral and medial approach; distal pulses were confirmed in the right foot.

{"id": "16.4", "question": "A 19-year-old female was admitted to casualty following a road traffic collision. A\nwitness of the incident reported that she was driving her car at approximately\n70 km/h in wet conditions and the car skidded off the road when she turned a sharp\nbend. She collided with a tree and there were no other passengers involved. She\nwas found in her severely damaged car, drowsy and restrained by her seat belt and\nthe dashboard. The car windscreen had a \u201cbulls-eye\u201d on the driver\u2019s side and she\nhad a laceration to her forehead, which was bleeding profusely. She complained of\ndifficulty in breathing and pain in her chest, abdomen and an obviously deformed\nright leg. The paramedics attended the scene with the fire-service who helped\nextricate her form the wreckage then carefully immobilized her cervical spine.\nShe was immediately transported by helicopter to the nearest emergency\ndepartment. There she was treated by the duty surgical trauma team.\n\nPrimary examination in casualty revealed a patent airway as she was talking but\nshe was short of breath. Her trachea was deviated to the right side, the left chest\nwas hyper-resonant and devoid of breath sounds. Hemodynamically her heart rate\nwas raised (109 beats/min) and blood pressure (120/75 mmHg) was within normal\nlimits. Her abdomen was tender in the left hypochondrium and right femur had an\nopen mid-shaft fracture. Routine trauma blood investigations were requested.\nNeurologically she was drowsy and becoming increasingly confused.\n\nHer heart rate further increased (120 beats/min) and blood pressure reduced\n(110/65 mmHg). She was visibly more confused and breathing was more labored,\nwhilst her abdomen had also become distended. Hemodynamically she was a tran-\nsient responder to a bolus intravenous fluid replacement.\n\nChest imaging revealed a widened mediastinum and left tension pneumothorax.\n\nImmediate left chest needle decompression revealed a \u201cwhoosh of air\u201d and the tra-\nchea centralized. Consequently a left chest drain was inserted. The patient was becoming more confused and combative with a reducing Glasgow\nComa Scale (GCS 7), so was intubated and sedated. Initial blood results revealed a\nlow hemoglobin, however her hemodynamics had returned to values within normal\nranges with a continuous fluid infusion and whole blood transfusion.

{"id": "18.ten", "question": "A 63-year-oldman presents with a history of worsening pain in his left buttock,\nthigh and calf on walking. During the preceding 3 months, following the introduc-\ntion of a beta-blocker for newly diagnosed hypertension, the distance he could\nwalk at a \u201cnormal\u201d pace had reduced from 200 to 100 m. The pain ceased almost\nimmediately after stopping walking and appeared again after the same interval. A\nsystemic enquiry revealed recently diagnosed hypertension and life-long history of\nheavy smoking. He had never experienced cerebro-vascular or cardiac symptoms.\nClinical examination revealed sinus rhythm, full upper limb pulses, a dimin-\nished left femoral pulse and absent left popliteal and pedal pulses. The right leg\npulses were normal. Both feet appeared well perfused. No bruits were audible\nin the abdomen or groins. The abdominal aorta was not aneurismal. Ankle\npressure brachial indices were 0.74 on the left and 0.93 on the right at rest. On\ntreadmill walking for 100 m the left ankle pressure fell to 0.49.\n\nThe clinical findings were sufficient to make the diagnosis of peripheral arterial\ndisease (PAD). The patient was advised as to the risk of smoking and referred to the\nlocal smoking cessation clinic. Best medical therapy was instituted for PAD. It was\ndecided not to investigate further at this stage but to review in 3 months. After 3\nmonths the patient had successfully managed to stop smoking and was taking the\nmedication prescribed. His left leg claudication, however, had not deteriorated. He\nwas also now complaining of erectile dysfunction. As the patient was shortly to be\nretiring and was an enthusiastic hunter he was very keen for any intervention that\nmight improve his walking distance and impotence.\n\nA percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed from the left groin\nunder local anaesthesia. First a 4F sheath and pigtail catheter were used to obtain a\ndiagnostic angiogram. The angiogram was performed to visualize the left iliac disease, but also the crural arteries which had not been imaged with\nduplex. The diagnostic angiogram confirmed the duplex findings and revealed normal runoff arteries below the knee. The sheath was therefore changed to 6F and\nsystemic heparin given. A SOS OMNI\u00ae catheter was used to direct a guide wire\nacross the bifurcation. The guide wire was then steered first into the internal iliac\nand then the external iliac arteries with balloon angioplasties performed.\n\nA completion diagnostic angiogram confirmed a good result. The right femoral\nsheath was removed with manual pressure over the puncture site. The left leg pulses\nwere restored by the procedure. \n\nThe patient had post angioplasty ABPI in the left leg of 0.97. His symptoms\ncompletely resolved. He was therefore not referred for supervised exercise.\nEleven years later he returned complaining of the return of his left leg claudica-\ntion and a recent onset of erectile dysfunction. In that time period he had re-\ncommenced smoking, but less than he had done previously. He had also undergone\na coronary artery bypass graft for unstable angina. Two years following the\nbypass his angina had recurred. He continued to hunt but by now walking was\ndifficult due to occasional angina attacks, breathlessness up hills and more\nrecently pain in the left thigh and calf. On examination his left femoral pulse was\nweak, the distal pulses were absent in the left leg and a soft bruit was heard over\nthe right femoral artery.\n\nIn view of the history of peripheral arterial disease with an internal iliac artery\nstenosis arterial insufficiency was considered the most likely cause for impotence;\nthis is the most common cause of impotence in this age group. Another angiogram\nwas requested, the angiogram shows that the left internal iliac artery has re-stenosed\nand the external iliac artery has progressed to an occlusion. The common femoral\nartery reforms from collaterals and the distal run-off (neither shown) was\npreserved.\n\nThe patient insisted on being relieved from his symptoms \u201cno matter what the\nrisks\u201d. Discussion with his cardiologist revealed that the most recent coronary\nangiogram showed that two of three vein grafts had occluded and that his left ven-\ntricle function was poor (28% ejection fraction).\n\nWhich of the following is your preferred intervention?", "choices": ["Aorto-bifemoral bypass graft with revascularisation of both internal iliac\narteries.", "Left aorto-uni-iliac bypass graft with revascularisation of the left internal iliac.", "Right femoral to left femoral cross-over graft.", "Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.", "No intervention."], "correct_answer": ["D"], "explanation": "", "source": "case_studies"}

Plain X-ray films showed suspected osteomyelitis.\nDorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses were reported to be present. The\nC-reactive protein (CRP) level was 31 mg/L, leucocytes 14.8 \u00d7 109\n/L, and blood glucose 12 mmol/L.\n\nThe patient was admitted to the medical ward for treatment of his infected foot.\nDespite the administration of intravenous antibiotic treatment, later modified\naccording to the results of bacterial cultures, the infection progressed. One week\nafter admission, lateral and superficial plantar compartments were drained opera-\ntively on the lateral side of the fifth metatarsal head and between the fourth and fifth\nmetatarsal heads. Abundant pus was obtained, and the fifth metatarsal head was\nobserved to be soft. The operative wound was left open. The infection seemed to\nsubside, and the patient was discharged after a 16-day admission with oral clindamy-\ncin treatment and local wound care.\n\nDespite continuous antibiotic treatment and local treatment of the open lesion on\nthe lateral aspect of the foot, the situation worsened over the next 2 months and the\npatient was readmitted to the hospital. The patient had fever and his CRP level was\n123 mg/L. The serum creatinine was 1.6 mg/dL. An immediate wound debridement\nand amputation of the fourth toe was performed, after which the patient was admit-\nted to a vascular surgical unit (Fig. 27.1). There was a faint popliteal pulse with no\nother pulses palpated distally. Ankle brachial indices (ABIs) were 1.35 and 1.21.\nThe patient could not feel the touch of the monofilament on the plantar surface of\nthe great toe or the first and fifth metatarsal heads.\n\nThe toe pressures were 73 mmHg on the right side and 29 mmHg on the left side.\n\nA popliteopedal reconstruction was made 5 days after admission to the vascular\nsurgical unit. The great saphenous vein was used in situ with the supragenicular\npopliteal artery as an inflow vessel. Despite achieving an acceptable initial flow of\n51 mL/min, the graft thrombosed the next day and a thrombectomy and a revision\nof the graft was made. A narrow segment below the knee was replaced with a\nreversed proximal great saphenous vein under angioscopic control. A flow of\n110 mL/min was measured with transit time flowmetry.\n\nThe postoperative ABI was 0.97. Wound excision and three-ray amputation of\nthe lateral toes were performed 2 days after revascularisation. The patient was dis-\ncharged 2 weeks after admission and transferred to the community hospital. Split\nthickness skin grafting was performed there. The patient was discharged home with heel), antibiotic treatment for one more week, and local wound care. The healing of\nthe wound progressed well. Six weeks after the vascular reconstruction, the patient\nwas prescribed insoles. He also used a silicon piece correcting the position of the\nsecond toe. At 1-year follow-up, ABI was greater than 1.3/0.91 and toe pressures were\n65/55 mmHg.

A moderate degree of venectasia as a T form of\nVM along the left femoral-popliteal vein segment was also found, by WBBPS, MRI\nand duplex scan, and subsequently confirmed by separate ascending phlebography.\n\nA venectasia of the femoral vein was assessed to have a limited clinical signifi-\ncance at this stage in comparison to the ET-form lesions of the VM.\nThe lymphatic malformation (LM) component which is mixed with the ET form of\nVM, was confirmed as the ET form, giving minimum and limited clinical impact so\nthat a conservative management/observation was instituted for this LM component.\nTherefore, the ET-form lesions of VM along the knee region were selected for\nactive treatment as a priority; this was followed by the ankle and foot lesions.\nThe primary indication to initiate the treatment immediately was that these\nlesions were potentially limb-threatening (e.g., hemarthrosis) due to their proximity\nto the joints with increased vulnerability to repeated trauma, especially as a cause of\nher knee symptoms.\nThe treatment was further indicated to arrest/slow down their impact on abnor-\nmal long-bone growth.\nMultiple infiltrating ET lesions of the VM along the knee region, which is surgi-\ncally not amenable, were selected for ethanol sclerotherapy as independent therapy.\nMultisession ethanol sclerotherapy was given using the absolute ethanol in the range\nof 80 to 100% concentration in calculated dosage\u2014not exceeding 1.0 mg/kg of body\nweight as maximum dose per session\u2014by direct puncture technique under general\nanesthesia. Close cardiopulmonary monitoring during the procedure was ensured to\ncontrol and/or prevent transient pulmonary hypertension by the unavoidable spillage\nof ethanol into the systemic circulation from the lesion during treatment.\nThe symptomatic lesions along the knee with recurrent painful swelling following\nminor injuries were controlled well without complication/morbidity and substantially\nreduced the risk of intra-articular bleeding and subsequent hemarthrosis. Subsequently,\nthe ET-form VM lesions at the foot and ankle underwent surgical excision following\npreoperative multisession ethanol and N-butyl cyanoacrylic glue embolosclerother-\napy with much reduced perioperative morbidity to improve foot function.\n\nFollowing successful control of multiple VM lesions along the knee, ankle, and\nfoot with priority as a potentially limb-threatening condition, other VM lesions,\nscattered throughout the lower extremity, were also treated with absolute ethanol to\nassist further attempts to arrest the abnormal long-bone growth of the lower extrem-\nity. The abnormal long-bone growth is attributed to these VM lesions scattered\nwithin the muscular structure of the lower extremity in the extensive infiltrating type\nof ET, with significant impact on the venous circulation along the epiphyseal plate.\nIn addition to the multisession embolosclerotherapy as independent and/or adjunct\nperioperative therapy to the VM lesions, the conservative supportive measures to\nimprove and/or maintain overall venous function have been supplemented with the use\nof a graded compression above-knee stocking to prevent chronic venous insufficiency.\nThe final decision for the T-form lesion was left femoral-popliteal venectasia, but\nit was decided to defer treatment until urgent treatment of the ET form of the VM\nwas finished, but to keep it under close observation. It might eventually require\ntreatment (e.g., venorrhaphy, venous bypass) to prevent development of venous\nthromboembolism when significant venous flow/volume reduction should occur\nfollowing successful control of the ET form of VM lesions. The hemodynamic con-\nsequences of the treatment of such extensive ET-form lesions directly affect total\nvenous blood volume through the deep vein system.\nThe LM component in this patient was treated only with complex decongestive\ntherapy (CDT) in order to prevent full development of lymphedema. The infiltrating\nET form of LM detected together with the ET form of VM has been shown to put extra\nburden on the marginally normal lymph-conducting system on lymphoscinti-graphic\nevaluation. Therefore, continuous surveillance for aggressive preventive measurement\nof local to systemic cellulitis along this ET form of LM lesions is mandated.\nThis patient will continue to be managed by the multidisciplinary team of the\nCVM Clinic at regular intervals for her entire lifetime, through periodical follow-up\nassessment of the treatment results and the natural course of the untreated lesions.\n\nWhat is the first priority in the management of this patient?", "choices": ["Correction of scoliosis", "Correction of bone length discrepancy", "Control of abnormal hemodynamic status of lower extremity by vascular lesions", "Correction of gait with physical therapy and shoe adjustment", "Biopsy of the soft tissue mass"], "correct_answer": ["C"], "explanation": "", "source": "case_studies"}

She has a history of pulmo-\nnary embolism at age 17. Otherwise, she is healthy and compliant with the use\nof compression garments. The diagnosis of KTS was made soon after birth\nbecause of the port wine stains, slightly larger and longer leg and lateral vari-\ncose veins of her left leg. Physical examination shows a port wine nevus on\nthe left buttock with varicose veins and soft tissue hypertrophy along the\nanterolateral aspect of the left leg and thigh. These areas are tender to palpa-\ntion and leg elevation eases their appearance. Hyperhidrosis behind the knee\nand dorsum of the foot and in the interdigital spaces is obvious. Limb length\ndiscrepancy is 1 cm. The remainder of the exam is unremarkable.\n\nNo bruits or thrills were detected during the physical examination. If arteriovenous\nshunting is suspected further studies should be performed to characterize the anom-\naly. These include segmental limb pressures and ankle-brachial indices.\n\nThe patient underwent a complete venous duplex ultrasound with valvular compe-\ntence evaluation and magnetic resonance venography (MRV).

Since the goal\nof the AVF is to increase venous blood flow velocity, the size of the anastomosis is\nlimited to 3.5\u20134 mm in order to avoid a steal and avoid venous hypertension. A\nsmall piece of PTFE is wrapped around the saphenous AVF and looped with a 2-cm\npiece of O-Prolene, which is left in the subcutaneous tissue. This will\nserve as a guide should the AVF require closure.\nHowever, since the AVF is small, it is considered permanent and closure is not\nanticipated. To further reduce the risk of rethrombosis, a heparin infusion catheter\n(pediatric feeding tube) is placed into the proximal posterior tibial vein and brought\nout through a separate stab wound adjacent to the lower leg incision. Infusing unfrac-\ntionated heparin through this catheter to achieve a therapeutic PTT ensures a high\nconcentration of heparin in the target vein, a concentration much higher than would be\nachieved if the patient was treated with standard intravenous anticoagulation through\nan arm vein. A monofilament suture is looped around the catheter in the posterior\ntibial vein and brought out through the skin and secured with a sterile button. This is\nused to occlude the vein after 5\u20136 days when the catheter is removed following full\noral anticoagulation with warfarin. In the case of this pregnant patient, intravenous\nanticoagulation through the leg veins was maintained for 4 days, after which she was\nconverted to subcutaneous enoxaparin at 1 mg/kg every 12 h. The catheter was\nremoved and the patient discharged. The patient was maintained on subcutaneous\nenoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice a day until she delivered a healthy baby 6 weeks later.\n\nWhat is your recommendation regarding a thrombophilia evaluation?", "choices": ["It is not necessary to perform an expensive thrombophilia evaluation since this\nwas a DVT of pregnancy.", "Defer the thrombophilia evaluation until after the patient discontinues\nanticoagulation.", "Since this patient will be on indefinite anticoagulation, a thrombophilia evalua-\ntion is not necessary.", "Perform tests not affected by anticoagulation and complete the evaluation after\nanticoagulation has been discontinued."], "correct_answer": ["D"], "explanation": "", "source": "case_studies"}
