Performing an ankle-brachial index (ABI) requires an appropriately sized manual blood pressure cuff and a hand-held, continuous-wave Doppler probe. The patient should be in the supine position and allowed to rest before the examination begins. The blood pressure cuff is placed above the ankle. The Doppler probe is used to locate the dorsalis pedis (DP) or posterior tibial (PT) pulse. The pressure cuff is inflated until the Doppler signal is obliterated, and then the cuff is then slowly released. The pressure at which the Doppler signal returns is the ankle pressure. The same process is repeated for both legs (DP and PT signals) and both arms. The arm pressure must be measured with the Doppler probe and the manual blood pressure cuff. To calculate an ABI, the higher ankle pressure (DP or PT) is divided by the highest arm pressure (left or right). Note that the higher arm pressure is used to calculate the ABI for both legs. For this specific case, the highest arm pressure is 150. To calculate on the right, 165/150=1.1, on the left 120/150=0.8. A normal ABI is 0.9 to 1.2. Patients with claudication usually have an ABI ranging from 0.5 to 0.9, and those with ischemic rest pain or tissue loss usually have an ABI less than 0.5.

This patient requires removal of the affected toes. However, if only the toes are removed, the remaining toes are subject to ulcer formation and or infection. If 3 or more toes are removed, the stability of the foot can be compromised and thus the correct amputation for him is a transmetatarsal amputation (TMA). He has adequate distal perfusion with palpable pedal pulses, and therefore, he will likely be able to heal from the amputation. A TMA will remove infected tissue and will provide him with the greatest amputation stump length. A below-knee amputation (BKA), through-knee amputation (TKA), and above-knee amputation (AKA) are too extreme for the burden of foot infection.

Smoking contributes to worsening peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Peripheral arterial disease results when the arteries narrow due to plaque accumulation which prevents or decreases the amount of oxygen-rich blood reaching your legs. The chemicals in tobacco products increase the rate of plaque formation in arterial walls thereby narrowing the arterial lumen. Smoking also constricts blood vessels and causes blood to clot, ultimately putting PAD patients at a higher risk of further complications such as heart attacks, limb amputations, and death.

Because of its location in the deep compartments of the lower leg, the peroneal artery becomes the most likely artery to remain patent in diabetic patients with vascular disease. Therefore, when performing preoperative imaging to plan an infrapopliteal bypass, a more common target site for anastomosis is the peroneal artery. It is important to remember that it is necessary for the peroneal artery to have patency to the anterior or posterior tibial artery to perfuse the entire foot. Choice B is incorrect because this is more of a presentation in a patient with acute occlusion of only the popliteal artery, as in a posterior knee dislocation. Patients with vascular disease tend to have more distal vessels affected before proximal. Choice A is incorrect because the geniculate arteries themselves are collaterals.

An arterial embolism refers to an acute event where thrombogenic material lodges in an arterial tree, usually at a branching point. Various etiologies exist, including septic and cardiogenic sources. In a patient with atrial fibrillation, a laminated thrombus with a cardiac origin is likely the cause of his embolus. As previously mentioned, when an embolus occurs, it often becomes lodged at an arterial bifurcation, usually at a narrowed peripheral location where the arterial caliber changes. One of the more common locations for obstruction is the common femoral artery at the bifurcation of the superficial femoral artery and profunda femoris, which can lead to an acute arterial cutoff sign as seen in the computed tomography angiogram described in this case. Patients presenting with acute limb ischemia classically present with one or more of the six Ps: pulselessness, pallor, pain, paresthesia, paralysis, and poikilothermia. The man has several of these findings, making the diagnosis of an acute embolic event reasonable. The findings of buttock claudication, erectile dysfunction, and decreased femoral pulses are a classic presentation of Leriche syndrome, which is caused by chronic aortoiliac occlusive disease. Bilateral decreased foot sensation and pain is more likely seen in a patient with diabetic neuropathy and venous stasis. Reproducible calf pain that improves with rest and has decreased signals is consistent with chronic peripheral arterial disease and claudication. Lastly, a patient with loss of sensation, decreased motor function, and mottling of the skin but with palpable femoral pulses has a high likelihood of having irreversible, Rutherford III acute limb ischemia, commonly due to infrageniculate thrombosis.", "source": "apdvs"}

{"question": "Which of the following can differentiate native arterial or graft thrombosis from embolic occlusion?", "choices": ["The presence of palpable pulses in the contralateral extremity", "A history of cardiac arrhythmias", "The location of the occlusion", "The degree of profound ischemia in the affected extremity", "All of the above"], "correct_answer": ["E"], "explanation": "", "source": "case_studies"}
{"question": "A 72-year-old female presents with a 2-week history of abdominal/back pain and lower extremity fatigue. She was evaluated by her physician and diagnosed with lumbosacral neuritis. Initial treatment involved lumbar corticosteroid injections. Secondary to sudden onset lower extremity weakness she presented to the emergency department. Her past history included diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. In the past month, she had undergone heart catheterization which was significant for multi-vessel coronary artery disease. She denied any prior surgeries.\nOn examination, her pulse is 75 bpm, and blood pressure is 175/60. Heart sounds reveal a regular rhythm. The abdomen is soft and nontender. She has absent pulses and diminished strength in both lower extremities. Both feet are insensate. There are venous Doppler signals in the feet, but no arterial signals. Creatinine on arrival was 0.9 mg/dL, and white blood cell count was 23,000. Pre-operative CTA demonstrates infrarenal aortic occlusion with bilateral renal infarcts.\nWhat is the SVS/ISCVS category of limb ischemia in this patient?", "choices": ["Category I", "Category II a", "Category II b", "Category III"], "correct_answer": ["C"], "explanation": "This patient has Category IIb limb ischemia characterized by lack of\ndistal arterial signals in the foot, sensory loss, and motor weakness.", "source": "case_studies"}
{"question": "What sign differentiates SVS/ISCVS Category IIa from IIb ischemia?", "choices": ["Pulselessness", "Sensory loss", "Motor loss", "Loss of venous doppler signals"], "correct_answer": ["C"], "explanation": "Motor loss separates Category IIa from IIb ischemia and determines the urgency on which\nto proceed to revascularization.", "source": "case_studies"}
{"question": "Which of the following describes the sequence of events of acute embolism?", "choices": ["Pulselessness, pain, pallor, paresthesia, paralysis", "Paralysis, pain, paresthesia, pulselessness, pallor", "Pulselessness, pain, pallor, paralysis, paresthesia"], "correct_answer": ["A"], "explanation": "", "source": "case_studies"}
