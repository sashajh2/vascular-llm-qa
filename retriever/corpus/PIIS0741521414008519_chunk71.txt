irritating, nontoxic solution, performed with a
minimum of chemical or mechanical trauma. [GRADE 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]

Although there is little evidence that the routine use of
a wound cleanser results in improvement of VLU outcomes measures, most patients with VLUs present with signiﬁcant wound exudate and other debris in and around the
wound area that must be cleansed routinely before dressing
application. Numerous cleansing solutions have been
described in this role with reasonable success.218,219 It appears that the main selection factor is to avoid routine use
of a cleanser that would result in toxicity to the viable tissue
in the wound bed.220

Guideline 4.2: Débridement
We recommend that venous leg ulcers receive thorough débridement at their initial evaluation to remove
obvious necrotic tissue, excessive bacterial burden, and
cellular burden of dead and senescent cells. [GRADE 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B] We suggest that additional maintenance débridement be performed to
maintain the appearance and readiness of the wound
bed for healing. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE B] We suggest that the health care provider choose
