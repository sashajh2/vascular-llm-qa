The relative costs of CAS and CEA will clearly impact
hospital proﬁtability. An analysis of the National Inpatient
Sample from 2001 through 2008 identiﬁed 181,200 CEA
and 12,485 CAS procedures. Median costs for uncomplicated CEA and CAS cases were $1466 and $3272 higher
than the average Medicare reimbursement, respectively.
Median costs for patients with intermediate levels of comorbid conditions for CEA and CAS cases were $2847
and $4926 higher than Medicare reimbursements,
respectively. For patients with the highest levels of comorbid conditions, the median costs for CEA and CAS
were $23,399 and $21,750 higher than Medicare reimbursements, respectively.666 These ﬁndings were supported by a single institution study of 169 patients
undergoing CEA and 132 patients undergoing CAS. Hospital reimbursement was 16% higher for CAS compared
with CEA ($12,000 6 $7372 vs $10,160 6 6840; P ¼ .02).
However, hospital net revenue was 29% higher ($3487
vs $2603) among patients undergoing CEA compared
with CAS owing to much higher CAS supply costs.667
Several investigators have reported long-term cost efﬁcacy analyses of CAS and CEA. In one report, outcomes of
447 patients undergoing CEA in a single institution were
compared with CAS outcomes in the literature. A Markov
decision model was constructed that included procedural costs and long-term cost of morbidities such as
stroke. Procedural costs of CEA and CAS were $7871
and $10,133, respectively. Assuming a procedural stroke
rate of 0.9% for CEA and 5.0% for CAS, and a 30-day mortality rate of 0% for CEA and 1.2% for CAS, CEA was found
to be associated with a lifetime saving of $7017 per patient and an increase in quality-adjusted life years saved
of 0.16.
