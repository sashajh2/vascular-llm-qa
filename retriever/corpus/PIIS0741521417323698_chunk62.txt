 a 42% reduction
in AAA-related mortality and a small reduction in allcause mortality. It was estimated that 216 men needed
to be invited to screening to save one death during 13
years. Of those aneurysms that did rupture, roughly half
had an initial baseline diameter of 2.5 to 2.9 cm at initial
screening.251
Screening for AAA in women is more controversial.
Because few women were included in these trials, a
decrease in AAA-related mortality or incidence of
rupture could not be identiﬁed.5 Although AAA prevalence is lower in women, the rate of rupture and overall
life expectancy are higher, which suggest that screening
may be more cost-effective in women.252
In 2005, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF) recommended a one-time screening by
abdominal ultrasound for men aged 65 to 75 years
with a history of smoking.253 In 2014, the USPSTF
updated their 2005 recommendations to include onetime ultrasound screening for men aged 65 to 75 years
who have ever smoked (grade B) and selective screening
of 65- to 75-year-old men who have never smoked (grade
C). Screening was not recommended for women aged 65
to 75 years who have never smoked (grade D), and evidence was insufﬁcient to recommend for or against
screening in women aged 65 to 75 years who had a
smoking history.254 The USPSTF recommendations are
based on the assumption that 6% to 7% of men with a
smoking history in the 65- to 75-year age group will
have an AAA. In the absence of a smoking history, the
prevalence drops to 2%. The prevalence of AAA is 0.8%
in a similar age group of women who have a past history
of smoking, but for women who are current smokers, the
prevalence is 2%. In women who have never smoked,
AAA prevalence is <0.60%.254
