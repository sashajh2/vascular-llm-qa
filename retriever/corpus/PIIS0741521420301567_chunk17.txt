AA and PDAA, we recommend computed tomography angiography (CTA) as the
diagnostic tool of choice. Level of Recommendation:
Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
1.2: In patients in whom celiac stenosis is suspected, we
suggest further workup with duplex ultrasound to elucidate whether the stenosis is hemodynamically signiﬁcant. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
1.3: In patients with high radiation exposure risks or
renal insufﬁciency, we suggest non-contrast-enhanced
magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for diagnosis.
Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of
Evidence: C (Low).
Technical remark: Non-contrast-enhanced MRA is best
suited to children and women of childbearing potential
or those who have contraindications to CTA or MRA
contrast materials (ie, pregnancy, renal insufﬁciency, or
gadolinium contrast material allergy).
2.1: In patients with noncomplicated GDAA and PDAA
of acceptable operative risk, we recommend treatment
no matter the size of the aneurysm because of the risk
of rupture. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
3.1: In patients with intact and ruptured aneurysms, we
recommend coil embolization as the treatment of
choice. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
3.2: In patients in whom coil embolization is not
feasible, we suggest covered stenting or stent-assisted
coil embolization as a treatment option in select cases
of GDAA and PDAA. Level of Recommendation: Grade
2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
3.3: In patients with appropriate anatomy, we suggest
transcatheter embolization with liquid embolic agents
as a treatment option for both GDAA and PDAA. Level
of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
3.4: In patients with suitable anatomy, we suggest ﬂowdiverting, multilayered stents as a treatment option for
GDAA and PDAA, although these
