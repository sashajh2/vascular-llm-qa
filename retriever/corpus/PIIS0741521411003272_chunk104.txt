 telangiectasia. The proximal part of the
limb is treated first and the distal part second. Using loupes
for magnification and transillumination (Veinlite, TransLite, Sugar Land, Tex; VeinViewer, Luminetx, Memphis,
Tenn) helps intraluminal injection and avoids extravasation
of the drug. The injection maximum of 1.0 mL of the
chemical to one site is recommended, with not more than
10 to 20 injections performed per session. Severe pain
during injection may signal extravasation, and further injection should be avoided.29 Gauze pads are placed on the
injection sites, and the patient is instructed to wear 30 to 40
mm Hg graduated compression stockings for 1 to 3 days
after treatment of telangiectasia and reticular veins and at
least 1 week after treatment of varicose and perforating
veins.
Foam sclerotherapy. Foam sclerotherapy of the saphenous vein is the least invasive of the endovenous ablation techniques. The European Consensus Meetings on
Foam Sclerotherapy308,309 reported that foam was an effective, safe, and minimally invasive endovenous treatment
for varicose veins with a low rate of complications.
The most popular technique used today was developed
by Tessari et al312 using a three-way stopcock connected
with two syringes. Experts recommend a ratio of 1 part
solution of STS or polidocanol to 4 or 5 parts of air.313
Mixing the drug with air using the two syringes and push-

ing the mixture from one syringe into the other 20 times
results in an approximate bubble size of ⬍100 ␮m.
Coleridge-Smith306 advises to cannulate the veins in
supine patients and then elevate the limb 30° to inject the
foam. Ultrasonography is used to monitor the movement
of foam in the veins. The saphenous trunk is injected first,
followed by varicose and perforating veins if indicated. A
maximum of 20 mL of foam is injected during one session.
Bergan313 recommends elevation of the limb for
