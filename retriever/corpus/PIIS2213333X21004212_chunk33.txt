common complication of CAC is superﬁcial phlebitis,
which is usually mild and responds well to nonsteroidal
anti-inﬂammatory treatment.85 All outcomes and

Small saphenous vein and anterior accessory saphenous vein studies
We included one retrospective cohort99 that compared
RFA intervention with CAC intervention, reported on 335
patients (mean age, 57 years; 78% women) with CEAP
class C2 to C5. Thirty-one patients received treatment
for small saphenous vein (SSV), 14 received treatment
for anterior accessory saphenous vein, and most of the
cohort received treatment for GSV.
SSV outcomes. When RFA was compared with CAC,
there were no signiﬁcant differences for outcomes such
as anatomic closure at 1 month (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.881.12; phlebitis, RR, 3.60; 95% CI, 0.16-82.05; and paresthesia,
RR, 3.60; 95% CI, 0.16-82.05).
Anterior accessory saphenous vein outcomes. When
RFA was compared with CAC, there were no signiﬁcant
differences for outcomes such as anatomic closure at
1 month, RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.79-1.32; phlebitis, RR, 3.89;
95% CI, 0.22-68.67; and paresthesia, RR, 3.89; 95% CI,
0.22-68.67).

Key Question 4. Incompetent perforators ablation vs no
ablation
We included two RCTs.112,113 The two RCTs had an intermediate risk of bias. The studies reported on 141 patients
