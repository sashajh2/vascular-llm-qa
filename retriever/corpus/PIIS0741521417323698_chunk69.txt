connects estimates from the same study, and circles have diameters that represent amount of information.

Recommendations for imaging of the symptomatic
patient. In patients with abdominal or back pain, ultrasound imaging is recommended to determine whether
an AAA is present and to evaluate for the presence of
other causes of abdominal or back pain. If an aneurysm
is detected, the patient should have CT aortography
with timed intravenous injection of contrast material, if
it is not contraindicated, to exclude rupture and to facilitate operative planning. A patient presenting with a
large AAA and back or abdominal pain should be
referred for treatment as soon as an aneurysm is recognized, regardless of evidence for rupture or symptom
evolution or whether a CT scan has been completed.
If hemodynamic compromise is present or evolves
during the process of evaluation, further imaging studies
should be abandoned as care is escalated.
We recommend a CT scan to evaluate patients thought to
have AAA presenting with recent-onset abdominal or back
pain, particularly in the presence of a pulsatile epigastric
mass or signiÔ¨Åcant risk factors for AAA.
