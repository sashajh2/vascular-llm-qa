<0.01) and from 4.8 to 0.6 in the surgery group (P <0.001) (Sell et al. 2014a). Therefore,
the Society for Vascular Surgery recommends against a three-month trial of conservative
therapy prior to intervention for patients with C2 and C3 disease (Gloviczki et al. 2024a).
 In the landmark ESCHAR trial, patients with C5-C6 disease randomized to HL&S and
compression as compared to compression alone were found to have no significant differences in ulcer healing time (89% for the compression group and 93% for the compression
plus surgery group at three years) but significantly lower rates of ulcer recurrence (56%
for the compression group and 31% for the compression plus surgery group at 4 years, P
< 0.01).

Endovenous Treatment of Saphenous Refux
 Both EVLA and RFA are considered first-line therapies for the treatment of symptomatic
saphenous refux and are preferred over open surgery due to decreased postoperative
morbidity and reduced convalescence time [Gloviczki et al. (2024a)](Sidawy and Perler
2023e).
 A meta-analysis of 64 studies comparing RFA, EVLA, foam therapy, or surgery for the
treatment of truncal veins demonstrated higher success rates for RFA and EVLA (84%
and 94%) as compared to surgery and foam sclerotherapy (78% and 77%) after 3 years
(Nijsten et al. 2009).
 Patients with varicosities, enlarged reticular veins, or telangiectasias in addition to saphenous refux benefit from simultaneous treatment with EVLA/RFA and ambulatory phlebectomy as opposed to staged treatment with improvement in early disease severity and
QoL scores (Aherne et al. 2020a).
 Duplex ultrasound follow-up examination is recommended between 3-7 days following the
procedure to assess for successful ablation as well as endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (extension of proximal thrombus into deep system) (Sidawy and Perler 2023e). EHIT
may be treated with anticoagulants
