7.2%, respectively. Duplex ultrasonography identified 185
limbs that had one of the following modes of anatomic
failure:
Type I failure (nonocclusion): The treated vein failed to
occlude initially and never occluded during the follow-up
(12.4%).
Type II failure (recanalization): The vein occluded after
treatment but recanalized, partly or completely, at a later
time (69.7%).
Type III failure (groin reflux): The vein trunk occluded, but reflux was detected at the groin region, often
involving an accessory vein (17.8%).
Relief from symptoms (pain, fatigue, and edema) was
noted in most patients; 70% to 80% of those with anatomic
failure remained asymptomatic compared with 85% to 94%
of those with anatomic success. Type II and type III failures
were risk factors for varicose vein recurrence. In addition,
catheter pullback speed and body mass index were the two
risk factors associated with anatomic failures.

Early results of the new-generation RF catheter were
reported by Proebstle et al.260 A prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter study treated 252 GSVs, with an occlusion rate at 6 months of 99.6%. Return to normal daily
activities took place on the same day in more than half the
patients, with an average time of 1.0 days (standard deviation, 1.9; median, 0 days; range, 0-17 days).
Complications. Serious complications from RFA, such
as DVT or thermal skin injury, were not observed in a
multicenter, nonrandomized study of RFA using the newgeneration RF catheter system.260 Paresthesia occurred in
3.2%, thrombophlebitis in 0.8%, ecchymosis along the
course of the GSV in 6.3%, and skin pigmentation in 2%.
Lawrence et al262 reported a 2.6% rate of thrombus extension into the femoral veins after 500 RF procedures.
