iphoid and umbilicus, especially in thin patients.
Palpation
 The aorta bifurcates at the level of the umbilicus. To palpate the aorta, press your
fingers on both sides of the midline between the umbilicus and the xiphoid. To help
relax the abdomen, ask the patient to bend their knees, fex their hips, and relax their
abdominal muscle. The goal is not only to feel the aortic pulse but also to estimate the
size of the aorta. In people without aortic aneurysms, a palpable aorta is often the size
of the patientâ€™s thumb. A tender, enlarged, pulsatile abdominal mass may represent a
symptomatic aortic aneurysm or infammatory aneurysm.
 The sensitivity of palpation to detect an abdominal aortic aneurysm is low (29%) for small
(3.0- 4cm) aneurysms. Moreover, even large aneurysms > 5 cm may not be detected on
physical exam (sensitivity of 76%). False positives can be found in elderly patients
who have tortuous anterior placed aorta. It is important to mention that palpation
of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is safe and has never been reported to precipitate
aortic rupture. When an aortic aneurysm is identified, A complete peripheral arterial
examination should be performed looking for evidence of distal embolization, ischemia
or associated peripheral artery aneurysms (femoral, popliteal).
 The iliac arteries lie deep in the pelvis and are usually not palpable, even if aneurysmal.
Auscultation
 Cardiac auscultation is performed to assess rate and rhythm with special attention to
the presence of any arrhythmias, gallops, and murmurs.
 Bruits in the abdomen are associated with arterial stenosis. The origin of the bruit could
be renal, mesenteric, or aortoiliac.

Lower Extremity Exam:
Inspection
 Pallor, cyanosis, and poor capillary refill are signs of chronic limb ischemia. Muscle
atrophy, hair loss, and thick toenails may also be present.
 Dependent rubor and pallor with elevation indicate advanced peripheral occlusive
