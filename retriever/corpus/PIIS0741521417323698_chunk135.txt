Type III endoleak. A type III endoleak occurs when
there is incomplete seal between components or
component separation and less frequently is due to fabric erosion. The aneurysm sac becomes repressurized
with an increased risk of rupture. All type III endoleaks
should be treated. When the endoleak is present at the
contralateral gate or between an iliac limb and an iliac
extension, treatment entails bridging the gap with an
appropriately sized limb.640,641
Type IV endoleak. A type IV endoleak is due to fabric
porosity, which may be present at the time of repair. All
type IV endoleaks seal spontaneously and do not require
treatment.
Endotension. Endotension is deﬁned as sac enlargement
without a discernible endoleak. It may be caused by blood
ﬂow that is undetectable at the limits of the imaging modality, pressure transmission through fabric,672,673 or accumulation of a serous ultraﬁltrate across a microporous
fabric.635 Endotension is less common with the newer
generation grafts. Management should be individualized
and may entail observation, relining of low-porosity
endografts, or rarely explantation and conversion to open
repair.

We recommend treatment of type I endoleaks.

B (Moderate)

We suggest treatment of type II endoleaks associated with
aneurysm expansion.
