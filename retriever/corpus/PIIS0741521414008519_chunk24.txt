ulatory setting, the direct cost of this care is related
to (1) technical (facility) costs and professional reimbursement (physicians); (2) labor costs (nurses and paramedical personnel) for wound care treatments, which are
the major driver of costs; and (3) medications as well as
specialized wound dressings and compression garments. A
key determinant of the costs of treating VLU is the effectiveness of treatmentdnot only how rapidly the ulcer heals,
but also whether the ulcer recurs. For example, a more
expensive wound dressing may have an economic advantage for overall care because of more rapid healing of the
VLU with less duration of product use and attendant labor
costs.
To determine the actual costs of treating VLUs during
a 1-year period, a recent study examined a cohort of 84 patients with nonhealing VLUs (CEAP C6) who presented
to a wound clinic. All patients were treated in a wound
center by ﬁve vascular surgeons with a minimum followup of 6 months (median, 368 days; 336-483).17 Actual
costs (not charges) were obtained for outpatient and inpatient facility, visiting nurse services, and physician practice
group to yield true cost. The proportion and time to complete healing of VLU were determined to calculate time to
healing as well as ulcer-free intervals. Cost/ulcer-free days
and cost to complete healing for the entire follow-up
period were carried out with univariate analysis of factors
affecting cost. The mean total cost of treating VLU during
this follow-up period was $15,732. A total of 50 patients
(60%) healed their VLU without recurrence in a mean
time of 122 days (6-379 days) at a mean cost of
$10,563 ($430-$50,967). Signiﬁcant contributing factors
were outpatient facility fees ($10,332) and visiting nurse
services ($11,365) related to extended treatment of the
open VLU. Patients who failed to heal their ulcer during
the duration of this study (20%) had a threefold increase
in their costs ($33,907). Those patients who had recurrence of their
