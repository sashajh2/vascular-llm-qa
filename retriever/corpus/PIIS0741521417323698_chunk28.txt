Question/comparison

Findings (quality of evidence)

Twine, 201324

Retroperitoneal vs transperitoneal
approach to the infrarenal abdominal
aorta

Jackson, 201425

Totally percutaneous vs standard femoral
artery access for elective bifurcated
abdominal EVAR

BaniHani, 201126

Interventions for preventing venous
thromboembolism after abdominal
aortic surgery

Twine, 201127

Effects of statins on AAA

d

Retroperitoneal approach is associated with lower
rates of postoperative ileus and pneumonia
(moderate)

d

One small, highly imprecise study (low)

The body of direct evidence is insufﬁcient (two small
studies with methodologic limitations)
d Extrapolation from indirect evidence is required

Bergqvist, 201128

Pharmacologic interventions to attenuate
the expansion of AAA

Pieper, 201329

Surgical outcomes and hospital volume

Reduction in mortality (moderate)
No change in expansion (low)

d

No consistent pattern of pharmacologic inﬂuence on
expansion rate (low)

d

Lower mortality for elective and ruptured AAA repair
in high-volume hospitals (low)

d

Magnetic resonance imaging was more sensitive for
type II endoleaks (moderate)

Postoperative surveillance
Habets, 201330

Magnetic resonance imaging vs CTA
for the detection of endoleaks after
EVAR for AAA

Karthikesalingam,
201231

Diagnostic accuracy of DUS and
contrast-enhanced ultrasound for
types I and III endoleak

Antoniou, 201532

Late rupture of AAA after EVAR

Both DUS and contrast-enhanced ultrasound were
highly speciﬁc for types I and III endoleaks
(moderate)
d Sensitivity estimates were likely similar but less
