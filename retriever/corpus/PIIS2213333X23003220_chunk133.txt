 studies reported
improvement in symptoms.

Probably yes

How substantial are the
undesirable anticipated
effects?

Reported side effects of discomfort, appearance, and application
difﬁculty. The beneﬁts of stockings were offset by highly variable
reports of compliance, presumably due to the most common side
effects of itching and irritation.

Probably yes

Do the desirable effects
outweigh the undesirable
effects?

Probably

Probably yes

What is the overall certainty of
the evidence of effects?

Low with signiﬁcant heterogeneity of data

Low

How large are the resource
requirements associated
with the intervention?

No available data

Unknown

How large is the incremental
cost relative to the net
beneﬁt?

No available data

Unknown

What would be the effect on
health inequalities?

None

None

Is the opinion acceptable to
key stakeholders?

No data available

Probably yes

Is the opinion feasible to
implement?

Yes

Yes

GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
10.1.2. For patients with varicose veins (CEAP
class C2) who have signiﬁcant, symptomatic axial
reﬂux of the AAGSV or PAGSV, we suggest against
treatment
of
incompetent
perforating
veins
concomitant with initial ablation of the superﬁcial
truncal veins.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
For Rationale and Evidence supporting Guidelines 10.1.1
and 10.1.2, please see Part I of the varicose vein
guidelines.8
10.2. For patients with incompetent pathologic perforators associated with symptomatic residual, recurrent, and rarely primary varicosities, without
associated saphenous incompetence, either open or
endovascular techniques can be used to treat the
perforator veins.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Since IPVs are potential sources of recurrence, occlusion of relevant IPVs is indicated in C2 patients who have symptomatic recurrent or residual
varicose veins after previous superﬁcial truncal ablation
