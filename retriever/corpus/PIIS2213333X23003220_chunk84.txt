included RFA, EVLA, n-butyl cyanoacrylate and sclerotherapy.29 The MARADONA trial, a multicenter randomized study that compared MOCA to RFA, did not ﬁnd a
signiﬁcant difference in the incidence of skin burn or
saphenous neuralgia between the two techniques at
30 days.157
5.2.7. For patients with large (>10 mm), nonaneurysmal saphenous veins, thermal ablation with EVLA
or RFA should be performed over nonthermal
techniques.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. While there are many techniques to perform
venous ablation and they provide favorable outcomes in
the setting of large diameter (>10 mm) veins, thermal ablations have superiority over other treatments.
Evidence. Hamann et al examined the safety and
effectiveness of endovenous thermal ablation in 11

limbs with a large GSV, but < 2 cm in size close to
the junction (Table XIV).158 No DVT or EHIT was noted,
and truncal obliteration was 80% at 1 year. Atasoy
reviewed 44 consecutive patients with large GSVs, with
a mean diameter of 16.95 mm (range, 15-26 mm) and
found a 100% occlusion rate at 1 year after treatment.
All patients had clinical improvement and improved
QOL scores.159 Calcagno et al160 found no difference in
occlusion rates of 246 limbs with saphenous vein
diameter #12 mm diameter (mean, 8 6 2 mm) and of
96 with vein >12 mm (mean, 17 6 4 mm) when treated
with RFA. Fernandez et al treated 183 patients with a
GSV diameter <12 mm and 74 with a GSV diameter
$12 mm. There was signiﬁcant improvement in pain
and QOL in both groups, with no difference in occlusion rates or adverse effects at 1, 6, and 12 months.161
Borsuk and Fokin conducted a prospective study of
261 EVLA procedures of the
