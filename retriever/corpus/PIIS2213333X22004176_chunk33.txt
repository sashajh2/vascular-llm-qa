 that “there is
insufﬁcient high-certainty evidence to determine
whether or not compression stockings are effective as
the sole and initial treatment of varicose veins in people
without healed or active venous ulceration, or whether
any type of stocking is superior to any other type.”79
The clinical outcomes at 2 years after conservative treatment (lifestyle modiﬁcations and compression stockings)
vs surgery (high ligation and saphenous stripping) were
reported by Michaels et al80 in the randomized REACTIVE (randomised clinical trial, observational study and
assessment of cost-effectiveness of the treatment of varicose veins) trial of 246 patients with varicose veins. At
2 years, the patients who had undergone surgery to
ablate the superﬁcial varicose veins had had signiﬁcant
QoL beneﬁt based on the SF-6D (short-form six domains)

and the EQ-5D scores.80 The improvement in symptoms
and venous anatomy was also signiﬁcant. In the U.K.
study reported by Ratcliffe et al,81 surgical treatment of
varicose veins offered a modest health beneﬁt for relatively little additional National Health Service cost relative to conservative treatment.
An additional randomized trial of 153 patients randomized to surgery or compression stockings found surgery
to be associated with signiﬁcant decreases in the VCSS
and health-related QoL compared with compression
therapy.82 Others have also found that most patients
will beneﬁt from surgery even after compression therapy
has failed.83 In addition, in the United Kingdom, the conservative management of varicose veins was not found to
be cost-effective.84,85 The consistency of the data supports a strong recommendation for surgical intervention
instead of compressions stockings alone for those who
are candidates for surgery and are willing to undergo
an intervention to treat symptomatic incompetent superﬁcial truncal veins and varicose tributaries. No evidence is available to support the beneﬁt of a trial of
3 months of compression therapy before offering surgical
or endovenous intervention for most patients.
Thus, the panel adopted the previous SVS/AVF guidelines20 and recommends intervention over compression
stocking alone for those who are candidates for a procedure and willing to undergo an intervention to treat
symptomatic
