 and dissection of the
intimal-medial wall of the often postphlebitic vein to form a
monocuspid or bicuspid valve, with proper sutures placed to
form a functioning valve. Regarding the ﬁrst three techniques,
small case series have been reported, but they lack corroborative series from other surgeons. Raju and Hardy reported ﬁve
of seven patients to have healed recalcitrant VLUs within 4
months without recurrence during a 15- to 24-month observation period by use of the ﬁrst technique.383 Great saphenous
vein invagination has been reported in a single series, with 19
of 20 repairs remaining patent and competent at 10 months of
follow-up, with all VLUs healing within 6 months and no recurrences observed.407,408 The valve made of the anterior vein
wall with synthetic patch repair has reported excellent clinical
results (80% or better) for the ﬁrst year, but the number of
cases reported is small.
Creation of monocuspid or bicuspid valves from the
endoluminal lining of the post-thrombotic or even the primary diseased vein wall (neovalve) has been reported from
a single site. It has undergone modiﬁcations over the years,
and recent reports show 85% patency/competency rate
with about 85% healed and ulcer-free recurrence rate at a
mean of 28 months. All valves were patent. There was a
95% ulcer healing rate and two recurrent ulcers.409,410
These techniques are performed in cases that are highly
selected and have no other known valvular restorative potential. The procedures must be considered technically
challenging and still in need of corroborative data before
wider dissemination. Their use should be limited to experienced venous reconstructive surgeons in patients without
other viable options.
