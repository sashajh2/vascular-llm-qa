,87,140,169,184,185 This remains a conservative option for rupture, in which case exploratory laparotomy facilitates the evacuation of hematoma,
deﬁnitive aneurysm treatment, and bowel assessment
for viability. Enterectomy or colectomy may be
required as intramural aneurysms and those associated
with bowel necrosis require resection of the involved
bowel at the time of aneurysm exclusion. Robust collateralization often permits simple aneurysm ligation
or resection without reconstruction. However, special
consideration is required in patients with a previous
colectomy as the collateral network might be
incomplete.

3.1

We suggest open surgical ligation or aneurysm excision for cases of jejunal, ileal, and
colic artery aneurysms when laparotomy is being considered for hematoma
evacuation or bowel assessment for viability.

3.2

We suggest endovascular embolization for cases of jejunal, ileal, and colic artery
aneurysm.

We suggest medical treatment of nonruptured, asymptomatic ileal, jejunal, and colic
artery aneurysms associated with polyarteritis nodosa.

Transcatheter embolization with coils, Onyx, and glue (nbutyl cyanoacrylate) has been increasingly used, especially for cases of acute rupture and gastrointestinal
bleeding.1,7,111,186-188 Endovascular interventions offer precise localization of the aneurysm, assessment of collateral
ﬂow, lower risk for patients who are not good operative
candidates, easier approach to aneurysms for which surgical exposure would be difﬁcult, and decreased length of
stay.1,111 These beneﬁts are balanced with a risk of intestinal
