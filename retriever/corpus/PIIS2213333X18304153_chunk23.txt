-term standard
bandaging after sclerotherapy was also addressed in
the Cochrane review.53 The duration of compression
(short vs standard time) after sclerotherapy was the
subject of four randomized trials. The following
assessed outcomes favored short-term application of
bandages: cosmetic and symptomatic improvement54;
recurrent varicose veins55,56; complications such as
phlebitis, staining, pain, blistering, and ulceration33;
and discomfort, slipping, foot swelling, and bandage
intolerance.33,56
Two different studies addressed the effectiveness of
compression stockings and their duration for sclerotherapy treating reticular veins and telangiectasia in
similar patients. Weiss et al34 studied 40 patients, 30
of whom received compression therapy and 10 of
whom did not. The compression group consisted of 3
subgroups of 10 patients each, receiving compression
for 3 days, 1 week, or 3 weeks. The patients were evaluated at 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and
24 weeks for the degree of improvement and side
effects. All three compression subgroups showed
signiﬁcantly greater improvement at 6 weeks
compared with controls. Patients treated with
compression for 3 days and 1 week showed better
improvement than the control patients, but patients
treated for 3 weeks of continuous compression had
the most improvement. In terms of side effects, the
1-week and 3-week compression groups experienced
the least amount of hyperpigmentation after sclerotherapy.34 In another study by Kern et al,44 100 female
patients seeking treatment for telangiectasia and
reticular veins were randomized to wear medical
compression stockings (23-32 mm Hg) daily for 3 weeks
vs no compression after a single session of liquid
sclerotherapy. The outcomes were compared on the
basis of a patient satisfaction analysis and a quantitative evaluation of photographs taken before the procedure and at a mean of 52 days after sclerotherapy
by two blinded expert reviewers. Wearing compression
stockings of 23 to 32 mm Hg for 3 weeks enhanced
the efﬁcacy of sclerotherapy by improving vessel
