 major vascular and diabetes associations, these
individuals should be considered as having a very high
cardiovascular risk and should be treated as such. On
the other hand, they usually have, in addition to peripheral neuropathy, other diabetes related complications
as well as several co-morbidities, resulting in a high

burden of diseases and multiple medications.30 Many
affected persons are elderly, frail, and are living in vulnerable socio-economic circumstances with a low quality of
life.131,132 It is therefore essential that cardiovascular risk
factor management in these people should be individualised, tailored, and should be part of a shared decision
making process, taking life expectancy, diabetes related
complications and co-morbidities, expected beneﬁt,
treatment burden, drug interactions, and undesirable
treatment effects into account. This care should be provided by healthcare worker(s) with sufﬁcient expertise
in treating cardiovascular risk factors and glycaemia,
preferably by person(s) who are part of the multidisciplinary team for diabetes related foot care.
Glycaemic goals. As stated in the ADA and ESC-EASD
guidelines, near normal glycaemia with HbA1c level
below 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) will decrease microvascular
complications.18,22 Tighter glucose control initiated early
in the course of diabetes in younger individuals leads to a
reduction in macrovascular complications, i.e., cardiovascular outcomes, over a 20 year timescale. Such
glucose control can have beneﬁcial effects on microvascular complications in a shorter period of time. However,
when blood glucose lowering agents are used that have
the risk of severe hypoglycaemia, this can increase the
risk of cardiovascular events and death, as detailed in the
ADA and ESC-EASD guidelines.18,129 As many people with
a DFU and PAD also have atherosclerotic disease in other
vascular beds, tight glucose control can be harmful. The
risk of hypoglycaemia is markedly lower when people are
only treated with metformin, a sodium glucose
cotransporter-2 inhibitor or a glucagon like peptide 1
receptor agonist. Tight glucose control is often not indicated in people with PAD and a DFU due to the risk of
hyp
