therapy.97 Because of the dynamic nature of IMH and its
association with AD (AD in evolution), close observation
and hypertension control with follow-up imaging are
warranted.
Recommendation 13: Because of the dynamic nature
of isolated IMH and its known association with AD, we
recommend close observation and hypertension control
with follow-up imaging as the initial management of patients with asymptomatic IMH. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)

Recommendation 14: We recommend TEVAR in patients with IMH or PAU who have persistent symptoms
or complications or show evidence of disease progression on follow-up imaging after a period of hypertension
control. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
The natural history of and indications for repair in
patients with PAUs are controversial, but they have
been found in one series to grow 2 mm/y in their
maximal aortic size and length while growing an
average of only 1.2 mm/y in depth.98 The presence of
symptoms, an associated IMH, and an increase in pleural
effusion appear to be risk factors for complications.83,99
Treatment with TEVAR is indicated for patients who
are symptomatic despite best medical therapy or have
an increase in pleural effusion. The threshold for intervention for asymptomatic patients is also controversial.
According to one study, PAU depth >10 mm and diameter >20 mm are risk factors for progressive disease.99
Recommendation 15: We suggest TEVAR in selected
cases of asymptomatic PAU in patients who have atrisk characteristics for growth or rupture. Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B
(Moderate)
Practice Statement: In the absence of clear and widely
accepted parameters, the decision to intervene in
asymptomatic patients with IMH and PAUs should be
individualized. Asymptomatic patients treated for PAUs
in the setting of a maximal aortic diameter <5.5 cm or
with PAUs <10 mm deep or <20 mm in diameter need
further study. (Ungraded good practice statement)
