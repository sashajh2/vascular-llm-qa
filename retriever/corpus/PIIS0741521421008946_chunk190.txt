% and coinsurance has increased by 106%.652 As a
result, many healthcare facilities are asking patients to
pay out-of-pocket expenses up front.653 In fact, there is
evidence that many patients are delaying or foregoing
medical/surgical treatment because of out-of-pocket
costs.654 Massachusetts became the ﬁrst state in the
United States to require hospitals to post healthcare prices.655 Of particular relevance to vascular surgeons, the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed
that hospitals post prices online.656 It seems undeniable
that patients will be increasingly focused on the cost of
proposed procedures as well as the potential clinical
beneﬁts and risks. As a result, several organizations
have determined that it is now appropriate for clinical
practice guidelines to factor in cost in determining best
practices.657,658 The respective costs of CEA vs CAS have
been studied in several institutional series, population

database studies, meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, and through models of cost efﬁcacy.
In an early institutional series, 45 patients with symptomatic carotid stenoses who were considered high risk (NASCET-ineligible) for CEA underwent CAS between 1996 and
2002, and their costs were compared with a control series
of 391 patients with comparable risk factors who underwent CEA. Median total costs were $10,628 vs $10,148
(P ¼ .495) for CAS and CEA patients, respectively. However,
these results are confounded by a length of stay of 4.1 days
for CEA, which is not the standard of care in current domestic practice, compared with a length of stay of
1.6 days for CAS. When data were adjusted for length of
stay, CEA was less costly than CAS.659 In another early institutional series of 46 patients undergoing CAS and 48 patients undergoing CEA, CAS was associated with higher
total procedural costs ($17,402 vs $12,112; P ¼ .029) and
direct costs
