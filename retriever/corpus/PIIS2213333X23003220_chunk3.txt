Summary of recommendations and statements
1. Evaluation of patients with varicose veins
1.1. Classiﬁcation and grading of clinical severity of chronic venous disorders
Good Practice Statements
1.1.1.

We recommend the use of the 2020 updated clinical stage, etiology, anatomy, pathology (CEAP) classiﬁcation system for
chronic venous disorders. The clinical or basic CEAP classiﬁcation can be used for clinical practice, and the full CEAP
classiﬁcation system should be used for clinical research.

1.1.2.

We recommend the use of the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) for patients with chronic venous disorders for
grading of clinical severity and for assessment of post treatment outcome.

1.2-1.5. Doppler ultrasound scanning
