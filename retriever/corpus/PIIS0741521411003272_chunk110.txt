4 to 6 years when they used microfoam to treat incompetent GSV in 415 limbs.
In 808 patients with 1411 affected limbs, Coleridge
Smith306 used 1% polidocanol, 1% STS, and 3% STS in the
form of foam to treat incompetent saphenous trunks, and
459 limbs were available for duplex imaging at a follow-up
of â±–6 months. The GSV remained obliterated in 88% of
limbs and the SSV in 82%.
A Cochrane review on sclerotherapy published by Tisi
et al40 in 2006 concluded that evidence supports the current place of sclerotherapy in modern clinical practice,
which is usually limited to treatment of recurrent varicose
veins after surgery and thread veins.
The efficacy of foam sclerotherapy on QOL was recently demonstrated in a single-center cohort study by
Darvall et al.334 These author found that ultrasoundguided foam sclerotherapy for great and small saphenous
varicose veins leads to significant improvements in generic
and disease-specific health related QOL for at least 12
months after treatment.
Surgery vs sclerotherapy. A Cochrane review in 2004
examined results of surgery vs sclerotherapy for the treatment of varicose veins. Rigby et al335 reviewed 2306 references that included 61 comparative studies and 9 randomized trials. The study observed a trend that sclerotherapy
was better at 1 year and surgery had a better outcome at 3
to 5 years. The meta-analysis concluded, however, that
there was insufficient evidence to preferentially recommend
sclerotherapy for treatment of varicose veins over surgical
treatment.
Wright et al325 reported the effect of polidocanol microfoam and compared its use with surgery or sclerotherapy
in the management of varicose veins. This European RCT
found that 1% microfoam was inferior to surgery but supe-
