� .02), only 46.9% of patients returned to routine
daily activities within 1 day, and the number of days to
return to work averaged 12.4 days (95% CI, 8.66-16.23
days).
HL/S vs high ligation alone. HL/S of the GSV reduced the risk of reoperation by two-thirds at 5 years after
surgery in a prospective randomized study reported by
Dwerryhouse et al.196 The authors randomized 133 legs of
100 patients to high ligation or HL/S. The need for
reoperation was 6% in patients who underwent HL/S vs
20% in those patients who underwent high ligation alone
(P ⬎ .02). The reason for this is that patients with only high
ligation have recurrent reflux in the residual GSV, which
causes new symptoms and increases the risk of reoperation.
The effect of saphenous stump closure on outcome. In an
RCT, Frings et al197 found more neovascularization in
patients who had the endothelium of the saphenous stump
exposed vs those who had the saphenous stump oversewn
with a running nonabsorbable polypropylene suture. (Neovascularization has been defined as the presence of multiple
new small tortuous veins in anatomic proximity to a previous venous intervention.51) No conclusion could be
reached, however, on the type of suture used to ligate the
stump. Neoreflux was the same after ligature with absorbable suture vs nonabsorbable suture.
An RCT by Winterborn et al198 observed no difference
in varicose vein recurrence if a standard saphenofemoral
ligation (transfixation and ligation using nonabsorbable
suture, with exposed endothelium of the stump) or a flush
saphenofemoral ligation (the stump was oversewn with a
running polypropylene suture, with no endothelium exposed) was used. At 2 years, the recurrence rate was 33% in
the standard group and 32% in the flush group (P ⫽ .90).
Neovascularization was
