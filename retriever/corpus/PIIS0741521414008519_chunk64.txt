is useful to classify stages of venous disease, its components
have been recognized to be relatively static and insufﬁcient
for determining changes in venous disease severity. For
example, a patient presenting with an active VLU will be clinical CEAPe6 but when the ulcer heals can improve at best
only to clinical CEAPe5. Despite this shortcoming, there
has been general acceptance and wide dissemination of
CEAP for both clinical and research purposes, making
CEAP an essential component of venous disease classiﬁcation.
In an effort to improve standardized outcome assessment of venous disease with gradable elements that can
change in response to treatment, the Venous Clinical
Severity Score (VCSS) was introduced in 2000 and revised
in 2010 (Table VI). The VCSS system includes 10 clinical
descriptors (
