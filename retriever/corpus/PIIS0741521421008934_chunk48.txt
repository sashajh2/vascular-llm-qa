enable to percutaneous coronary intervention should undergo such intervention,
followed by treatment of the carotid stenosis. In addition,
patients should be considered for CEA with regional
anesthesia before CABG, if possible.139-141
Recommendation 5.1. For patients with symptomatic
carotid stenosis of 50% to 99%, who require both CEA
and CABG, we suggest CEA before, or concomitant
with, CABG to potentially reduce the risk of stroke
and stroke/death. The sequencing of the intervention
depends on the clinical presentation and institutional
experience (grade 2C).
5.2. For patients with severe (70%-99%) bilateral
asymptomatic carotid stenosis or severe asymptomatic stenosis and contralateral occlusion, we suggest
CEA before or concomitant with CABG (grade 2C).
5.3. For patients requiring carotid intervention, staged
or synchronous with coronary intervention, we suggest
that the decision between CEA and CAS be determined by the timing of the procedure, the need for
anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, patient anatomy, and patient characteristics (grade 2B).
