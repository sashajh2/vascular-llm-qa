hesia. Interestingly, no dose effect was noticed:
1000 mg was as effective as 1500 mg/d. A meta-analysis15
found calcium dobesilate effectiveness comparable to
Ruscus extracts in reducing foot volume and ankle circumferences. Data from a postmarketing surveillance
report 1974 to 1998, the international literature (19702003) and periodic safety update report 1995 to 2003
from the French Regulatory authorities, was reviewed
to assess the safety proﬁle of calcium dobesilate.298
Adverse events included fever (26%), gastrointestinal disorders (12.5%), skin reactions (8.2%), arthralgia (4.3%), and
agranulocytosis (4.3%). No death was related to calcium
dobesilate administration. The authors concluded that
the adverse events’ risk with calcium dobesilate is low
despite 13 known cases of agranulocytosis in patients
treated by calcium dobesilate.
Clinical beneﬁt of horse chestnut extract.
Rationale. Horse chestnut extract contains escin, a
mixture of triterpene saponins, and some benzopyrones.
Escin has a veno-contractile properties and a protective
effect on endothelium, through the increased production of nitric oxide.299
Evidence. A Cochrane review300 covered electronic
data bases search and material collected from manufacturers of horse chestnut extract products with published and unpublished studies and non-English articles.
The included RCTs in patients with CVI compared efﬁcacy and safety of oral horse chestnut extract monopreparations with placebo, or reference therapy. Assessment of symptoms shown signiﬁcantly better than placebo efﬁcacy in improvement of leg pain (7 RCT).
Evaluation of the leg volume change in 6 placebocontrolled trials reported a 32.1 mL weighted mean difference (95% CI, 13.49-50.72) in favor of horse chestnut
extract. This efﬁcacy was found comparable to
compression stockings in another trial.301 The treatment
safety was excellent. The authors concluded that “horse
chestnut extract is an efﬁcacious and
