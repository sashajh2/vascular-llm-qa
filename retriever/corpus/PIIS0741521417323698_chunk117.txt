advanced ischemic colitis leading to perforation, is
associated with a mortality rate in excess of 90%,481 and a
retrospective review of 222 patients revealed that
ischemic colitis is the most common cause of death after
open repair of a ruptured aneurysm.482 Colonic ischemia
is much less frequent after EVAR than after OSR for
ruptured aneurysm (23% vs 42%), but the risk
remains.403,480,483 Prompt endoscopy is recommended
when ischemic colitis is suspected to conﬁrm the diagnosis and to help guide management.
Multisystem organ failure. Given the associated
hemodynamic instability and ischemia-reperfusion
injury among patients presenting with a ruptured aneurysm, multisystem organ failure may occur in 1% to 3% of
patients after EVAR or open repair.484,485 Once multisystem organ failure develops, organ dysfunction leads to
a prolonged ICU stay, high resource consumption, and a
50% to 70% mortality rate.486 Dedicated ICU teams and
regionalized care at high-volume centers have led to
reduced mortality and decreased length of stay.487,488
Special considerations
Inﬂammatory aneurysm. An inﬂammatory aortic
aneurysm occurs in between 5% and 10% of patients.489
An inﬂammatory aortic aneurysm may not be readily
apparent on CT imaging but may be associated with
retroperitoneal ﬁbrosis490,491 and displays a similar natural history to the more common degenerative aortic
aneurysm.492,493 An inﬂammatory aortic aneurysm is
typically adherent to the duodenum and, less
commonly, the ureters, renal vein, and inferior vena
cava.494 Should open repair be required, a
