EVAR, Endovascular aneurysm repair; OAR, open aneurysm repair.
From Eslami MH, Rybin D, Doros G, Kalish JA, Farber A; Vascular Study
Group of New England. Comparison of a Vascular Study Group of New
England risk prediction model with established risk prediction models
of in-hospital mortality after elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
J Vasc Surg 2015;62:1125-33.e2.

larger than 6.5 cm, 5-year survival was 28%. In a recent
study, those patients declined for AAA repair had a 2year survival of 35%.311 Thus, for a patient with high operative risk and shortened life expectancy, rupture risk
must be high for beneﬁt to be obtained from EVAR.
We suggest informing patients contemplating open repair or
EVAR of their VQI perioperative mortality risk score.

EVAR
EVAR has rapidly expanded as the preferred approach
for treatment of AAA since the ﬁrst report >25 years
ago.312,313 Since the introduction of EVAR, the annual
number of deaths from intact and ruptured AAAs has
signiﬁcantly decreased in the United States. This has
coincided with an increase in elective AAA repair and a
decrease in the diagnosis and repair of ruptured AAAs.51
Considerations for percutaneous repair. EVAR has
evolved since its inception with the development of
