) because the trial was small and
the results had not been replicated in other trials with a longer
follow up period.
The Society’s committee charged with developing
guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower
extremities has decided to strike recommendation 4.11 based
on the current state of evidence after retraction of this trial.
The committee notes that many patients with IC may
still beneﬁt from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
(ACEIs) for other conditions such as hypertension and
congestive heart failure, which are common in patients

with PAD. ACEIs remain contraindicated in individuals
with known renal artery stenosis. Further research is
needed to determine if ACEIs have a useful role in the
treatment of walking impairment or leg symptoms associated with IC.
