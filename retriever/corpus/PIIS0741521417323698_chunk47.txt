Renal insufﬁciency. Preoperative renal insufﬁciency is
an established risk factor for poor outcome after aneurysm repair. Among patients with moderate renal
dysfunction (eGFR of 30-60 mL/min), mortality and cardiovascular events are more likely for patients treated
by OSR than by EVAR.89 However, outcomes are uniformly poor in the presence of severe renal dysfunction
(eGFR < 30 mL/min), regardless of the type of repair.
Outcomes are equally poor after EVAR or OSR for the
patient requiring dialysis, with a 30-day mortality of 11%,

with Kaplan-Meier survival estimates of 66% at 1 year and
37% at 3 years.117 Median survival was 2 years.117
Signiﬁcant declines in renal mass and eGFR have been
documented after OSR and EVAR, even in the setting of
age-adjusted normal renal function before surgery.118 For
example, acute kidney injury and chronic kidney injury
have been noted after complex EVAR with snorkel or
renal stent placement, with an increased risk among
women.119 Even transient postoperative renal dysfunction is associated with an increase in mortality, morbidity,
and the need for additional ICU support.120
Several strategies have been recommended to minimize renal injury after EVAR or OSR. Hydration with
either normal saline or sodium bicarbonate is recommended to ensure euvolemia.121 Similarly, given the
association of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor
antagonists with hypotension on induction of anesthesia,
these medications should be held the morning of
surgery and restarted after the patient is euvolemic.122,123
Whereas the administration of many agents has been
evaluated, none have proved of value in limiting renal
injury after AAA repair. Antioxidants, such as mannitol,
before or during OSR have demonstrated no beneﬁt.124
Likewise, fenoldop
