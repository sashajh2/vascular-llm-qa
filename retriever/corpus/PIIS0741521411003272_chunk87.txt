 reported 500 patients who underwent RFA, and 13 (2.6%)
experienced thrombus bulging into the femoral vein or
adherent to its wall, which was treated with low-molecularweight heparin. All of these patients had thrombus retraction to the level of the SFJ in an average of 16 days. A
significantly higher rate of proximal thrombus extension
was noted in those patients with a history of DVT and in
those with a GSV diameter of ⬎8 mm (P ⬍ .02).
For high-risk patients, several interventionists use a
single, preventive dose of low-molecular-weight heparin
before or at the beginning of the procedure, although data
on the effectiveness of such prophylaxis are not available.246
Performing the operation as an outpatient procedure under
local or tumescent anesthesia permits early ambulation that
decreases the risk of thromboembolic complications. In
addition, the use of elastic compression and frequent leg
elevation are also aimed at prevention of DVT or PE.
Results of EVLA. Early results from Navarro et al237
in 40 patients confirmed 100% saphenous occlusion at 4.2
months and suggested rapid and widespread use of this
therapy. Min et al266 reported 3-year results in 499 legs
treated with laser, demonstrating a saphenous occlusion
rate of 93%. In a large single-center cohort study, Myers
and Jolley264 treated 509 limbs with an 810-nm laser
during a 5-year period. The rate of primary occlusion at 4
years was 76%, and the secondary occlusion rate was 97%. A

al7 found an early saphenous occlusion rate of 88% to 100%,
and a review of 13 studies showed evidence of short-term
benefits.
EVLA of the SSV has been described by several
groups.266-268 Proebstle et
