 gastric branches, both open surgical ligation and endovascular embolization of these
aneurysms are reported. To evaluate the collaterals, selective angiography and high-resolution CTA are
recommended.

Given the high propensity of rupture and signiﬁcant antecedent mortality, we
recommend that all hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms, regardless of cause, be
repaired as soon as the diagnosis is made.

2.2.b

In asymptomatic patients without signiﬁcant comorbidity, we recommend repair
if true HAA is >2 cm (Grade 1A) or if aneurysm enlarges >0.5 cm/y (Grade 1C). In
patients with signiﬁcant comorbidities, we recommend open repair if HAA is
>5.0 cm (Grade 1B).

Hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm. False aneurysm of the
hepatic artery accounts for 25%93 to 80%148 of reported
cases and often occurs after iatrogenic injury or penetrating or blunt liver trauma, leading to symptomatic
presentation of these aneurysms. These antecedent
clinical events along with speciﬁc imaging distinguish
false aneurysms from true aneurysms. Imaging ﬁndings,
which include focal arterial disruption in the setting of
otherwise normal arteries and inﬂammatory changes
around an irregular aneurysm sac, are reported.1 The
majority of pseudoaneurysms are symptomatic at
