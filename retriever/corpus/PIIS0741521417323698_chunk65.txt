 MASS (£7600/life-year gained) suggest
that AAA screening in England and other European
countries will remain cost-effective even with prevalence
rates as low as 1%.260-262
Other challenges to efﬁcient implementation of
screening include the identiﬁcation and exclusion of patients who have had prior abdominal cross-sectional imaging studies, accounting for increasing longevity,
potential needs for late rescreening,263 and selective
screening to optimize yield at minimal cost.264 Reducing

all-cause mortality and enhancing yield might be
increased by integrating AAA screening with concurrent
echocardiography265 or blood pressure and peripheral
vascular disease testing.266 Ensuring full participation
for all groups of patients at risk remains an ever-present
challenge.267,268
We recommend a one-time ultrasound screening for AAAs in
men or women 65 to 75 years of age with a history of
tobacco use.

We suggest ultrasound screening for AAA in ﬁrst-degree
relatives of patients who present with an AAA. Screening
should be performed in ﬁrst-degree relatives who are
between 65 and 75 years of age or in those older than 75
years and in good health.

We suggest a one-time ultrasound screening for AAAs in men
or women older than 75 years with a history of tobacco use
and in otherwise good health who have not previously
received a screening ultrasound.

If initial ultrasound screening identiﬁed an aortic diameter
>2.5 cm but <3 cm, we suggest rescreening after 10 years.

Recommendations for aneurysm surveillance. Surveillance imaging should use ultrasound examinations
unless other imaging modalities are speciﬁcally indicated. The optimal frequency for surveillance after recognition of early-stage AAA disease has not been deﬁned
by randomized clinical study. Some authors have suggested that there is no need to observe patients with an
initial aortic diameter <3 cm, given their low risk for
rupture.
