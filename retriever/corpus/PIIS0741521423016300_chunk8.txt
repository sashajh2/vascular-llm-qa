Best Practice Statement

23. In a person with diabetes and peripheral artery disease the following
target levels should be:
HbA1c < 8% (< 64 mmol/mol), but higher target HbA1c value may be
necessary depending on the risk of severe hypoglycaemia.
Blood pressure < 140/ 90 mmHg but higher target levels may be
necessary depending on the risk of orthostatic hypotension and
other side effects.
Low density lipoprotein target of < 1.8 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) and
reduced by at least 50% of baseline. If high intensity statin therapy
(with or without ezetimibe) is tolerated, target levels < 1.4 mmol/L (55
mg/dL) are recommended.
Best Practice Statement

24. In a person with diabetes and symptomatic peripheral artery disease:
treatment with single antiplatelet therapy should be used,
treatment with clopidogrel should be considered as ﬁrst choice in
preference to aspirin,
combination therapy with aspirin (75 mg to 100 mg once daily) plus
low dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) should be considered for
people without a high bleeding risk.

Best Practice Statement

25. In a person with type 2 diabetes and peripheral artery disease:
with an eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73m2, a sodium glucose cotransporter-2
(SGLT-2) inhibitor or a glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist with
demonstrated cardiovascular disease beneﬁt should be considered,
irrespective of the blood glucose level.
SGLT-2 inhibitors should not be started in drug naïve people with a
diabetes related foot ulcer or gangrene and temporary discontinuation should be considered in people already using these drugs, until
the affected foot is healed.
