 thrombosis as involving the iliofemoral veins,
with or without extension into the inferior vena cava;
the femoropopliteal veins; or isolated to the calf veins in
preference to simple characterization of a thrombus as
proximal or distal (Grade 1A). Based on perceived differences in outcomes, DVT has historically been considered
to involve the proximal veins or as isolated to the distal or
calf veins. On the basis of the most central extent of
thrombosis, proximal venous thrombosis includes femoropopliteal thrombosis and iliofemoral thrombosis. As defined by the Society of Interventional Radiology,26,27 iliofemoral DVT involves complete or partial thrombosis of
the iliac vein or the common femoral vein, or both, with or
without femoropopliteal DVT. Femoropopliteal DVT involves the femoral or popliteal venous segments, or both,
without extension to the common femoral or iliac veins. It
is becoming increasingly clear that the natural history of
femoropopliteal and iliofemoral thrombosis is significantly
different and that simple stratification of treatment according to involvement of the “proximal” or “distal” veins is no
longer adequate.
From a pathophysiologic perspective, thrombolytic
studies have shown that iliofemoral venous thrombosis is
associated with a very high incidence of underlying anatomic abnormalities in the iliac veins.16 Compared with
femoropopliteal thrombosis, iliofemoral thrombosis is also

associated with less complete recanalization and a higher
incidence of residual venous obstruction. Although the iliac
segments frequently lack valves, persistent proximal venous
obstruction may be potentially associated with the development of reflux in more caudal segments that were not
initially thrombosed.28
Not surprisingly, iliofemoral venous thrombosis is associated with severe hemodynamic derangements that may
be persistent.29 Acutely, iliofemoral thrombosis may compromise the primary venous
