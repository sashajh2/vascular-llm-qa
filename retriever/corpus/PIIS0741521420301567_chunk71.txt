vasculitis. Given the rarity of this condition, no speciﬁc
guidelines were generated, and the management of
those patients should be individualized.
Some authors have pointed to the possible association
of dissection and aneurysmal degeneration of the
dissected artery.175 Yun et al168 classiﬁed these isolated
dissections into three groups based on angiographic
ﬁndings. In patients followed up by Dong et al167 or
Yun et al,168 no aneurysmal degenerations were
observed. Initial treatment of these entities is often antiplatelet therapy unless symptoms recur or are refractory
to conservative management.168 The presence of superior mesenteric artery dissection is not an indication for
repair as the majority are treated conservatively without
any need for intervention.167,168

CTA of abdomen and pelvis has signiﬁcant speciﬁcity
and sensitivity for detecting concomitant visceral artery
aneurysm and has proved to be the best modality in
detecting visceral artery aneurysm.166,177
Annual CTA scans are speciﬁc and sensitive in following
up the repair and assess other vascular beds.166,177

JEJUNAL, ILEAL, AND COLIC ARTERY
ANEURYSMS
Aneurysms of the jejunal, ileal, and colic arteries account for <3% of all visceral aneurysms, affecting men
and women equally beyond the sixth decade of
life.87,163 Most of the literature on these aneurysms is
limited to case reviews and small case numbers within

We recommend an endovascular-ﬁrst approach to all SMAAs if it is
anatomically feasible.

Treatment must be individualized on the basis of anatomy and characteristics of the SMAA. Angiography is critical to delineate superior mesenteric artery anatomy and
collaterals. Both open and endovascular techniques
must exclude the an
