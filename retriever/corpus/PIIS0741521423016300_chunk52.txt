 PAD, and either a foot ulcer or
gangrene, how does endovascular revascularisation
compare with open or hybrid revascularisation?

Recommendation 17
In a person with diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and a foot
ulcer or gangrene who has an adequate single segment
saphenous vein in whom infrainguinal revascularisation is
indicated and who is suitable for either approach, consider
bypass in preference to endovascular therapy.

Recommendation 18
A person with diabetes, peripheral artery disease (PAD) and a
foot ulcer or gangrene, should be treated in a centre with
expertise in, or rapid access to, endovascular and surgical
bypass revascularisation. In this setting, consider making
treatment decisions based on the risk to and preference of
the individual, limb threat severity, anatomical distribution of
PAD, and the availability of autogenous vein.

Best Practice Statement

Rationale
Once the decision to revascularise has been made, the
next decision is whether an endovascular, an open (i.e.,
bypass or endarterectomy) procedure, or a combination
of both (i.e., hybrid procedure) should be performed.
Recommendation 18 highlights the complementary
role of open and endovascular techniques in contemporary vascular practice. In particular, endovascular techniques have largely replaced open surgery in the
management of aorto-iliac disease and also allow treatment of foot and pedal arch disease.
The majority of studies identiﬁed in the systematic review on endovascular and bypass surgical outcomes
were observational and retrospective case series, with a
high risk of bias.7 The BEST CLI trial was a large randomised clinical trial with low risk of bias comparing an
endovascular ﬁrst with a surgical ﬁrst approach. People
with CLTI who were deemed appropriate for revascularisation for infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease were
included.111 The primary outcome was above ankle
amputation of the index limb or a major reintervention in the index limb (new bypass, vein graft
interposition revision, thrombectomy or thrombolysis)
or death. It was designed in two parallel cohort trials:
