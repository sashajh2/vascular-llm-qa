 distally or the omohyoid muscle proximally may increase exposure.
The endarterectomy is begun by carefully developing a
subadvential plane with a freer dissector in the common
carotid artery, completed circumferentially, feathered to a
good end-point proximally and continued distally, everting
the plaque out of the external carotid artery and then
completed in the internal carotid artery where the plaque
transitions into normal intima. Today, most evidence
strongly supports arteriotomy closure with an autogenous
vein, Dacron, or polytetrafluoroethylene patch using a running 6-0 polypropylene suture.
Alternatively, eversion endarterectomy is performed by
obliquely amputating the internal carotid artery at the
common carotid bifurcation and rolling back the adventitial layer until normal intima is recognized distally at the
distal endpoint. Residual plaque in the common and external carotid arteries is endarterectomized at this time. After
completion of the endarterectomy, the internal carotid
artery is re-anastomosed to the common carotid artery with
a running 6-0 polypropylene suture.
RECOMMENDATION
In symptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid
stenosis (â±–50%) and high perioperative risk, we suggest carotid artery stenting as a potential alternative treatment to
carotid endarterectomy. (GRADE 2 Recommendation, low
quality evidence). High anatomic risk defined as: (1) previous
CEA with recurrent stenosis; (2) prior ipsilateral radiation
therapy to neck with permanent skin changes; (3) previous
