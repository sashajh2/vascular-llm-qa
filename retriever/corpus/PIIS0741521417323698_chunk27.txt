30-day or in-hospital mortality rate
(high)
d Reduction in quality of life at 3 months was more
pronounced with open repair
d At 2 and 4 years, no difference in mortality (low)
d EVAR required more reinterventions and was associated with increased late rupture (high)
d

Elective EVAR was associated with lower immediate
postoperative mortality and morbidity (low, observational data)

d

EVAR was associated with a decreased risk of 30day mortality and 30-day morbidity and shorter
length of hospitalization (moderate); long-term
survival and the need for reintervention were similar
(low)

Open vs endovascular repair
(obese patients)

d

EVAR had lower 30-day postoperative mortality and
fewer early postoperative complications (MI, chest
infection, renal failure, wound infection); risks of
postoperative bowel ischemia and stroke were similar
(low)

Open vs endovascular repair
(ruptured AAA)

d

EVAR had lower mortality in 31 studies that was
insigniÔ¨Åcant in pooled analysis of three recent trials or
in an adjusted analysis (low)

Transperitoneal vs retroperitoneal
approach for elective open AAA repair

d

No difference in mortality (low)
Retroperitoneal approach may reduce blood loss,
hospital stay, and ICU stay (low)
d No differences in aortic cross-clamp time and operating time
