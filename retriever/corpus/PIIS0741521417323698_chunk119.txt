 a transperitoneal approach may be considered with division of
the “isthmus.”513-515 A hybrid approach has been
described using a bifurcated Dacron graft based off the
external iliac artery to revascularize the horseshoe kidney,
followed by EVAR.516,517 Likewise, repair has also been
described using a fenestrated endograft and snorkel
grafts.518,519
Aortocaval ﬁstula. A ruptured aneurysm associated
with an aortocaval ﬁstula has been reported in 0.22% to
6% of patients.520 The triad of abdominal pain, pulsatile
mass, and abdominal “machinery” bruit is present in up to
80% of cases.521-524 Patients presenting with an abdominal aneurysm and high-output heart failure or a paradoxical pulmonary embolism should also be suspected of
having an aortocaval ﬁstula.525-529 Duplex ultrasound imaging will reveal an arterial ﬂow pattern in the inferior vena
cava, and CT imaging will demonstrate contrast material
in the inferior vena cava during the arterial phase.530-533
EVAR is preferred,534-540 with expected resolution of preoperative heart failure and other physiologic disturbances.541-544 If open repair is required, venous bleeding
should be anticipated and care taken to minimize the risk
of pulmonary air embolism or embolism of thrombotic
debris by placement of sponge sticks proximal and distal
to the aortocaval ﬁstula for control, followed by direct suture repair of the defect.545,546
Since 2013, an additional 53 patients presenting with an
aortocaval ﬁstula have been added to the previously
reported 250 cases.547 The majority have been successfully treated with EVAR alone, with occasional use of an
Amplatzer plug548 or additional placement of a covered
stent in the inferior vena cava.549-552
