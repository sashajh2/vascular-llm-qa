 on the cohort being treated
(Table XIII).173,413-418 Percutaneous iliac and caval vein
stenting has become the preferred technique of many centers for iliocaval and some common femoral vein occlusive/
stenotic conditions, such as the post-thrombotic condition
or that of the May-Thurner primary disorder when it is
technically achievable.419-427 Extension of the iliac vein
stent below the inguinal ligament did not result in stent
fracture, erosion, arteriovenous ﬁstula, or higher incidence
of stent thrombosis than is inherent to post-thrombotic
disease.428 In the presence of combined iliac obstruction
and infrainguinal reﬂux, treatment of the iliac obstruction
is recommended as the ﬁrst procedure, with repair of reﬂux
below the iliac level reserved for persistently symptomatic
cases.
Guideline 6.15: Proximal Chronic Venous Occlusion/Severe Stenosis (Bilateral) With Recalcitrant
Venous UlcerdOpen Repair
In a patient with inferior vena cava or iliac vein
chronic occlusion or severe stenosis, with or without
lower extremity deep venous reﬂux disease, that is associated with a recalcitrant venous leg ulcer and failed
endovascular treatment, we suggest open surgical bypass
with use of an externally supported expanded polytetraﬂuoroethylene graft in addition to standard compression
therapy to aid in venous leg ulcer healing and to prevent
recurrence. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Most series suggest the need for large conduits from
normal distal to normal proximal vein with supportive arteriovenous ﬁstula to increase ﬂow during early healing. No
