er et al259 also reported that early
DUS (1 day) ﬁndings did not correlate with clinical or
hemodynamic success 1 year after SFA-popliteal angioplasty.
In a more recent study, Humphries et al260 reported that
an abnormal duplex examination within the ﬁrst 30 days of
treatment in patients undergoing infrainguinal EVT for
CLI, was associated with an increased subsequent risk of
amputation.

Other investigators have reported that despite intense
surveillance, outcomes after long-segment percutaneous
treatment of SFA lesions are suboptimal. Gray et al261 reported that even with close surveillance and prophylactic
reintervention, anatomic patency after intervention with selective stenting for long-segment SFA lesions (mean length,
16.5 cm) at 1 year was poor, although clinical outcomes were
favorable. After tibial interventions, Schmidt et al262 reported an angiographic >50% restenosis rate of 31.2% and
a treated segment occlusion rate of 37.6% at 3 months after
treatment of long-segment (>8 cm) tibial lesions, despite
high rates of clinical success and limb salvage in most patients
with Rutherford 4 and 5 ischemia. These and other studies
suggest that unlike vein graft surveillance, duplex-derived
patency is poorly correlated with the clinical success of
catheter-based interventions, making prophylactic interventions on the basis of duplex data highly questionable.
Clinical follow-up and hemodynamic assessment alone after infrainguinal EVT has been proposed. Tielbeek et al263 reported a prospective assessment of 124 patients during a 5-year
period who underwent EVT for femoropopliteal disease.
Although a duplex-detected Vr >2.5 at the intervention site
predicted subsequent occlusion of the treated arterial segment,
they observed that only one patient with failure would have
received a redo endovascular procedure at the time he had
restenosis, supporting their bias that clinical and hemodynamic
assessments were more useful than DUS for follow-up. Spijkerboer et al264 monitored patients with serial DUS after iliac interventions and found that the clinical
