160 The
closure rate at 2 years was 96.3%. No major complications, including sural nerve injury, were noted. In a
retrospective study, the results of high ligation and
stripping of the SSV were compared with those after the
MOCA procedure to treat isolated SSV reﬂux.161 The
recurrence rate at 18 months was similar in the two
groups. The MOCA procedure, performed in 60 limbs,
had resulted in less pain on the ﬁrst postoperative day
and the patients had returned to work earlier than those
who had undergone open surgery. Leg paresthesia had
occurred in 3.4% after open surgery and 0% after the
MOCA procedure.161 Other investigators had observed
more saphenous neuritis after thermal ablation.162
A systematic review by Boersma et al163 of 49 studies
reporting on ﬁve RCTs and 44 cohort studies found a
58%, 98.5% and 97.1% anatomic success rate after surgery,
EVLA, and RFA, respectively, and 63.3% success after
physician-compounded UGFS at a mean follow-up of
12.5 months (range, 0.5-48 months). The incidence of
neurologic complications was most frequent after surgery
(19.6%) and thermal ablation (EVLA, 4.8%; RFA, 9.7%).
These pooled data had considerable heterogeneity. The
study supported the use of thermal ablation (EVLA or
RFA) for SSV treatment over surgery. A Cochrane review
of three RCTs also found that at a moderate to low level
of evidence, EVLA had resulted in a higher closure rate
at 6 weeks and lower recurrence at 1 year than open surgery. The quality of evidence was low to suggest the use of
physician-compounded UGFS over surgery. Additional
RCTs with longer follow-up are needed to deﬁne the
optimal treatment of SSV ablation. However, the lack of
neurologic injury after nonthermal ablation is promising
and appears to be of considerable clinical beneﬁt.
