from which 29 evidence synthesis reports (systematic
reviews and meta-analyses) were used to grade the
quality of evidence (Table I) in various topics that relate
to AAA, such as screening, diagnosis, surveillance, and
treatment.

GENERAL APPROACH TO THE PATIENT
History and risk factors for AAA
The risk of an AAA as well as of aneurysm enlargement
and rupture for each patient and related family members can largely be determined by a thorough medical,
family, and social history. Abdominal aortic ultrasound
screening studies obtained in the United States between
2003 and 2008 were analyzed from >3 million men and
women, from diverse racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic
backgrounds.33 Participants completed a 36-item questionnaire on demographic and medical, social, and family history information as well as self-reported weight and
height.
These data were used to generate a multivariable
model for risk, which conﬁrmed age as the most significant risk factor for development of an AAA, with a
signiﬁcant increase in risk for the ages of 65 to 69 years
(odds ratio [OR], 5.4) and 75 to 79 years (OR, 14.5).
