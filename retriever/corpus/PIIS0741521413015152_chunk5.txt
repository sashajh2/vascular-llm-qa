only after requiring a major amputation; and 33% died
with limbs intact but with unhealed wounds. The authors
concluded by stating that “diabetic patients with ischemic
foot ulcers not available for revascularization are not
excluded from healing without major amputation.Our
ﬁndings reinforce the need for a classiﬁcation system considering these factors at decision.”13 These observations highlight the challenges in interpreting limb salvage and
amputation-free survival outcomes in the literature, particularly when making comparisons between different reports or
non-randomized groups.
CURRENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS
In modern practice, patients with a threatened lower
extremity present with a broad spectrum of underlying
contributory factors of which ischemia is just one component, albeit an important one, in determining whether
that limb can be salvaged. Existing CLI classiﬁcation
systems fail to adequately categorize the extent of tissue
loss or the presence and severity of infection. The clinical
classiﬁcation systems that include the broad categories of
rest pain, ischemic ulceration, and gangrene (Rutherford
4, 5, and 68; Fontaine III, IV14), while adequate for identifying patients at increased risk for major limb amputation
and death, are not sufﬁciently detailed to stratify the range
of risk or determine best therapy across this heterogeneous
spectrum of patients. Controversies over revascularization
approaches (open bypass vs endovascular therapy),15-17
and nonrevascularization approaches (local wound care vs
hyperbaric oxygen therapy vs cell-based therapy)18-22
cannot be resolved without more precise stratiﬁcation of
the patients being treated. In addition, recent trends have
focused excessively on anatomic extent of disease and arteriographic ﬁndings without sufﬁcient emphasis on the
physiologic state of the limb.
The marked demographic shift over the last quarter
century because of the global epidemic of diabetes has
made the admonition of the original drafters of the term
CLI increasingly relevant. The rising incidence of diabetes
and diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) as well as an increased
incidence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in patients
