 evaluated and treated for any superﬁcial or perforator
reﬂux per Guidelines 6.1 to 6.8. For the remaining
Guidelines 6.9 to 6.17, the status of the deep venous system is the only pathologic process requiring treatment. The
risks of open procedures, which speciﬁcally include infection,
difﬁculty in healing of incisions required for treatment,
increased local trauma, hematoma formation, and need for
general anesthesia, set open operations apart from the less
invasive percutaneous methods. As a result, in patients
with clinically signiﬁcant iliac and caval obstruction combined with infrainguinal reﬂux or obstruction, percutaneous
balloon angioplasty with stenting is suggested as the initial
procedure over deep venous valvular reconstructions or
open operative bypass procedures because it is much less
invasive and presents less risk to the patient.

Guideline 6.9: Infrainguinal Deep Venous
Obstruction and Skin Changes at Risk for Venous
Leg Ulcer (C4b), Healed (C5) or Active (C6) Venous
Leg Ulcer
In a patient with infrainguinal deep venous obstruction and skin changes at risk for venous leg ulcer (C4b),
healed venous leg ulcer (C5), or active venous leg ulcer
(C6), we suggest autogenous venous bypass or endophlebectomy in addition to standard compression therapy to aid in venous ulcer healing and to prevent
recurrence. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Evidence is limited to case series and is further complicated by the variable combinations of reﬂux and obstruction
that may be encountered from the calf to the inferior vena
cava. There will frequently be a mixture of primary valve
reﬂux and post-thrombotic secondary venous occlusion at
different levels of the venous tree, and decisions as to the
most critical site of disease have to be made from detailed
preoperative anatomic analysis of the extremity veins. The
principles that guide the choice of an individual procedure
include the need for adequate inﬂow pressure and volume
