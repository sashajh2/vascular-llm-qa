82-8.09), arm ischemia (OR, 47.7; 95% CI,
9.9-229.3), and vertebrobasilar ischemia (OR, 10.8; 95% CI,
3.17-36.7). More data have been published since 2009,
such as a large single-center series in which the combined stroke, paraplegia, and death rate comparing LSA
revascularization with coverage alone is a striking 0% vs
27.9% (P < .001).143 Additional ﬁndings from a 2017 report
revealed a higher 30-day stroke rate in cases in which the
LSA was covered compared with when it was revascularized (14.3% vs 1.9%, respectively; P ¼ .02).137 The
consistent nature of these ﬁndings (including another
meta-analysis144) supports elective LSA revascularization
to lower the risk of stroke and paraplegia. Certain limitations persist in the observational nature of these data,
including heterogeneous patients, infrequent and
inconsistently deﬁned outcomes of interest, and underpowered studies. Large databases often exclude speciﬁc
populations, such as trauma patients, or do not capture
anatomic variables or staged LSA revascularization.145
LSA surgical revascularization is typically performed
with a left carotid-subclavian bypass, subclavian to carotid transposition, or carotid-axillary bypass, with similar
patency (84%-96% at 5 years)128,146,147 for each technique.
On occasion, when the left vertebral artery arises directly
from the arch or is very proximal on the LSA, a separate
vertebral transposition or bypass is necessary. A transposition is relatively contraindicated when there is coronary
artery bypass from the LIMA as this would cause myocardial ischemia during subclavian artery clamping and,
potentially, difﬁculties in mobilizing the LSA cephalad if
it is tethered by the LIMA graft.
