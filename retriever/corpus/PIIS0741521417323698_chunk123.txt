 associated
with immunologic and infectious risks. Although preoperative autologous blood donation avoids disease transmission and transfusion reaction as well as stimulates
erythropoiesis, limitations include limited availability of
blood donation, increased expense, and potential waste
of nonused blood.565 Intraoperative cell salvage assists
in blood conservation, has been recommended if large
blood loss is anticipated, and may be helpful where
concerns of the safety of banked blood exist.566-568 A
prospective randomized trial of cell salvage in elective
cardiac surgery did not lead to a reduction in exposure to
allogeneic blood but did reduce the number of transfused units.569 Various methods of cell salvage, including

use of a cell saver or hemoﬁltration, have not been
associated with meaningful differences in clinical outcomes.570 A Cochrane review of cell salvage used in a
variety of operations demonstrated an overall reduction
of <1 unit per patient with decreased likelihood of
requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion but no alteration in clinical outcome.571 A meta-analysis of cell
salvage in open aneurysm repair conﬁrmed a reduced
requirement for blood transfusion.572 In addition, one
retrospective study has demonstrated that cell salvage is
associated with improved survival among patients
undergoing open repair of a ruptured aneurysm.573 Cell
salvage is contraindicated in the presence of infection or
malignant disease.
The beneﬁt of maintaining a predeﬁned hematocrit
level during OSR of aortic aneurysm is unknown, but
pre-emptive transfusion in the setting of rapid ongoing
blood loss is well supported.574 In the trauma literature,
plasma, platelets, and packed red blood cells in a 1:1:1 ratio and warm fresh whole blood instead of component
therapy have each been advocated.457,575,576 However,
retrospective studies have not consistently demonstrated a survival beneﬁt to a lower ratio of red cell transfusion to plasma transfusion for patients undergoing
open repair of a ruptured aneurysm.573,577 Furthermore,
withholding plasma and platelet transfusion until surgical repair is complete
