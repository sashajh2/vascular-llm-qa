complications, and medical therapy, with the majority of
the clinical decisions based on provider preference and
skill set. Both the femoral and brachial arteries are appropriate access sites, although an open brachial approach
may be favored based on the orientation of the mesenteric vessels (ie, posterior to anterior, cephalad to caudal),
the favorable vector forces associated with the antegrade introduction of the various endovascular catheters
and devices, and the diminutive size of the brachial artery with the inherent risk of injury or thrombosis associated with the percutaneous approach. Likewise, the
choice of wires (eg, 0.018 vs 0.035) should be dictated
by the speciﬁc characteristics of the lesion and provider
preference. A completion imaging study should be performed at the time of the procedure. Intraluminal pressure measurements may be helpful to document the
pressure gradient across the stent if there is any concern
about its appearance.
Balloon-expandable covered intraluminal stents seem
to be the optimal stent choice and likely afford the
same advantages as reported in other anatomic locations.126,127 The characteristics of the balloonexpandable stents (eg, high radial force, functionality at
short lengths, limited shortening with expansion) make
them well-suited for the common atherosclerotic, calciﬁed lesion at the oriﬁce of the mesenteric vessels.
Furthermore, the fabric of the covered stent seems to
inhibit the ingrowth of tissue seen with bare metal stents
that leads to the development of intimal hyperplasia and
recurrent stenoses. Generically, the balloon-expandable
and self-expanding stents should be viewed as complementary with the later potentially having a role in the
SMA for longer lesions (ie, beyond the oriﬁce), intraluminal dissections related to the initial endovascular technique, and for preserving any signiﬁcant collateral
vessels (eg, high take-off of a right hepatic artery).
Interestingly, there has been an evolution from angioplasty alone to balloon-expandable bare metal stents
to
balloon
