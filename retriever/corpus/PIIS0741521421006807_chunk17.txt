Numerous studies ($2300) have
demonstrated that identifying and
repairing graft-threatening lesions
prolongs bypass patency

Recommendation 7: We suggest that patients with an asymptomatic PAA who are not offered repair should be monitored annually for
changes in symptoms, pulse examination, extent of thrombus, patency of the outﬂow arteries, and aneurysm diameter (grade 2C)
