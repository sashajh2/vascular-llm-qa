 and identiﬁed
after TEVAR for TAA generally ranges from 3.2% to
6.2%,131 and it may be lethal in one third of these
cases.132 However, this range may vary according to the
indication for TEVAR. A meta-analysis of the Cooksponsored multicenter trials demonstrated even lower
rates in certain populations of patients, with a 30-day
stroke rate of 0% in the 56 patients treated for PAU. It
was also only 2.4% in the 329 patients treated for TAA.133
There is published consensus that coverage of the LSA
is associated with higher risk of stroke with TEVAR,
despite the fact that the stroke may not always be in
the posterior circulation. A series of 285 TEVAR patients
showed that coverage of the LSA was associated with

an 11% stroke rate compared with 3% when it was not
covered.134 The current debate centers on what interventions may reduce this risk. Approaches to prevent stroke
include careful manipulation of wires and catheters near
the carotid vessels, denitrogenation devices, accurate imaging and positioning of devices, routine LSA revascularization, and thorough understanding of each patient’s
arch and cerebral anatomy. A systematic review of 27
studies found a stroke rate of 5.6% associated with LSA
coverage and a reduction to 3.1% with LSA revascularization (not statistically signiﬁcant).135 In the Medtronic Outcomes of Thoracic Endovascular Repair (MOTHER)
registry of 1010 TEVAR patients, stroke was 2.2% without
coverage of LSA, 9.1% with coverage and no revascularization, and 5.1% with LSA coverage and revascularization,
supporting routine LSA revascularization.136 The largest
systematic review and meta-analysis support these ﬁndings. A review137 published in 2017 evaluated the incidence of stroke in 2594 patients treated with TEVAR
and found the incidence in patients when the LSA was
