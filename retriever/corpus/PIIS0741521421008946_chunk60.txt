 risk
with CAS was greater than that for CEA in asymptomatic
patients, the difference was not statistically signiﬁcant.
The actual risk between CAS and CEA in asymptomatic
patients for any periprocedural stroke was 2.5% vs 1.4%,
respectively, and any periprocedural stroke, death, or
postprocedural ipsilateral stroke was 2.5% vs 1.4%,
respectively. Results for transfemoral CAS and CEA
were both within the AHA recommended guidelines.219
In addition, the primary composite end point of the
study, which included any periprocedural stroke, death,
MI, or postprocedural ipsilateral stroke, was similar in

the two groups: 3.5% for transfemoral CAS and 3.6% for
CEA (P ¼ .96).
The recently completed ACT-1 Trial randomized 1453 patients 3:1 transfemoral CAS (1089) and CEA (364) in a noninferiority design.220 There was no difference in the
composite primary end point of death, stroke and MI between the transfemoral CAS group (3.8% 6 0.59% vs CEA
3.4% 6 0.98% (2.27% conﬁdence interval [CI], P ¼ .01 noninferior). Stroke and death risk was 2.9% for transfemoral CAS
and 1.7% for CEA (P ¼ .33), and major stroke and death was
identical in both groups at 0.6%. These results are considerably better than any other large study, including ACAS and
ACST, for both procedures. CREST and ACT-1 results
conﬁrm that CEA and CAS can be performed safely in carefully selected asymptomatic patients.
Similar to patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis,
concerns remain whether the latter data can be translated into “real-world” experience in asymptomatic patients. In a 2009 study of asymptomatic patients using
VQI data, transfemoral CAS was associated with a significantly higher risk of major complications compared
with CEA.221 The 30-day outcome
