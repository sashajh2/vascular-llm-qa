careful monitoring of the patient’s blood pressure and
heart rate is necessary. An arterial pressure monitor connected to the intervention sheath or a separate arterial
line allows for continuous blood pressure monitoring.366
Hemodynamic depression can increase stroke risk owing
to cerebral hypoperfusion in general and inadequate ﬂow
reversal in TCAR speciﬁcally. Atropine (0.4 to 1.0 mg) is often
used to prevent hemodynamic depression during angioplasty of the carotid bulb. Glycopyrrolate (0.4 mg) is an
alternative to atropine because it is associated with fewer
coronary side effects. Volume resuscitation followed by
epinephrine or dopamine can be used in patients with
persistent or refractory postoperative hypotension. Some
risk factors for persistent hypotension include type of stenosis, echogenic plaque morphology, carotid calciﬁcation
and distance from carotid bifurcation to maximum stenotic lesion (#10 mm).433 It is unusual for patients who
have had prior CEA to have signiﬁcant bradycardia because
the normal innervation of the carotid baroreceptor is interrupted during the initial procedure.434 In these cases, glycopyrrolate or atropine is administered only if hypotension or
bradycardia ensue.366
CNI after CEA
Although a CNI is likely the most common complication after CEA, it is typically mild, self-limited, and
without prolonged or signiﬁcant clinical sequelae. The
reported incidence ranges from 5% to 20%.417,435-438 In
a prospective study of patients who underwent CEA
and postoperative laryngoscopy evaluations, cranial
nerve injuries were found in 11.4% of 656 carotid operations.436 However, approximately one-third of the patients with documented cranial nerve injuries
diagnosed by otolaryngology examination were clinically
asymptomatic. In the CREST trial, the incidence of CNI
was 4.7%. However, there was no signi
