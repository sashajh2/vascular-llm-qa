uosity can increase the risk of technical
failure and stroke. In particular, the presence of ICA
tortuosity can make crossing the lesion and positioning
a distal embolic protection ﬁlter difﬁcult. In the
tortuous ICA it may be difﬁcult to ﬁnd a sufﬁcient
length of carotid artery above the lesion with parallel
walls, a challenge that may decrease the effectiveness
of distal embolic protection ﬁlters in trapping generated debris that can occur during the procedure.172
Atherosclerotic disease burden in the arch can directly
impact stroke risk during transfemoral CAS because of
catheter manipulations that need to be performed in
the aortic arch to engage the target vessel. This risk can
be best identiﬁed on preprocedure CTA.172
The presence of iliac artery occlusion, severe stenosis
or tortuosity can make sheath placement into the
aortic arch difﬁcult if not impossible. Alternative access
sites that traverse the aortic arch have been reported,
such as brachial or radial arterial access. Limited data
render assessment of the efﬁcacy of these approaches
unclear.
High risk for transcervical carotid stent. There are
limited data examining the efﬁcacy of transcarotid artery
revascularization (TCAR) in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with severe carotid occlusive disease. Since
this procedure accesses the CCA above the clavicle, relative contraindications include lesions that are less than
5 cm cranial to the clavicle.176 In addition, severe target
vessel tortuosity and small (<6 mm) CCA, signiﬁcantly
diseased CCA (excess calciﬁcation or thrombus) and/or
depth of CCA which make access difﬁcult are also relative contraindications.177,178
Lesion morphology
Lesion morphology such as echolucency, calciﬁcation,
long irregular plaques, the presence of fresh thrombus
or a string sign can affect outcomes and alter decision
making concerning carotid revascularization.172,175 This
section examines the impact of lesion morphology on
outcome following carotid re
