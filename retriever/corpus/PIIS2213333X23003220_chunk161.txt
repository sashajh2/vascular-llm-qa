 thrombophlebitis,
ablation should be performed once the inﬂammation
has resolved if there is evidence of pathologic reﬂux
on DUS.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Despite recognition that superﬁcial thrombophlebitis, also known as SVT, is more common than
DVT, there is less awareness of its associated morbidity
and little consensus on its management.254 While traditionally thought of as benign, recent studies have highlighted its association with DVT and PE if left untreated.
Studies show that SVT may progress to DVT in 6% to 44%
of patients; 20% to 33% may have asymptomatic PE; and
2% to 13% may have symptomatic PE. Superﬁcial venous
thrombosis involving the saphenous trunk has the
greatest association with VTE.34 Although the majority of
SVT occurs in varicose veins, SVT in nonvaricose veins
confers greater morbidity and few studies have stratiﬁed
treatment based on this distinction.34 Several therapies
including surgery, compression stockings, and nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aim to reduce
pain and inﬂammation, however, given the associated
progression to VTE, anticoagulation is recommended. Of
note, the application of warm compresses to the site of
SVT has never been evaluated in any study.
Evidence. These recommendations are supported by
two recent systematic reviews34,35 (Table XXIV). The
2018 Cochrane review included 33 studies involving 7296
patients with SVT of the legs.34 Treatments evaluated
included fondaparinux, rivaroxaban, LMWH, unfractionated heparin, NSAIDS, compression stockings, and
topical, intramuscular, or intravenous treatment as well
as surgical thrombectomy or ligation. A minority of
studies compared treatment to placebo and most
studies were small and of poor quality. Further, most
studies excluded patients with SVT that was within 3 cm
of the SFJ. The recommendations are primarily based on
one large placebo controlled RCT of 3002 participants
who received fondaparinux
