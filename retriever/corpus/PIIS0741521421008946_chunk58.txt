04).209 These studies seem to be promising and
have been supported by a clinical competency statement from the SVS210 and although it is important to
remember that to date the vast majority of TCAR procedures have been performed in patients at high
anatomic or medical risk for CEA the procedure appears
promising and further data in low-risk symptomatic patients are awaited.
Asymptomatic with a greater than 70% stenosis.
CEA for asymptomatic lesions. Patients with asymptomatic lesions currently account for a majority of carotid
interventions performed in the United States.1 As discussed elsewhere in this article, randomized controlled
trials such as ACAS and ACST that compared CEA with
best medical therapy showed favorable results for

CEA.28,169 ACAS demonstrated superiority of CEA over
antiplatelet therapy alone for asymptomatic patients
with carotid stenosis of greater than 60%, and these investigators recommended CEA for patients aged less
than 80 years as long as the expected combined stroke
and mortality risk for the surgeon was not more than 3%.
The long-term effectiveness of CEA in asymptomatic
patients was conﬁrmed by ACST I, as reported by Halliday et al194 compared with patients randomized to the
medical arm which primarily involved antithrombotic
and antihypertensive therapy, patients aged less than
75 years in the CEA arm had signiﬁcantly lower 10-year
stroke risk (13.3% vs 17.9%).
Some authorities suggest that CEA should be considered in average surgical risk patients with 60% to 99%
asymptomatic carotid stenosis only in the presence of
one or more risk factors that increase risk of late ipsilateral stroke. Those factors include stenosis progression, silent infarction on CTA/MRI, plaque echolucency,
intraplaque hemorrhage on MRI, large plaque area or
spontaneous embolization using TCD.10
Transfemoral CAS in asymptomatic lesions. Many
CAS studies have been in the form of “high-risk” registries.
