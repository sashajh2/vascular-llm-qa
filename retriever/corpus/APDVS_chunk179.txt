 is low.
However, if someone were to undergo a head-to-toe CT scan daily for a year, the probability of
developing leukemia would significantly increase, even though there isnâ€™t a direct correlation
between the dose of radiation and the observed effect. (Hamada and Fujimichi 2014)

The Eye and Radiation Exposure:
During radiological procedures, one organ that often goes unnoticed but is significantly exposed
is the eye, specifically the lens.
The lens of the eye is particularly sensitive to radiation .
 Cataracts: Prolonged exposure to significant radiation levels can lead to opacification of the lens (i.e. cataracts)
 This gradual process ultimately results in the development of cataracts, with the most
common subtype being posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataracts. (Loganovsky et al.
2020)
 A study conducted in 2013 examined the dose-effect relationship of radiation on the eyes
of interventional cardiologists and electrophysiologists. The study found that up to 25%
of the physicians involved had exceeded current exposure thresholds and were at risk of
developing radiation-induced cataracts. (Jacob et al. 2012)
Other ocular pathologies associated with radiation exposure include:

 Cataracts: Prolonged exposure to radiation may lead to the development of cataracts,
causing clouding of the lens.
 Glaucoma: Radiation exposure can contribute to glaucoma, a condition characterized
by increased intraocular pressure.
 Optic Neuropathy: Damage to the optic nerve due to radiation exposure can result
in vision impairment.
 Retinal Angiopathy: Radiation may impact retinal blood vessels, leading to angiopathy.
 Dry Eye Syndrome: Radiation exposure can cause dryness and discomfort in the eyes.
In recent years, there has been growing research interest in understanding the potential
adverse effects of long-term radiation exposure on ocular health.
The increased understanding of these risks has prompted a greater emphasis on the importance of safety equipment to protect the eyes. Proper use of protective gear such as lead
glasses and face shields is crucial for minimizing radiation exposure to ocular tissues.

The Skin and Radiation Exposure:
Skin changes of varying severity are a well-documented adverse reaction to radiation exposure. These changes can range from mild redness and irritation to severe necrosis and the
development of secondary skin cancers.
