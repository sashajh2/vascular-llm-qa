1C

Strong recommendation, lowquality or very-low-quality
evidence

Beneﬁts clearly outweigh risk
and burdens, or vice versa

2A

Weak recommendation, highquality evidence

Beneﬁts closely balanced with
risks and burdens

2B

Weak recommendation,
moderate-quality evidence

Beneﬁts closely balanced with
risks and burdens

2C

Weak recommendation, lowquality or very-low-quality
evidence

Uncertainty in the estimates of
beneﬁts and risk, and
burdens; Risk, beneﬁt, and
burdens may be closely
balanced

Weak recommendation, best

Very weak recommendations;
Other alternatives may be
