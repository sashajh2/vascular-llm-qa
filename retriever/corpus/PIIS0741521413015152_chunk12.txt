chemia is now the most common etiology of DFUs
in most western countries. The estimated current prevalence rates of neuropathic, ischemic, and neuroischemic
ulcers in patients with diabetes are 35%, 15%, and 50%,
respectively.30
An adequate classiﬁcation system that risk stratiﬁes
patients and aids in clinical decision-making represents an
enormous unmet need in the ﬁeld of chronic limb
ischemia. While limb perfusion and arterial anatomy are
key factors in predicting amputation risk, so too are wound
depth and presence and extent of infection. The presence
of neuropathy also has an important impact on risks of
ulcer recurrence and amputation. Classiﬁcation systems
published to date have been of limited utility in clinical
decision-making because of their overly narrow focus on
speciﬁc aspects of the lower extremity at risk for amputation. TASC I,9 TASC II,31 the Bollinger32 system, and
the Graziani morphologic categorization,33 for example,
address only arterial anatomy, but fail to quantify the index
wound or baseline perfusion status. Most DFU classiﬁcations lack adequate assessment of perfusion because
ischemia is included only as a dichotomized variable (based
on a cutoff ABI of 0.8), with no gradations for severity, or
they mistakenly apply CLI hemodynamic criteria that were
never intended to be applied to patients with DFUs.34-49
The existing major wound classiﬁcation systems (Table I)
are primarily ulcer classiﬁcations, and generally do not
distinguish ulcers from gangrene. The Infectious Disease
Society of America (IDSA) clinical classiﬁcation system42,46
works well for infection, strongly correlates with amputation risk and has been validated, but does not address
wound type or perfusion status. Consequently, none of
these systems is sufﬁciently comprehensive to allow accurate, baseline patient classiﬁcation and stratiﬁcation to serve
as the foundation for subsequent comparison of outcomes
among centers, patient subgroups, and revascularization
procedures. This issue is especially important in the setting
of diabetic foot ulcers.42-60
