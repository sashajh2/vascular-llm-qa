 (>70% as
deﬁned by duplex ultrasound examination), was 11.1% at
2 years after CAS, signiﬁcantly higher than after CEA
(4.6%; P ¼ .001).465 In contrast, a secondary analysis of the
Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs Stenting
Trial (CREST) trial showed no signiﬁcant difference in
restenosis or revascularization risk at 2 or 10 years after
CAS (12.2%) and CEA (9.7%).453 The systematic review and
meta-analysis done by Kumar et al462 on restenosis after
carotid intervention and its relationship with recurrent
ipsilateral stroke showed that in 11 randomized trials
(4249 patients) of CEA that followed patients over a
mean of 47 months, the occurrence of greater than 70%
restenosis or occlusion was 5.8% (95% CI, 4.1-8.2). In ﬁve

randomized trials (1078 patients), restenosis risk of
greater than 70%/occlusion after patch CEA over a mean
of 32 months was 4.1% (95% CI, 2-8.4).462 In six randomized trials (2916 patients) over a mean follow-up of
60 months, the occurrence of restenosis greater than
70%/occlusion in patients undergoing CAS or PTA was
10.3% (95% CI, 6.0-16.4). In ﬁve trials (2,716 patients) and
over a mean follow-up of 62 months restenosis risk
greater than 70%/occlusion was 10% (95% CI, 6.0-16.3) in
patients having CAS. The same study showed that over a
mean of 50 months of surveillance, 1 of 125 CAS patients
(0.8%) with restenosis greater than 70%/occlusion suffered a
