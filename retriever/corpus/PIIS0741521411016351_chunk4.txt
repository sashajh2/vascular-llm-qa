 Joint Study on The Extracranial Circulation.1 The results of this decade-long study,
involving 5000 patients, established the role of CEA in the

and amaurosis fugax, confirmed that surgery had a limited

role in the treatment of established stroke, and established
the limited role of vertebral reconstruction in the treatment
of cerebral insufficiency. Over the ensuing decades, surgical
results of CEA improved, asymptomatic carotid stenosis
was increasingly identified by noninvasive studies, and CEA
assumed a primarily prophylactic role as prevention of
major stroke in asymptomatic patients or those with evidence of transient cerebral or ocular ischemia. Large randomized trials2-6 have established the role and efficacy of
carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in stroke prevention.
In the last decade, carotid artery stenting (CAS) has
emerged as a catheter-based alternative to CEA, and medical therapy for stroke treatment and prevention has
evolved. Currently, approximately 135,000 interventions
on lesions in the carotid bifurcation are being performed
annually in the United States, by a variety of specialists,
including vascular surgeons, general surgeons, thoracic surgeons, neurosurgeons, cardiologists, interventional radiologists, and interventional neurologists.7,8 Approximately
11% of these interventions are catheter-based, and 90% of
interventions are in patients without neurologic symptoms.7
As in any situation where there are multiple options for
the treatment of a single condition, defining optimal treatment can be difficult. This is further compounded when
multiple specialists, often with nonoverlapping expertise,
are involved in the treatment of the patient. As a result, a
voluminous and often conflicting literature has developed
around the current standards of diagnosis and management
of extracranial carotid stenosis. Recently two large, prospective, randomized trials have been published comparing
the efficacy of CEA and CAS in the management of extracranial carotid stenosis.9,10 A meta-analysis comparing
CAS and CEA, including these trials has recently been
published in the
