hetic axillary–femoral (vein) body wall access. This
prosthetic access is performed between the common femoral vein and the axillary artery using a prosthetic graft as
conduit. The common femoral vein is exposed through a
longitudinal groin incision. The axillary artery is exposed
through a transverse infraclavicular incision and is located
deep to the pectoralis major muscle. The prosthetic graft is
tunneled superficially along the body wall between the
common femoral vein and the axillary artery to perform the
two anastomoses.
