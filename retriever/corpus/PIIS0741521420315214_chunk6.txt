 identify an alternative diagnosis for symptoms and may obviate
the need for additional aortic imaging. Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low)
Recommendation 2: In patients considered at high risk
for symptomatic TAA or acute aortic syndrome, we
recommend urgent imaging, usually computed tomography angiography (CTA) because of its speed and ease
of use for preoperative planning. Magnetic resonance
angiography and transesophageal echocardiography
are also adequate for screening to identify thoracic aortic
disease but have limited applicability in certain scenarios
(discussed further later). Level of recommendation:
Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 3: For elective thoracic endovascular
aortic repair (TEVAR) cases, we suggest assessment of left
ventricular function by transthoracic echocardiography
in a patient with dyspnea of unknown origin or in a patient with known congestive heart failure with worsening
dyspnea. Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (Low)
Recommendation 4: If TEVAR is being considered, we
recommend Ô¨Åne-cut (#0.25 mm) CTA of the entire aorta
as well as of the iliac and femoral arteries. CTA of the
head and neck is also needed to determine the anatomy
of the vertebral arteries. Level of recommendation:
Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High)
Recommendation 5: We recommend routine use of
three-dimensional centerline reconstruction software

for accurate case planning and execution in TEVAR.
Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of
Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 6: We suggest contrast-enhanced
magnetic resonance angiography for preoperative planning for patients with severe allergy to iodinated contrast
material. Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (Low)
Recommendation 7: We recommend intravascular ultrasound use in TEVAR for TAA to assess landing zones
when cross-sectional imaging is of poor quality, a more
detailed evaluation of landing zones or branch vessel origins is needed, or
