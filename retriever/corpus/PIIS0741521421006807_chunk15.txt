 Rutherford grade
noted: 101, IIa; 18, IIb; 3, III)

313, Lysis (255
preoperatively); 551,
OPAR; 31, primary
amputation

Pre- and intraoperative thrombolysis
plus bypass yielded improved graft
patency rates at 1 year but no change
in amputation rates compared with
surgical thrombectomy plus bypass

Systematic review (8
prospective, 25

methodologic quality

Pulli et al,37 2013

51 Patients with ALI: 40,
Rutherford grade I-IIa; 11, IIb

Patients with I-IIa
At 48 months, limb salvage was 81.5%
received lysis then
repair (30 OPAR; 10
EPAR); patients with
IIb received OPAR

Multicenter
retrospective study;

methodologic quality

Dorigo et al,42
2002

24 Patients with ALI,
Rutherford grade I-IIa

10 Patients received
OPAR; 14, lysis
followed by OPAR

Perioperative (30-day) limb salvage was
70% for OPAR, which improved to
86% with addition of thrombolysis

Retrospective
