Recommendation 6: We suggest contrast-enhanced
magnetic resonance angiography for preoperative planning for patients with severe allergy to iodinated contrast
material. Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (Low)
Recommendation 7: We recommend intravascular ultrasound use in TEVAR for TAA to assess landing zones
when cross-sectional imaging is of poor quality, a more
detailed evaluation of landing zones or branch vessel origins is needed, or a decrease in contrast material use is
desired. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 8: As hypertension is a modiﬁable risk
factor for the development of aortic aneurysms and is associated with accelerated aortic growth and rupture, we
recommend that blood pressure be managed to the
adherence of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines.2 Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 9: We recommend interventions for
smoking cessation in patients with thoracic aortic disease as even passive exposure may increase the risk of
aortic rupture. Level of recommendation: Grade 1
(Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High)
Recommendation 10: In patients who could undergo
either technique (within the criteria of the device’s instructions for use), we recommend TEVAR as the
preferred approach to treat elective descending thoracic
aorta (DTA) aneurysms, given its reduced morbidity and
length of stay as well as short-term mortality. Level of
recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High)
Recommendation 11: We recommend TEVAR in
asymptomatic patients with a descending TAA when
the maximum aneurysm diameter exceeds 5.5 cm in
“low-risk” patients with favorable aortic anatomy. Level
of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 12: We suggest using higher aortic
diameter thresholds for TEVAR in patients deemed to
have a particularly high risk of death, renal failure, or
paraplegia from the procedure, where the beneﬁt of
treatment is lower than the risk posed by the natural history of the TAA. Level of recommendation: Grade
