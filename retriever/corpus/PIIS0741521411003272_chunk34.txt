uff compression and release of the limb distal to the point of examination.
We recommend a cutoff value of 1 second for abnormally reversed flow (reflux) in
the femoral and popliteal veins and of 500 ms for the great saphenous vein, the
small saphenous vein, the tibial, deep femoral, and the perforating veins.
We recommend that in patients with chronic venous insufficiency, duplex scanning
of the perforating veins is performed selectively. We recommend that the
definition of “pathologic” perforating veins includes those with an outward flow
of duration of ⱖ500 ms, with a diameter of ⱖ3.5 mm and a location beneath
healed or open venous ulcers (CEAP class C5-C6).

to identify pelvic venous obstruction or iliac vein stenosis in
patients with lower limb varicosity when a proximal obstruction or iliac vein compression (May-Thurner syndrome) is suspected.101 They are suitable to establish left
renal vein compression (nutcracker syndrome),102 gonadal
vein incompetence, and pelvic venous congestion syndrome. MR imaging with gadolinium is especially useful in
evaluating patients with vascular malformations, including
those with congenital varicose veins.
Intravascular ultrasonography. Intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) has been used successfully to evaluate
iliac vein compression or obstruction and to monitor patients after venous stenting.101 For patients with varicose

veins, IVUS should be used selectively in those with suspected or confirmed iliac vein obstruction. IVUS is important in assessing the morphology of the vessel wall, identifying lesions such as trabeculations, frozen valves, mural
thickness, and external compression that are not seen with
conventional contrast venography, and it provides measurements in assessing the degree of stenosis. In addition,
IVUS confirms the position of the stent in the venous
segment and the resolution of the stenosis.101
Laboratory evaluation
Patients with varicose veins are usually operated on
under local or tumescent anesthesia, and specific laboratory
