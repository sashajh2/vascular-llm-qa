omatic patients treated with CAS
compared with CEA (5.1% CAS vs 1.6% CEA; P ¼ .001).
Last, in a study by Hicks et al200 looking at almost
52,000 carotid procedures in the VQI, symptomatic
high risk patients deﬁned using Medicare criteria) had a
2.3% risk of stroke and death following CEA vs 3.6% for
CAS (P < .001). The difference in stroke was two-fold
higher for CAS in the general population as well as in
propensity-matched patient cohorts (HR, 2.23; 95% CI,
1.58-3.15; P < .001).

Transcarotid artery revascularization. Early data suggest that TCAR may have a role in treatment of patients
with symptomatic carotid occlusive disease. Numerous
studies have shown that TCAR has a similar rate of
diffusion-weighted infarcts (DWI) on postprocedure MRI
compared with CEA while transfemoral CAS is associated with a two-to three-fold higher risk of DWI. Up to
50% of DWI and strokes that occur after transfemoral
CAS are contralateral, suggesting arch pathology as the
etiology. In two recently completed trials, Safety and Efﬁcacy Study for Reverse Flow Used during CAS Procedure (ROADSTER-1) and (ROADSTER-2), the risk of
periprocedural stroke in symptomatic patients from the
two trials combined was 0.6% while mortality risk was
0.6% for a combined risk of stroke and death of
1.2%.177,178 A more recent study comparing TCAR and
transfemoral CAS examined 1829 propensity scorematched patients from the VQI with symptomatic carotid disease. This study demonstrated that TCAR was
associated with signiﬁcantly lower risk of in-hospital
stroke or death compared with transfemoral CAS (2.1%
vs 4.2%; absolute difference, 2.02% [95% CI, 3.21%
to 0.83%]; RR, 0.51 [95
