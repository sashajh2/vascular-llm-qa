 been conﬁrmed in other reports.39-41 Increasing risk
has also been noted with increased salt intake,42 high
blood pressure, concomitant peripheral arterial disease
and cerebrovascular disease, and family history of AAA
(Table II).33
Given the prevalence of AAA-related risk factors in the
United States, the prevalence of AAA, as deﬁned by an

aortic diameter >3 cm, was estimated at 1.4% among
those between 50 and 84 years old, or 1.1 million adults.
Importantly, these ﬁndings largely concur with and
expand on prior prevalence and association estimates
derived from more homogeneous populations, such as
male military veterans.43 First-degree relatives of patients
with an AAA have an approximately 20% likelihood for
development of an AAA.44,45
The association between cigarette smoking and AAA
disease deserves special emphasis.46 More than 90% of
patients with AAA have smoked cigarettes at some point
in their lifetime, and AAA is second only to lung cancer in
epidemiologic association to cigarette smokingdmore
closely associated than either cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease.47 For patients with early aneurysmal
disease, a recent meta-analysis concluded that smoking
increased the rate of aneurysm enlargement by 35%.9
Current smokers are more than seven times more likely
to have an aneurysm than nonsmokers, with duration
of smoking the most important variable. Each year of
smoking increases the relative risk for development of
an aneurysm by 4%.48 The decades-long decline in per
