2 cm of the SFJ. Four aneurysms were surgically
excised, with proximal ligation, because they were
located near the SFJ and had a diameter >3 cm. The
other 11 were treated with endovenous ablation alone.
A generous amount of tumescent anesthesia was
used to diminish the aneurysm as much as possible.
Additional energy was applied in the aneurysmal
segment, either 100 Joules/cm for EVLA or 3 energy cycles for RFA. No patient had DVT or thrombus extension into the femoral vein. At 1 year, none of the
aneurysms were visible on duplex. Three patients
needed retreatment for partial or segmental recanalization, with good result. Thromboprophylaxis was given to
patients with a history of VTE or SVT.
Further experience with larger number of patients is
needed to recommend endovenous ablation alone for
treatment of large
aneurysms or
for those
located <3 cm to the SFJ or SPJ. One of the main reasons
for this study is that current North American guidelines
suggest placement of the tip of thermal ablation catheters $2 cm distal to the SFJ.
15. Future research
The writing committee of the Varicose Veins Guidelines identiﬁed several gaps in our knowledge on the
natural history, evaluation, prevention and treatment
of patients with varicose veins. Table XXV includes
the top 20 recommended topics on future research
on varicose veins, in order of importance.
