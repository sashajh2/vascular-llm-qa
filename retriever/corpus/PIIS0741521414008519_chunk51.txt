ness, fatigue, and restless legs. Venous symptoms
are usually exacerbated by limb dependency and relieved by
rest or elevation. Medical history should also include risk
factor assessment for venous disease, including age, body
mass index, prior venous thromboembolism, family history
of venous thromboembolism, family history of varicose
veins, episodes of superﬁcial thrombophlebitis, spontaneous venous rupture, prior use of compression therapy,
prior venous operative interventions, use of venotonic
medications, presence of other systemic diseases associated
with leg wounds, and other possible associated medical factors that may contribute to nonhealing leg wounds. Physical examination for signs of venous disease should include
inspection for telangiectasia, varicose veins, edema, chronic
venous skin changes (skin discoloration, inﬂammation,
eczema, hyperpigmentation, malleolar ﬂair, corona phlebectatica, atrophie blanche, lipodermatosclerosis), healed
ulcer, and active ulcer; palpation for varicosity, palpable
venous cord, tenderness, induration, edema, and pulses;
auscultation for bruit and reﬂux; and evaluation of ankle
mobility.92-96

Guideline 3.2: Nonvenous Causes of Leg Ulcers
We recommend identiﬁcation of medical conditions
that affect ulcer healing and other nonvenous causes of
ulcers. [BEST PRACTICE]

Differentiation of venous from nonvenous leg ulcers
is important before initiation of therapy. In a deﬁned
Swedish population, prevalence of active leg ulcers was
0.31%, with 54% classiﬁed as venous and 46% nonvenous.97 In a population-based study from Germany
including 31,619 patients, venous reﬂux was the causative
factor in 47.6%, arterial insufﬁciency in 14.5%, and combined arterial and venous reﬂux in 17.6%. Rarer causes
included vasculitis (5.1%), exogenous factors (3.8%), pyoderma gangrenosum (3.0%), infection (1.4%),
