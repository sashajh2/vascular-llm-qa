Guideline 3.7: Arterial Testing
We recommend arterial pulse examination and
measurement of ankle-brachial index on all patients
with venous leg ulcer. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE - B]
Because adequate arterial perfusion is needed for
improved healing, it is important to identify the presence
of underlying peripheral arterial disease (PAD).137,138
Approximately 15% to 25% of patients with VLUs will
have a concomitant PAD component.97,98,139,140 Evaluation of possible risk factors for PAD includes male gender,
age, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes,
obesity, coexisting cardiovascular disease, stroke, renal
insufﬁciency, hyperhomocysteinemia, and family history
of cardiovascular disease. Symptoms and signs of PAD
include claudication, rest pain, and ischemic ulceration or
necrosis. Key components of the physical examination
include measurement of blood pressure in both arms, cardiac auscultation, leg examination (changes in color, skin
temperature, muscle atrophy, decreased hair growth, hypertrophied nails), and complete pulse examination (palpation for aneurysms; auscultation for bruits in carotid, aorta,
or femoral region; palpation of the radial, ulnar, brachial,
carotid, femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior
tibial artery pulse). Lower extremity Doppler examination
is standard for patients with suspected PAD. Measurement
of ankle-brachial index (ABI) is performed in the supine
position with a sphygmomanometer cuff placed just above
the ankle and a continuous-wave Doppler probe used to
measure the systolic pressure of the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries of each leg, which is then normalized to
the higher brachial pressure of either to calculate the ABI for
each leg. ABI is calculated by dividing the systolic ankle pressure by systolic arm pressure. The reproducibility of the ABI
varies, but it is signiﬁcant enough that reporting standards
require a change of 0.15 in an isolated measurement for it
to be considered clinically relevant or >0
