has also improved, and the use of generic and diseasespeciﬁc quality of life (QoL) instruments has become the
reference standard for outcomes assessment.17-19
In 2011, the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the
American Venous Forum (AVF) published the ﬁrst
evidence-based guidelines on “the care of patients with
varicose veins and associated chronic venous diseases.”20
With the improvement of imaging studies and minimally
invasive technology, the method has also improved,
enabling the reporting of guidelines that incorporate
new indications and technology. Several new venous clinical practice guidelines were published during the past
decade, with the recommendations updated as new evidence emerged.21-27 To collect the latest evidence on the
evaluation and management of patients with CEAP class
C2 varicose veins, the American Vein and Lymphatic Society joined the SVS and AVF and commissioned an independent health science group to perform a new
systematic review and meta-analysis.19 All recommendations in part I of the present clinical practice guideline
were determined from the scientiﬁc evidence provided
by the systematic review and meta-analysis.

METHODS
All treatment recommendations are in accordance with
the GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment,
development, and evaluation) method.28,29 This approach
has been outlined in previous SVS guideline documents
and includes two components.28 The ﬁrst component is
to determine the quality of the evidence underlying the
recommendation (A, high; B, moderate; C, low to very
low), and the second is to determine the strength of the
recommendation (1, strong; 2, weak).
The ﬁrst component of the GRADE system is to determine the quality of the evidence (A-C) as a reﬂection of
the degree of conﬁdence in the estimated treatment effect. Rating the quality of the evidence (also termed the
certainty of evidence) as A, B, or C starts with the study
design. Because they are less subject to bias, RCTs will
have the highest level of evidence, with other sources of
evidence, such as observational studies, ranked lower in
the hierarchy. This rating can be downgraded when (1)
