 reported virtually no infectious wound
complications.179,180
Percutaneous access of the common femoral artery for
TEVAR is also a common approach to access and is
increasing in frequency as surgeons become more
comfortable with it.181 A discussion of the pitfalls and
merits of individual closure devices is beyond the scope
of this document. However, several techniques have
been described for identiﬁcation of the femoral artery,
including access through a small transverse incision182,183
and ultrasound guidance,184,185 with reported success
rates ranging from 92% to 96%. Ultrasound guidance
has become a standard component of percutaneous
endovascular access at most institutions as it helps the
operator identify and avoid anatomic factors that could
lead to failure of closure, such as coursing through the
inguinal ligament or calcium on the anterior wall of the
artery. One study reported that the use of ultrasound
led to a 10-fold increase in successful percutaneous
EVAR procedures compared with those performed
without ultrasound (P ¼ .03).186
A meta-analysis performed of 3606 percutaneous arterial access attempts for endovascular aortic repair
included 469 percutaneous TEVAR procedures. The overall technical success rate was 94% per arterial access and
the groin complication rate was 3.6%, with only 1.6% of
patients requiring open repair of the groin.187 The most
common complication was groin hematoma (1.8%), followed by pseudoaneurysm (0.7%). Factors that improved
successful percutaneous access included ultrasound
guidance (96.4% with ultrasound vs 93.5% without; P ¼
.02) and a sheath size <20F (94.2% <20F vs 88.7%
$20F; P < .001).187 Other anatomic factors that have
been associated with improved success with a percutaneous approach include a >1-cm segment of mid common femoral artery without anterior calciﬁcation,
