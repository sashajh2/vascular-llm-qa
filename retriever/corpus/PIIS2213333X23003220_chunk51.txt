Evidence. The efﬁcacy and safety of VADs was extensively studied in patients with CVD in double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials and meta-analyses.
There have been two Cochrane reviews, the most recent
in 2020, that included a systematic review and metaanalysis of 7690 patients, enrolled in 56 studies.104,105
The VAD used included rutosides, hidrosmine and diosmin, calcium dobesilate, Centella asiatica, aminaftone,

French maritime pine bark extract, and grape seed
extract. Diosmin is only one component of MPFF, and
MPFF studies were analyzed together with nonmicronized diosmin trials. Most studies included patients
with varicose veins (C2), but also with more advanced
CVI, like venous edema (C3), skin changes (C4-C5), venous
ulcers (C6). Pooled data analysis of VADs was given,
although the document also includes breakdown of the
different effect of individual products as well. The number of patients included in many studies was low and the
