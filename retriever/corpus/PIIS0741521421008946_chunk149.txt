Restenosis after CEA
Recurrent carotid artery stenosis following CEA is reported to occur in 5% to 22% of patients.417 However,
very few (3%) of these recurrent stenoses are symptomatic, and few typically require reintervention.417,453-455 As
reported in the CREST study, the risk of signiﬁcant restenosis or occlusion was 6.3% at 2 years.453
Recurrent stenosis is more likely to occur in certain
patient subgroups, including women, active smokers,
patients who undergo initial endarterectomy at a
young age, and in patients with hypercholesterolemia,
diabetes, and hypertension.455-458 Additionally, some
technical factors at the time of the initial CEA may
contribute to the development of residual stenosis or
subsequent restenosis. These include clamp injury,
use of an intraluminal shunt, or placement of tacking
sutures at the distal end point of the endarterectomy
site.459
With regard to decreasing the incidence of signiﬁcant
restenosis, there are signiﬁcant data in the literature to
substantiate a recommendation for patch angioplasty
or eversion endarterectomy over standard endarterectomy with primary closure of the artery.3 A metaanalysis of randomized trials comparing bovine pericardium and other patch materials for CEA did not ﬁnd
any signiﬁcant differences in the rates of late restenosis.310 A systematic review of randomized controlled trials
of patch angioplasty vs primary closure found that patch
angioplasty seemed to decrease the risk of perioperative
death or stroke, late ipsilateral stroke, and late recurrent
stenosis.269

Recurrent stenosis after CEA seems to have two distinct
patterns of presentation. Early recurrent stenosis usually
develops within two years of primary CEA and typically
results from neointimal hyperplasia.3,417,455 This usually
develops at the site of endarterectomy and is felt to
