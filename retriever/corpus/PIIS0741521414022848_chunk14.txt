Summary of evidence: Diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease (PAD)

Clinical question
Accuracy of ABI in
patients suspected
to have PAD
Accuracy of anatomic
imaging studies and
physiologic
noninvasive studies
in patients suspected
to have PAD

Beneﬁts and harms
of screening
asymptomatic
individuals with ABI
Incremental value of
adding ABI to
traditional risk
assessment tools
(Framingham risk
assessment)

Quality of
evidence

Data source

Finding

Multiple nonrandomized
diagnostic studies with
comparison with the gold
standard
Nonrandomized diagnostic
studies with comparison
with the gold standard

ABI <0.9 has a sensitivity ranging from 79% to
95% with a speciﬁcity of >95%43

A-B

The combination of segmental limb pressures and
pulse volume recordings had a diagnostic
accuracy of 97%.44 Duplex ultrasound imaging
to detect a stenosis $50% in the aortoiliac tract:
sensitivity, 86%; speciﬁcity, 97%; for the
femoropopliteal tract: sensitivity, 80%; speciﬁcity,
96%; for the infragenicular arteries: sensitivity,
83%; speciﬁcity, 84%.45 Accuracy of CT and MR
imaging were >90%46,47
No data on beneﬁt or harm in patient-important
outcomes48

Reclassiﬁcation of risk and change in treatment
recommendations in w19% of men and 36% of
women49

C

No data

Meta-analysis of cohort
studies. Evidence is
considered indirect
because risk score is a
surrogate outcome

ABI, Ankle-brachial index; CT, computed tomography; MR, magnetic resonance.
3. MANAGEMENT OF ASYMPTOMATIC
PATIENTS WITH PAD
The incidence of asymptomatic PAD in the U.S. population is substantial, extends across gender and race divisions,
and may be readily conﬁrmed by use of the ABI.11,50 An
important question is whether identiﬁ
