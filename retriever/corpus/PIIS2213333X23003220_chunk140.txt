Judgment

How substantial are desirable
effects of the strategy?

Application of compression for one week after any
endothermal ablation with and without concomitant
phlebectomies appeared to be effective in reducing pain
within the ﬁrst 5-10 days after endothermal ablation and
phlebectomies with the greatest beneﬁts in patients
undergoing EVLA. Earlier return to daily activities was also
observed.

Probably yes

How substantial are the undesirable
anticipated effects?

Reported side effects of discomfort, appearance, and
application difﬁculty. The beneﬁts of stockings can be offset
by highly variable reports of compliance, presumably due to
the most common side effects of itching and irritation.

Probably yes

Do the desirable effects outweigh
the undesirable effects?

Probably not

DVT, and pulmonary embolism (PE) being 1.3% to
1.7%.234-236 Given this low incidence, the potential

magnitude of effect of any intervention such as routine
ultrasound surveillance after venous ablation would be
classiﬁed as “trivial” to “small” (<5 events per 1000
