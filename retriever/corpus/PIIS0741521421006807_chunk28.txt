 accomplished by
sealing off the aneurysm with an endograft. Although
a paucity of adequately powered level 1 prospective
data is available comparing these two modalities,
several studies have reported better long-term outcomes (ie, better patency and fewer major adverse
limb events) after OPAR, especially if a single-segment
GSV was used for the arterial bypass.32,34-39 Given these
observations regarding the better long-term results, for
patients who can tolerate either procedure with an

anticipated life expectancy of $5 years, OPAR should
be considered ﬁrst if adequate GSV is available. An
adequate GSV has been extrapolated from PAD studies
to be a GSV >3 mm in diameter and free of intraluminal
stenoses or synechiae.
In the absence of an adequate single-segment GSV, an
alternative conduit such as an expanded polytetraﬂuoroethylene graft can be used with acceptable outcomes.58
An alternative autogenous vein may not provide better
long-term patency outcomes than an expanded polytetraﬂuoroethylene conduit.59 The latter, using a posterior
approach, often allows for a good size match for proximal and distal popliteal arteries in this patient
population.60
Several studies that retrospectively compared the results of different PAA interventions have indicated that
the number of tibial runoff vessels will affect the surgical
outcomes. These studies suggested that the number of
outﬂow arteries could adversely affect the results of
EPAR but not OPAR.31,32 In a recent large study of the
long-term results of EPAR, the investigators found that
aneurysm size, coverage below the knee, and singlevessel runoff were the only predictors of major adverse
limb events.61 Therefore, given the current data, for patients with poor tibial or pedal runoff, OPAR with GSV
is considered preferential to EPAR for good-risk patients. High-risk patients, deﬁned as those with a high
cardiovascular risk or adverse anatomic criteria such as
severe venous stasis or lymphedema, pose a challenge
because the natural history of PAA is known only from
purely retrospective data. As such, for patients with a
poor life expectancy
