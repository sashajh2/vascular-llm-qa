R), EVAR is not
without risk of complications. EVAR may be complicated by injury to access vessels such as
femoral occlusion or iliac avulsion (aka, “iliac-on-a-stick”), wire trauma from the relatively
stiff wires that are used to deliver the stent graft, rupture of the aneurysm, and endoleak.
Endoleak is the term used to describe ongoing blood fow in the aneurysm sac after stent graft
placement (e.g. from lumbar arteries or the inferior mesenteric artery, inadequate proximal or
distal endograft seal, a defect in the endograft, etc.). There are various types of endoleak and
each has its own management approach.
Endoleaks are classified as follows:
 Type Ia: caused by an improper proximal endograft seal (i.e. the top of the graft is not
well opposed to the abdominal aorta and blood can fow around it into the aneurysm
sac).
 Type Ib: caused by an improper distal endograft seal (i.e. the distal iliac limb is not
well opposed to the iliac artery and blood can fow retrograde into the aneurysm sac).
 Type II: caused by retrograde blood fow into the aneurysm sac from aortic side branches
such as lumbar arteries or the IMA. This is the most common type and does not require
intervention provided a stable aneurysm sac size is observed on follow-up. If the sac continues to expand, the feeding vessels may need to be occluded via embolization (e.g. coil
embolization).
 Type III: caused by a defect in the endograft such as a fabric tear, or disconnection of
the contralateral iliac limb from the main body of the graft.
 Type IV: caused by graft wall porosity. To explain graft wall porosity, imagine filling
up a pillowcase with water. Even if the pillowcase has the tightest of weaves, eventually,
water will leak through the pillowcase.
 Type V: increase in aneurysm size with no identifiable cause.
