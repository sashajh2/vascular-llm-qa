 on low quality evidence, data demonstrating increased likelihood of PAD in those with weak
or absent pulses and elevated risk of cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality support the preference of a person with diabetes for clinical examination including
pulse palpation to be performed.5,35 The non-invasive nature of clinical examination and pulse palpation suggest
that these assessments would be valued by people with
diabetes as initial diagnostic tests. As equipment is not
required, the Writing Committee considered pulse
palpation and other forms of clinical examination as having low resource requirements, which can be applied on
a broad scale by a range of practitioners, and offer a
method to increase equity of healthcare access that is
both feasible for healthcare providers and acceptable
for people with diabetes. This Strong Recommendation
is therefore made, based on low certainty of evidence
and expert opinion.
Bedside testing techniques that provide objective measurement of peripheral blood ﬂow in the lower extremity
(e.g., ankle brachial index [ABI], toe brachial index [TBI],
and pedal Doppler waveforms) have been shown to be
useful to diagnose and exclude PAD in people with diabetes. The systematic review demonstrates that multiple
bedside testing techniques that offer objective measurement of the peripheral circulation in the lower limb are
useful as a means to rule disease in or out for people
with diabetes without a DFU but who are suspected of
having PAD.5
Forty studies investigating the diagnostic accuracy of
non-invasive bedside tests in populations with diabetes
were identiﬁed.5 Twenty eight of the studies used prospective recruitment and the remainder were retrospective. Overall, the studies were of low quality and evidence
was judged as being of low certainty. Although it was not
possible to identify the absolute threshold or normal
values of bedside tests, it is suggested that PAD is more
likely to be present in this population with an ABI < 0.9
or > 1.3, a TBI < 0.70, and presence of one or more monophasic Doppler waveforms from assessment of pedal arteries with continuous wave Doppler (CWD).5 In people
without DFU, an ABI of < 0.90 is associated with a moderate to large increase in likelihood of PAD with PLRs
