 with signiﬁcant functional or
lifestyle-limiting disability when there is a reasonable likelihood of symptomatic improvement
with treatment, when pharmacologic or exercise therapy, or both, have failed, and when the
beneﬁts of treatment outweigh the potential risks.
We recommend an individualized approach to select an invasive treatment for IC. The modality
offered should provide a reasonable likelihood of sustained beneﬁt to the patient (>50%
likelihood of clinical efﬁcacy for at least 2 years). For revascularization, anatomic patency
(freedom from hemodynamically signiﬁcant restenosis) is considered a prerequisite for sustained
efﬁcacy.

may be justiﬁed is to provide vascular access for another
indicated cardiovascular implant (eg, thoracic endovascular
aortic repair, endovascular aneurysm repair, transcatheter
aortic valve replacement, mechanical circulatory support).
Surgical options for AIOD include direct aortic reconstructions (aortofemoral bypass [AFB], aortoiliac bypass,
aortoiliac endarterectomy), which have proven to be
most durable but also have signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality. In patients with suitable anatomy or those deemed to
be at high risk for aortic surgery, or both, extra-anatomic
bypasses (axillary-femoral [AxFB], iliac-femoral [IFB],
femoral-femoral bypass [FFB]) are less morbid alternatives
but are also less durable.
A tremendous paradigm shift has occurred in the last two
decades in the treatment of AIOD.134 Although intersocietal
guidelines previously recommended endovascular procedures as primary treatment for more focal disease and traditional surgery for more diffuse disease,9,135 improvements in
technology and endovascular techniques have resulted in
EVT replacing open surgical bypass as a primary treatment
for both focal and advanced AIOD in many cases. For iliac
angioplasty using stents, long-term results compare favorably
with open surgery.135-139 Other techniques, including devices for crossing long-segment total occlusions,140 stent
