From Vasquez MA, Rabe E, McLafferty RB, Shortell CK, Marston WA, Gillespie D, Meissner MH, Rutherford RB; American Venous Forum Ad Hoc
Outcomes Working Group. Revision of the venous clinical severity score: venous outcomes consensus statement: special communication of the
American Venous Forum Ad Hoc Outcomes Working Group. J Vasc Surg. 2010 Nov; 52(5):1387-96. AVF Document, with permission.

Consensus statements.
1.5.1. In asymptomatic patients with telangiectasias
or reticular veins (CEAP Class C1), DUS evaluation of
the lower extremity veins should not be performed
routinely because testing could result in unnecessary
saphenous vein ablation procedures.

Rationale. Asymptomatic CEAP Class C1 venous disorder
is usually a cosmetic problem; asymptomatic telangiectasias or reticular veins should not be treated for the purpose
of preventing progression to more advanced venous disease.
Saphenous vein ablation is not indicated in these patients for
medical reasons. The GSV may need to be used in the future
