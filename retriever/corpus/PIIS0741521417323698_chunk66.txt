Recommendations for aneurysm surveillance. Surveillance imaging should use ultrasound examinations
unless other imaging modalities are speciﬁcally indicated. The optimal frequency for surveillance after recognition of early-stage AAA disease has not been deﬁned
by randomized clinical study. Some authors have suggested that there is no need to observe patients with an
initial aortic diameter <3 cm, given their low risk for
rupture.248,269 However, in a 12-year analysis of 1121 men
65 years of age or older, 13.8% of aortas with an initial
diameter of 2.6 to 2.9 cm exceeded 5.5 cm at 10 years.
Among patients with an aortic diameter between 3.0
and 3.4 cm, 2.1% had reached 5.5 cm at 3 years; and of
those with a diameter between 3.5 and 3.9 cm, 10.5%
exceeded 5.5 cm or required surgery within 2 years.
Rupture occurred in 1.4%.
Two randomized controlled trials, the UKSAT270 and the
U.S. Veterans Affairs ADAM trial,271 as well as a follow-up
study of patients detected in the U.K. MASS trial246
demonstrated that a policy of surveillance until aneurysm
diameter exceeds 5.5 cm is safe and associated with a
rupture rate of 1% per year. Whereas aortic size was
deﬁned by the maximum external aortic diameter, the
surveillance frequency differed among these studies.
In an analysis of expansion rates of 1743 participants
in the UKSAT, AAA growth rate increased with
