FA to the aboveknee or below-knee popliteal artery, and the conduits were
ipsilateral reversed saphenous vein in >90% of the procedures.
Anastomotic sites and conduits largely mimicked those most
used in vein grafts performed for claudication, even though
two-thirds of the procedures in VGST were for CLI. A comparison of the two surveillance strategies at 18 months found no
differences in primary, primary assisted, or secondary patency.
A smaller study from Sweden randomized 156 patients
with lower extremity arterial reconstructions to intensive
surveillance to include DUS (n ¼ 79) vs routine clinical
surveillance (n ¼ 77).247 Forty grafts, equally distributed
between the two groups, were PTFE grafts. Only two
grafts in each group were performed for claudication, and
two-thirds of the grafts were performed to the popliteal
artery. Among the vein grafts in the study there was
improved assisted primary and secondary patency in the
intensive surveillance group that included DUS.
Many single-institution series and one large prospective
multi-institution series demonstrated improved vein graft
patency for patients treated for CLI with a surveillance
program using duplex ultrasound detection of graft stenoses.248-252 In addition to a signiﬁcant improvement in primary and assisted primary patency of vein grafts monitored
with a DUS-based program, these studies and others have
demonstrated revised grafts have excellent long-term
patency comparable to grafts never undergoing revision.253,254 None of the studies included patients treated
for claudication. Whether the magnitude of the beneﬁt of
improved graft patency achieved in CLI patients, followed
with duplex-based surveillance, would be comparable in patients undergoing vein bypass for claudication remains unknown. Nevertheless, the signiﬁcance and consistency of
evidence demonstrating beneﬁt for a DUS-based program
for lower extremity vein grafts done for CLI infers some
beneﬁt would be derived for grafts performed for claudication,

especially during the ﬁrst year after the bypass, although the
strength of the evidence is weak. Opt
