 iliac arteries, or occlusion of the
external iliac artery alone, may be approached surgically with
either in-line (unilateral AFB or IFB) or extra-anatomic
(FFB or AxFB) strategies. The choice between these depends
on patient risk, status of the contralateral iliofemoral system
and contralateral groin, and suitability of the proximal common iliac or aorta for inﬂow anastomosis. The presence of
pre-existing stents or stent grafts in any of these segments
will also inﬂuence the choice and conduct of the procedure.
As noted above, the presence and severity of CFA disease
is a critical point that often dictates whether a purely endovascular vs an open surgical or hybrid approach is undertaken.
Long-term outcomes and limb status after reconstructions
for AIOD are highly dependent on continued patency of
the CFAs and deep femoral arteries (DFAs).171,172 The presence of FP and distal occlusive disease is also common, particularly in smokers. For patients with disabling claudication and
rest pain (Rutherford 2-4), inﬂow reconstruction of signiﬁcant AIOD is frequently all that is required to improve symptoms. A staged approach is therefore recommended in such
patients with multilevel disease, with re-evaluation of symptom status after inﬂow correction.
Direct (in-line) aortofemoral and iliofemoral
reconstruction. Direct surgical revascularization for
AIOD is often considered the gold standard for durable
vascular interventions, with patency rates >80% at 10 years
for AFB or aortoiliac endarterectomy.145,173,174 Patency
rates for unilateral IFB are also typically in the range of 90%
at 3 to 5 years.166,175-178 The disease pattern most
amenable to endarterectomy (ie, localized lesions in the
terminal aorta and common iliacs) is readily treated by

20S Conte and Pomposelli et al

endovascular means; hence, this operation has become
extremely uncommon in current practice.
Transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approaches may be
used without signiﬁcant differences in outcomes.
