Both open surgical stripping and the currently available
endovenous procedures are durable procedures. The 5year results from the CLASS study conﬁrmed the equally
improved disease-speciﬁc QoL in both the surgery and
the laser groups and both were superior to the results after physician-compounded foam.10 Using a probabilistic
cost-effectiveness model iteration, their results favored
laser ablation over foam ablation. When the main
outcome measure was the occlusion rate of the treated
GSV, the 5-year results were similar after high ligation
and saphenous stripping and EVLA (96% vs 89%) but
signiﬁcantly worse after UGFS (51%; P < .001).10 A metaanalysis of nine RCTs by Kheirelseid et al37 showed that
at 5 years RFA and EVLA are as effective as surgery for
treating saphenous vein insufﬁciency. The study also
concluded that the number of patients available for
analysis was too small to draw any deﬁnite conclusions.37
Similarly, an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
systematic review found either no difference or insufﬁcient data to support differences in important longterm patient outcomes between thermal ablation and
surgery.152
Guideline 2.3.
2.3.1. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the GSV or SSV, we recommend
treatment with ligation and stripping of the saphenous vein if the technology or expertise in endovenous
ablation is not available or the venous anatomy precludes endovenous treatment.

Level of recommendation: grade 1 (strong), quality of
evidence: B (moderate)
2.3.2. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the AAGSV or PAGSV, we suggest
treatment with ligation and stripping of the accessory
GSV, with additional phlebectomy, if needed, if the
technology or expertise in endovenous ablation is not
available or the venous anatomy precludes endovenous treatment.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak),
