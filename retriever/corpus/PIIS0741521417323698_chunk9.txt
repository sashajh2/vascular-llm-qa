preoperatively with continuation of aspirin. The P2Y12 inhibitor should be restarted as soon as possible after surgery. The relative risks and beneﬁts of perioperative
bleeding and stent thrombosis should be discussed with
the patient.

We recommend preoperative hydration in nondialysisdependent patients with renal insufﬁciency before aneurysm repair.

We suggest continuation of beta blocker therapy during the perioperative period if it is part of an established
medical regimen.

B (Moderate)

If a decision was made to start beta blocker therapy
(because of the presence of multiple risk factors, such
as coronary artery disease, renal insufﬁciency, and diabetes), we suggest initiation well in advance of surgery
to allow sufﬁcient time to assess safety and tolerability.

We suggest preoperative pulmonary function studies,
including room air arterial blood gas determinations, in
patients with a history of symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), long-standing tobacco
use, or inability to climb one ﬂight of stairs.

We recommend smoking cessation for at least 2 weeks
before aneurysm repair.

We suggest administration of pulmonary bronchodilators for at least 2 weeks before aneurysm repair in patients with a history of COPD or abnormal results of
pulmonary function testing.

We suggest holding angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists
on the morning of surgery and restarting these agents
after the procedure once euvolemia has been achieved.

We recommend preprocedure and postprocedure hydration with normal saline or 5% dextrose/sodium bicarbonate for patients at increased risk of contrast-induced
nephropathy (CIN) undergoing EV
