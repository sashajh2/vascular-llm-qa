s were to fail. However, the longterm outcomes comparing the SMA alone and SMA/celiac bypasses have been equivocal, further underscoring
the importance of the SMA as the deﬁnitive target.7,157

There are reports of patients undergoing revascularization of the IMA96 and branches of the SMA158 for CMI,
although these options should be reserved for select patients who are not candidates for the more standard
options.
Although the guidelines are directed at the management of patients with CMI, a moderate percentage of patients will present with progression of their symptoms (ie,
acute-on-chronic disease), with an even smaller percentage having bowel infarction with perforation. The management principles include resection of the frankly
necrotic bowel, reassessment of the marginal bowel after
revascularization, autogenous vascular reconstruction,
the avoidance of primary bowel anastomoses in the
setting of ischemia, and liberal use of a second-look
laparotomy.
The perioperative management of patients undergoing
open revascularization for CMI is comparable with that
for patients undergoing other open aortic procedures.
The obligatory ischemia/reperfusion injury can lead to
multiple organ dysfunction with respiratory, renal, hepatic, and hematologic insufﬁciency.157,159 The optimal treatment regimen includes simply supportive care until the
end-organ failure resolves. The clinical sequelae of the
ischemia/reperfusion injury can mimic graft thrombosis
and AMI, underscoring the importance of conﬁrming
that the bypass grafts are patent with the appropriate
imaging when in question. The return of bowel function
is commonly delayed and may necessitate the temporary use of parenteral nutrition. A small percentage of patients will develop prolonged diarrhea requiring home
parenteral nutrition.157
Similar to the patients undergoing endovascular revascularization, patients should be maintained on antiplatelet agents and a statin.139 A completion imaging study
should be performed intraoperatively at the time of the
procedure and/or before discharge to conﬁrm the technical adequacy of the procedure and to serve as a baseline. Technical defects have been identiﬁed in up to 15%
of the procedures with a low rate of graft failure among
normal studies.160 Identiﬁcation and correction of
