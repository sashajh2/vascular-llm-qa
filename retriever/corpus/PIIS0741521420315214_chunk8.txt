 with favorable aortic anatomy. Level
of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 12: We suggest using higher aortic
diameter thresholds for TEVAR in patients deemed to
have a particularly high risk of death, renal failure, or
paraplegia from the procedure, where the beneﬁt of
treatment is lower than the risk posed by the natural history of the TAA. Level of recommendation: Grade 2
(Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low)
Recommendation 13: Because of the dynamic nature
of isolated intramural hematoma (IMH) and its known
association with aortic dissection, we recommend close
observation and hypertension control with follow-up imaging as the initial management of patients with asymptomatic IMH. Level of recommendation: Grade 1
(Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)

Recommendation 14: We recommend TEVAR in patients with IMH or penetrating aortic ulcer who have
persistent symptoms or complications or show evidence
of disease progression on follow-up imaging after a
period of hypertension control. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 15: We suggest TEVAR in selected
cases of asymptomatic penetrating aortic ulcer in patients who have at-risk characteristics for growth or
rupture. Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 16: We suggest TEVAR for symptomatic mycotic/infected TAA as a temporizing measure, but
data demonstrating long-term beneﬁt are lacking. Level
of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low)
Recommendation 17: We recommend increasing
perfusion pressure through controlled hypertension
(mean arterial pressure >90 mm Hg) as a component
of a spinal cord protection protocol in patients at high
risk of spinal cord injury because of extensive coverage
length (>15 cm), poor hypogastric perfusion (occluded
or signiﬁcantly stenosed hypogastric arteries), or
coverage of important collaterals (subclavian/hypogastric
arteries). Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 18: We
