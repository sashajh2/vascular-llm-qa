 available on the beneﬁts of screening
regarding the actual outcomes of future stroke. The
rationale behind screening for asymptomatic disease
has been determined by the assumptions that unheralded stroke is often the ﬁrst symptom of signiﬁcant carotid atherosclerosis and that the medical, surgical, or
endovascular treatment of identiﬁed severe carotid artery stenosis can prevent future cerebral infarction. The
efﬁcacy of screening is directly related to the prevalence
of disease in the designated population. Screening has
been found to reduce the risk of stroke in a costeffective manner when the prevalence of signiﬁcant stenosis is $20%.68 However, with a prevalence of <5% in
the general population,68,69 screening does not appear
to reduce the stroke risk and might, in fact, be harmful
if it leads to inappropriately performed invasive procedures. In addition, the rate of false-positive carotid Duplex
ultrasound ﬁndings could be increased in a population
with such a low prevalence of disease.70 Because of the
relatively low prevalence of disease, widespread
screening of the general population, therefore, is clearly
not indicated. This position is supported by multiple professional organizations, including the National Stroke Association, Canadian Stroke Consortium,71,72 and the U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force.70
Recommendation 4.1: We recommend against the
routine screening for clinically asymptomatic carotid
artery stenosis for individuals without cerebrovascular
symptoms or signiﬁcant risk factors for carotid artery
disease (grade IB).

Therefore, speciﬁc high-risk asymptomatic populations
have been proposed as appropriate for carotid screening.
The American Stroke Association/American Heart Association Stroke Council concluded that screening of
highly selected populations might be of beneﬁt.73 Multiple societies, including the American College of Cardiology Foundation and others, have recommended
screening for asymptomatic patients with a carotid bruit
found on physical examination and for those for whom
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is planned.74 The
SVS has advocated for consideration of carotid artery
screening of high-risk patients aged $55 years with cardiovascular risk factors.75
