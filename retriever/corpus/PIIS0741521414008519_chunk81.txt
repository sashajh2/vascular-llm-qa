Guideline 4.17: Anti-inﬂammatory Therapies
We suggest against use of anti-inﬂammatory therapies for the treatment of venous leg ulcers. [GRADE 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Although a signiﬁcant body of research has identiﬁed
that VLUs are associated with signiﬁcant upregulation of
inﬂammatory cytokines and proteases,71,83,253 there is a
lack of data identifying that any anti-inﬂammatory dressing
other than compression is associated with accelerated healing of VLUs.254
Adjunctive Wound Therapies
Guideline 4.18: Indications for Adjuvant Therapies
We recommend adjuvant wound therapy options for
venous leg ulcers that fail to demonstrate improvement
after a minimum of 4 to 6 weeks of standard wound
therapy. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Adjunctive therapies for the healing of VLUs should be
considered after all standard of care measures have been
implemented. Comprehensive care should include compression therapy, local wound débridement, control of bioburden, wound moisture balance with appropriate
dressings, and consideration of the use of pentoxifylline. After a minimum of 4 to 6 weeks of appropriate care, a
decrease in wound dimensions should be noted. Standard
of care for VLUs will lead to improvement in the majority
of cases, and only in those cases without improvement
should adjunctive modalities be used. The cost of these therapies can be high, and the evidence supporting their use is
not sufﬁciently strong to justify their use as primary therapy
without an attempt at lower cost, evidence-based methods.
However, failure to demonstrate improvement after 4 weeks
of treatment with a decrease in wound size of at least 30% to
40% should lead the clinician to consider adjunctive treatment options.109 Re-evaluation of the patient and wound
should be performed before the use of adjuvant therapies
to ensure that compression has achieved ed
