Recommendation for postoperative surveillance. We
recommend baseline imaging in the ﬁrst month after
EVAR with contrast-enhanced CT and color duplex ultrasound imaging. In the absence of an endoleak or sac
enlargement, imaging should be repeated in 12 months
using contrast-enhanced CT or color duplex ultrasound
imaging.

We recommend prompt evaluation for possible aortoenteric ﬁstula in a patient presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding after aneurysm repair.

If a type II endoleak is observed 1 month after EVAR, we
suggest postoperative surveillance with contrastenhanced CT and color duplex ultrasound imaging at 6
months.

In patients presenting with an infected graft in the presence of extensive contamination with gross purulence,
we recommend extra-anatomic reconstruction followed
by excision of all graft material along with aortic stump
closure covered by an omental ﬂap.

If neither endoleak nor AAA enlargement is observed 1
year after EVAR, we suggest color duplex ultrasound
when feasible, or CT imaging if ultrasound is not possible,
for annual surveillance.
Level of recommendation

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

In patients presenting with an infected graft with minimal contamination, we suggest in situ reconstruction
with cryopreserved allograft.

If a type II endoleak is associated with an aneurysm sac
that is shrinking or stable in size, we suggest color duplex
ultrasound for continued surveillance at 6-month intervals for 24 months and then annually thereafter.
