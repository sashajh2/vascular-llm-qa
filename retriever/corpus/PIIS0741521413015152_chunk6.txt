 on anatomic extent of disease and arteriographic ﬁndings without sufﬁcient emphasis on the
physiologic state of the limb.
The marked demographic shift over the last quarter
century because of the global epidemic of diabetes has
made the admonition of the original drafters of the term
CLI increasingly relevant. The rising incidence of diabetes
and diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) as well as an increased
incidence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in patients
with diabetes further mandates a reconsideration of the
concept of CLI.23 In many modern series, the prevalence
of diabetes in reports of patients undergoing revascularization for limb salvage is as high as 50% to 80%. The diabetes
prevalence was 58% in the Bypass vs Angioplasty in Severe
Ischaemia of the Leg (BASIL) trial,24-26 64% in the Project
of Ex-Vivo Vein Graft Engineering via Transfection III
(PREVENT III) trial,27 and exceeds 70% to 80% in many
specialized vascular centers.28,29 Although tradition teaches
that the initiating cause of foot ulceration in patients with
diabetes is primarily neuropathy (loss of protective sensation and foot deformity from motor neuropathy), DFUs
may be broadly categorized into three groups: purely
neuropathic, purely ischemic, and neuroischemic (mixed).
Based on recent studies, the prevalence of neuroischemic
ulcers has steadily risen from approximately 20%-25% in
the 1990s to over 50% of patients currently.23 Thus,
