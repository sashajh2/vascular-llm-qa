statistically signiﬁcant), but did not reduce incidence of VTE, while
therapeutic LMWH evaluated in one study reduced
both SVT extension (statistically signiﬁcant) and progression to VTE, but improvement was less signiﬁcant at
3 month follow-up due to a catch-up phenomenon.34
NSAIDS were also found in one study to reduce SVT
extension (statistically signiﬁcant).258 However, there
were no differences in the resolution of local symptoms
and signs of SVT and in the incidence of VTE. While there
were no major bleeding episodes recorded in either the
NSAID or placebo groups, indomethacin increased the
rate of adverse effects.259 NSAIDs have also been found
to increase the risk of gastric pain three-fold compared
with placebo.258,259
Compared with elastic stockings alone, one study
showed that HL&S plus elastic stockings reduced the
risk of SVT extension and recurrence (RR, 0.09; 95% CI,
0.01-0.64) and was associated with a lower, statistically
not signiﬁcant, incidence of VTE (RR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.081.78).260 However, most studies evaluating surgery and
topical treatments did not report SVT progression, VTE,
or adverse events.34
A recent analysis from the RIETE registry of patients
with thrombosis involving main trunk of the GSV within
3 cm of the SFJ compared those treated with full dose
fondaparinux or LMWH followed by VKA (227 patients)
to those (147 patients) who received prophylactic doses
of fondaparinux or intermediate dose LMWH.255 Those
receiving full-dose anticoagulation received a longer
course of treatment and all patients were followed for
3 months. There was no difference in the incidence of
VTE or recurrent SVT between the groups or in the safety
outcomes of major bleeding or clinically nonmajor
bleeding. The authors concluded that these ﬁndings
are hypothesis generating and support a trial evaluating
the efﬁcacy of preventative dose anticoagulation in

comparison with therapeutic
