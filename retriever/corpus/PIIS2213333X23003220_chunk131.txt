popliteal vein to the superﬁcial network or if there are
other sources of proximal reﬂux connecting to the SSV,
not treated initially (Table XX). Currently UGFS appears
to be the preferred treatment.221
9.1.5. For patients with residual or recurrent varicosity
due to incompetent perforator veins (IPVs), treatment
with both open and endovascular techniques may be
used depending on the physician’s experience, patient
wishes, and availability of technology.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. There are no high-level data to compare
outcome of different techniques to treat IPVs responsible
for recurrent/persistent varicose veins. One should rely on
experience, patient wishes, and the availability of the
various techniques reviewed above.
Evidence. A 2016 prospective trial with 296 IPV closures on 112 patients compared three methods of IPV
closure (RFA, EVLA, and FS) in mostly C5 and C6 patients.223 Closure success was signiﬁcantly better with
RFA (73%; P ¼ .05) vs FS (57%) but failed to reach signiﬁcance vs EVLA (61%; P ¼ .09). Interestingly, when
patients failed FS and were subsequently treated with
thermal ablation, RFA success improved to 89% (P ¼

.003) and EVLA success improved to 85% (P ¼ .03). The
authors concluded that RFA was found to be the most
reliable means of IPV closure. After failed FS attempts,
IPV closure was enhanced when thermal ablation was
used as a secondary technique. A common factor
leading to increased failure in all groups was morbid
obesity. Although C2 to C6 patients were enrolled in
this study, only three with C2 disease were included
and all three were treated with foam initially, thereby
signiﬁcantly limiting the applicability
