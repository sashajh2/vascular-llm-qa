 a mean 91-month
follow-up period.117 Because rupture of CAAs has been
reported to occur at diameters <20 mm, close radiologic
follow-up of those selected for observation with yearly CT
scans is appropriate.
Continued surveillance, even after secondary technical
success, is imperative as the natural history of visceral artery aneurysms after endovascular treatment remains
unclear. This is especially true of saccular aneurysms
treated with coil or thrombin embolization; unlike formal
exclusion with a covered stent, these aneurysms are not
technically “excluded” from arterial circulation. Indeed,

ultrasound or CT is necessary for patients with visceral
aneurysms treated by embolization because of the risk
of recanalization.111-114
Treatment failures including persistent perfusion,
recanalization, and coil migration have been observed.
The potential for early or late failure, such as growth in
sac size or leak that would require reintervention, requires early and serial imaging follow-up.93,97 Because
artifact due to the radiopaque materials used may
make sensitive CT evaluation difﬁcult, some authors
recommend contrast-enhanced ultrasound or MRI as
follow-up imaging techniques.6,97

In patients who are thought to have gastric or gastroepiploic artery aneurysms,
we recommend CTA as the diagnostic tool of choice

In patients who are thought to have gastric or gastroepiploic artery aneurysms
and have high radiation exposure risks or renal insufﬁciency, we recommend
non-contrast-enhanced MRA for diagnosis.
