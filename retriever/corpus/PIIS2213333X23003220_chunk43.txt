.89 When comparing against different levels

of compression and lengths of stockings, there was no
clear difference in this Cochrane review.88 Patient preference for one stocking over another was largely driven
by comfort. None of the studies assessed QOL. Overall,
there was insufﬁcient high quality of evidence to determine whether compression stockings are effective as the
primary treatment for symptomatic varicose veins and if

suggest that compliance with compression stockings
can be as low as 37%.90 For additional evidence, see Part I

and axial reﬂux in the GSV or SSV who are candidates
for intervention, we recommend superﬁcial venous
intervention over long-term compression stockings.
