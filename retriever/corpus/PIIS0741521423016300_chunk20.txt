Disease (https://doi.org/10.1002/dmrr.3657).43 This guideline
builds on a previous version of the IWGDF guideline on
peripheral artery disease in patients with foot ulcers and
diabetes, and integrates with the Global Vascular Guidelines (GVG) on the management of Chronic Limb Threatening Ischaemia.20,37

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical question. In a person with diabetes with or
without a foot ulcer, does medical history and clinical examination (including pulse palpation) compared with a
reference test (imaging - digital subtraction angiography
[DSA], magnetic resonance angiography [MRA],
computed tomography angiography [CTA], colour
Duplex ultrasound [CDUS]) accurately identify and reliably diagnose PAD?
Clinical question. In a person with diabetes with or
without a foot ulcer, which non-invasive bedside testing
alone or in combination compared with reference tests
(imaging - digital subtraction angiography [DSA], magnetic resonance angiography [MRA], computed tomography angiography [CTA], colour Duplex ultrasound
[CDUS]) should be performed to accurately and reliably
diagnose PAD?

Recommendation 1
In a person with diabetes without a foot ulcer, take a relevant
history for peripheral artery disease, examine
