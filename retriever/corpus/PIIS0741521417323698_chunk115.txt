of an anatomically challenging AAA. The Nellix Endovascular Aneurysm Sealing System (Endologix, Irvine, Calif)
has also been proposed for treatment of ruptured

Role of EVAR. In an effort to improve outcomes for
patients presenting with symptomatic or ruptured
AAAs, the impact of urgent or emergent EVAR has
been recently evaluated. An early randomized trial
comparing EVAR and OSR for ruptured AAAs revealed
that the suitability for endovascular repair was only
46%, but the rate of EVAR was lower (30%).472 Observational studies have revealed improved outcomes after emergent EVAR for ruptured AAAs, but signiﬁcant
selection bias and lack of uniform inclusion criteria and
reporting standards confound these analyses.469 The
Immediate Management of Patients with Rupture:
Open Versus Endovascular Repair (IMPROVE) trial was
a multicenter randomized trial of EVAR and open
repair for patients presenting with a ruptured AAA.473
Patients were randomized before CT imaging was
performed; 316 patients were randomized to EVAR and
297 patients to open repair. The 30-day mortality was
similar among patients treated with EVAR (35.4%) or
open repair (37.4%). Secondary analyses demonstrated
shorter length of stay and a higher proportion of patients discharged to home for those treated by EVAR.
A potential limitation of this study was the application
of an intent-to-treat analysis, which incorporated outcomes for those participants initially randomized to
EVAR but whose anatomy required open repair to the
EVAR group. Recently reported 1-year outcomes
demonstrated that EVAR was most cost-effective
compared with open repair, but no survival beneﬁt
was observed.
An analysis of national trends in the United States
conﬁrms that EVAR is being used with increasing frequency for the treatment of ruptured AAA, with a
decrease in associated mortality.474,475 Outcomes are superior when EVAR for a ruptured aneurysm is performed
in teaching hospitals and high-volume centers.474

If it is anatomically feasible, we recommend EVAR over open
repair
