100%, respectively.159 The 5-year primary and secondary
patency rates are noted to be 60% to 85% and 80% to 95%,
respectively.139,159-161 Perioperative mortality can be expected
to be approximately #1%,139,161 and morbidity can range
from 5% to 20%.139,159 Long-term outcomes may be inferior

CFA interventions. Limited data are available to support the use of interventional therapy in occlusive disease of
the CFAs, but several single-center experiences have been
published,163-165 presenting a technical success rate of
nearly 90% and 1-year primary patency rate of 75%. Information on longer-term patency is limited, and no information is available regarding stent stability in this area
over even this short period of time. Given the limited
morbidity and risk entailed with femoral endarterectomy,
the use of interventions in this vessel for the present time
should be limited to those with a prohibitive risk for open
surgical therapy related to local or systemic risk factors.
Hybrid interventions. The use of interventional therapies for iliac disease allows treatment of occlusive disease
in patients with limited morbidity; however, when the disease extends into the CFAs, an approach using open surgical techniques to treat the CFA and stents to treat the iliac
or inﬂow vessels offers an alternative to traditional aortofemoral grafting.142,144,156 In these instances, the endarterectomy is extended proximally into the external iliac artery,
and stenting is done into the upper area of the endarterectomy to limit progression of disease in an intervening
segment. Surgical angioplast
