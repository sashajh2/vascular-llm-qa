 Visceral artery aneurysms include
both true aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms. Many
true visceral artery aneurysms are degenerative or
atherosclerotic in nature, with histologic specimens
demonstrating reduced smooth muscle, disruption of
elastic ﬁbers, and deﬁciency of the arterial media.1
Other common causes of visceral artery aneurysms
include ﬁbromuscular dysplasia, collagen vascular diseases, inﬂammatory conditions, and other rare
inherited illnesses, such as the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
As such, in patients with multiple aneurysms or aneurysms in different visceral beds, genetic testing is indicated for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. In
contrast to the causes of true aneurysms of the visceral
vessels, visceral artery pseudoaneurysms are most
commonly related to trauma, iatrogenic injury, local inﬂammatory processes, or infection.
The clinical signiﬁcance of visceral artery aneurysms is
mainly related to their potential for rupture and the
extreme challenge of emergent diagnosis and treatment
of these uncommon aneurysms once rupture has
occurred. Nearly one-fourth of visceral artery aneurysms
reported in the literature have presented with rupture,
and the reported mortality rate of these diagnosed ruptures is at least 10% and is likely to be much higher.2,3 Reported deaths after ruptured celiac artery aneurysms
and ruptured splenic artery aneurysms in pregnant
women approach 100%. Because of the increased use
of sophisticated forms of intra-abdominal imaging,
including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic
resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography
(CT), and CT angiography (CTA), occult visceral artery aneurysms are being diagnosed with increased frequency.
These detailed imaging studies are allowing an
improved ability for vascular surgeons to identify asymptomatic lesions and an enhanced potential for preoperative or preprocedural planning and elective treatment of
these aneurysms. Improvements in endovascular therapies have also allowed an enhanced ability for treatment
of these often anatomically complex lesions with a large
variety of individualized and precise catheter-based
therapies.
