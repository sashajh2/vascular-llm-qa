 recent pooled analysis of 1557 patients from
three large randomized trials (EVA-3S, SPACE, and ICSS)
showed an independent association between closed-cell
design and reduced risk of periprocedural stroke or
death.398 However, in a systemic review and comprehensive meta-analysis of 33 studies (including 2 randomized trials), use of an open cell stent design in CAS
was associated with decreased risk of restenosis
compared with the closed-cell stent without signiﬁcant
differences in periprocedural outcomes.399
Mesh-covered stents. A new generation of dual layered
carotid stents has been designed. These consist of thin
struts of nitinol wires covered with nitinol or polyethyleneterephthalate mesh, which helps to stabilize the plaque
and reduce risk of distal embolization.400 The Roadsaver
Carotid Artery Stent System (Microvention/Terumo), the
Gore Carotid Stent (W. L. Gore & Associates) and the CGuard
Carotid Stent System (InspireMD) feature different constructions, but all have a mesh covering with an open or
closed cell design, and a pore size that ranges from 180 to
500 mm. However, studies on the efﬁcacy and safety of
these stents are still inconclusive. Assessment of 41 procedures of ICA and CCA stenting using the Roadsaver
double nitinol layer micromesh stent in 40 nonconsecutive
patients with symptomatic or high-risk carotid artery stenosis showed favorable outcomes with one minor stroke
occurring after CCA selection with a guiding catheter
(before stent deployment) and one transient postprocedural TIA of the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere. No
restenosis or thrombosis were observed. Angiographic
stenosis decreased from 82.9 6 9.1% (range, 61%-97%) to
19.3 6 7.3% (range, 0%-34%) (P < .05).401
