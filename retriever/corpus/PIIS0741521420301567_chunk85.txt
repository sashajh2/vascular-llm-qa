may be too small to selectively catheterize for coil embolization.6,132,213,223 The NBCA must be premixed with
iodized oil to control its polymerization and to make it
radiopaque.224 A 1:3 ratio, or 25% NBCA, increases the
polymerization time to 4 seconds, although distal embolization may still occur.225
Ethylene vinyl alcohol (Onyx) has also been used successfully to treat PDAA.65 Onyx is dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide and is suspended in radiopaque micronized
tantalum powder; it does not need to be mixed. When
concomitant balloon occlusion of the parent vessel is
used, injection of the Onyx directly into the aneurysm
through a microcatheter preserves the inﬂow and
outﬂow vessels. When balloon occlusion is not used,
the inﬂow and outﬂow vessels can be obliterated as well.
Flow-diverting stents are a burgeoning technology that
was ﬁrst introduced for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Flow-diverting stents are placed in the parent

This is thought to result in retrograde ﬂow through the
pancreaticoduodenal arteries, leading to turbulent ﬂow,
which ultimately causes aneurysmal dilation. Interestingly, celiac stenosis is more common in PDAA than in
GDAA.229 Whereas coil embolization can lead to endorgan hepatic ischemia and liver failure, the overall risk
is likely to be low.208 However, a low threshold for celiac
revascularization should be considered in patients with
symptoms of mesenteric insufﬁciency at baseline or
when there is a risk of compromising end-organ perfusion with aneurysm treatment, and postoperative liver
function test results should be monitored closely.4,212 In
cases of median arcuate ligament syndrome, celiac
