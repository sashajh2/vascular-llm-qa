 without a detailed knowledge of the underlying data.
● Grade 2 recommendations are weaker and reflect ther-

apies where the benefits and risks are uncertain or are
more closely balanced. For such interventions, patients
may choose different options based on their underlying values.

Comment
Strong recommendation, generalizable
Strong recommendation; may change with
further research
Intermediate recommendation; likely to
change with further research
Intermediate recommendation: May vary
with patient values
Weak recommendation: May vary with
patient values
Weak recommendation: Alternative
treatments may be equally valid

RCT, Randomized controlled trial.

In accordance with the American College of Chest
Physicians (ACCP) guidelines for the antithrombotic treatment of venous thromboembolic disease,24 we have adopted the language of “recommending” the use of strong
Grade 1 guidelines and “suggesting” the use of weaker
Grade 2 guidelines.
Although trial methodology is related to the quality of
the evidence, clinicians are actually most interested in reliable estimates of the benefits and harms associated with a
therapy.21 For high-quality evidence, the effects of therapy
(beneficial or ill) are precise, and further research is unlikely
to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. In
contrast, the estimated effect provided by poor-quality
evidence is unclear and likely to change as better quality
