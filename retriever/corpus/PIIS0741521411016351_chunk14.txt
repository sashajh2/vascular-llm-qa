37,38 Overall, the prevalence of
carotid artery stenosis among patients undergoing CABG is
higher than the general population. In patients with symptomatic CAD and other risk factors, such as age ⬎65 years,
history of stroke or TIA, left main coronary stenosis, diabetes mellitus, carotid bruit, peripheral arterial disease
(PAD), and previous carotid operation, it is feasible that a
subset of patients with a prevalence ⬎20% can be identified
who might benefit from carotid screening.37,39-45 The
ACC/AHA guidelines46 note that carotid screening before
CABG is probably indicated in the following subset of
patients: age ⬎65 years, left main coronary stenosis, history
of smoking, history of TIA/stroke or carotid bruit, and
PAD.
Several studies47-51 have suggested that the prevalence
of ⱖ60% carotid artery stenosis among patients with symptomatic PAD is ⬎20%, regardless of the patient’s age.
However, the prevalence of ⱖ60% carotid artery stenosis
among patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is
⬍20%.52-54 This suggests that screening patients with AAA
would have only a modest benefit and only if intervention
could be performed with low morbidity and mortality.23
Because there is no evidence that stroke risk after AAA
repair is increased by the presence of carotid stenosis,
routine carotid screening of AAA patients is not indicated.
In patients with prior head and neck radiotherapy, the
prevalence of significant carotid artery stenosis may be high
enough, depending on the time between radiotherapy exposure and screening, to justify routine carotid screening.55-59 The highest incidence is generally observed 15
years after radiotherapy exposure, with 21.3% and 5.3%
rates of ipsilateral and contralateral stenosis, respectively.
The data also suggest that the ipsilateral common carotid
(CCA) and internal carotid arteries (ICA) are both in-
