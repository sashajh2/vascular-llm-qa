¼ .053) complications,
whereas endovascular repair was associated with more
hemorrhagic complications (P ¼ .08), presumed to be
access related. Importantly, a signiﬁcant reduction in
median hospital length of stay and need for postdischarge nursing services was identiﬁed in the endovascular cohort accompanied by a trend toward lower cost.
Additional retrospective comparisons of open and endovascular procedures have reported no signiﬁcant difference in mortality, perioperative morbidity, freedom
from reintervention, or decline in renal function and the
beneﬁt of a shortened length of stay.2,14,34
Robot-assisted laparoscopy techniques for RAA repair
have only more recently been described.77-80 This
approach typically requires a multidisciplinary collaborative procedural team of vascular, general, transplantation, and urology surgeons. The dexterity of the robotic
arms reportedly confers a technical advantage to complex aneurysmectomy and intracorporeal vascular suturing for reconstruction. Technical success has been
reported in case series with warm ischemia times between 15 and 60 minutes; however, a direct comparison
to open and endovascular techniques has yet to be
performed.77,78,80

We suggest screening female patients with RAA for ﬁbromuscular dysplasia
with a focused history and one-time axial imaging study (ie, CTA or MRA) to
assess for cerebrovascular, mesenteric, and iliac artery dysplasia.

Midterm follow-up is available out to 3 to 4 years in

and low rates of recanalization have been observed
requiring reintervention (4%-13%).6,71-75
