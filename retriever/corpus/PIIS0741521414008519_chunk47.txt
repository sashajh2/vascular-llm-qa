ammation, with expression in
the interstitial space and in the venous ulcer wound
bed.48 In a nonrandomized evaluation of various cytokine levels and venous ulcer healing in patients undergoing compression therapy, it was determined that
untreated ulcers typically display high levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines, including several interleukins, TNF-a,
and interferon-g. After 4 weeks of compression therapy,
the levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines decreased significantly and the wounds began to heal. After compression,
levels of TGF-b1 increased signiﬁcantly as the ulcers
improved. When speciﬁc cytokine levels were related to
the percentage of healing, it was found that those with
higher levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines including
interleukin-1 and interferon-g healed signiﬁcantly better
than those with lower levels of these cytokines before
compression.83 As a result of venous hypertension,
inﬂammation, and remodeling, a key feature takes place
in the postcapillary venule where the ﬁbrin cuff, a complex process involving ﬁbrin and collagen deposition, is
formed. The result is a major abnormality in dermal
microcirculation with many components forming the
postcapillary cuff, including collagen I and III, ﬁbronectin, vitronectin, laminin, tenascin, ﬁbrin, TGF-b1,
and a2-macroglobulin.48,84 Although the exact mechanisms and reasons for development of the ﬁbrin cuff are
unknown, the chemical and structural changes in the
postcapillary venule are thought to be in response to
changes in shear stress and elevated venous pressures,
which probably lead to progressive dermal changes and
ulceration. Structural proteins have been analyzed in varicose veins from patients with CVD, with the important
ﬁnding that overall collagen is increased and both elastin
and laminin are decreased.85 When the collagen was
examined in smooth muscle from varicose veins, the
consistent ﬁnding was that there was a signiﬁcant
decrease of collagen type III and increased type I, and
the same biochemical proﬁle was also observed in the
dermal ﬁbroblasts from varic
