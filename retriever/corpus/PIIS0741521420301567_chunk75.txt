asymptomatic. Colic artery aneurysms, however, cause
symptoms, primarily abdominal pain, in nearly 90% of
patients.166 Rupture may complicate up to 30% of jejunal
and ileal artery aneurysms and up to 70% of colic artery
aneurysms, resulting in gastrointestinal bleeding and
mortality rates that approach 20% to 50%.140,166 Treatment is recommended for all jejunal and ileal artery aneurysms >2 cm and for all colic branch aneurysms,
regardless of size.166,184
We recommend emergent intervention for any jejunal,
ileal, or colic artery aneurysm, any size, resulting in patient symptoms or rupture and all mesenteric branch
vessel pseudoaneurysms (Grade 1A).
Interpretation of the existing data on mesenteric
branch aneurysms is limited by small numbers and
anecdotal reports. In addition, most of the existing
studies do not delineate true aneurysms from false

aneurysms, and the visceral bed is often excluded from
analysis.
Surgical management has historically relied on simple
arterial ligation or aneurysm excision without
reconstruction.56,87,140,169,184,185 This remains a conservative option for rupture, in which case exploratory laparotomy facilitates the evacuation of hematoma,
deÔ¨Ånitive aneurysm treatment, and bowel assessment
for viability. Enterectomy or colectomy may be
required as intramural aneurysms and those associated
with bowel necrosis require resection of the involved
bowel at the time of aneur
