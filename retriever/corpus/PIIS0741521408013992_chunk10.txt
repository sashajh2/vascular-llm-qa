needs to undergo additional procedures to promote autogenous access maturation or place a new vascular access, or
both. Hemodialysis patients are usually dialyzed through a
central venous catheter while this process is completed.
Catheter use is associated with bacteremia and inadequate
dialysis, which is time/use-related.31 Catheter use at initiation of dialysis is also associated with higher subsequent
mortality.32-34 Furthermore, mortality is higher among
patients who receive dialyses continuously through a catheter than among those who switch from a catheter to
autogenous or prosthetic permanent access.35 It should be
noted that it is unclear from these studies whether catheter
use directly causes higher mortality or whether catheter use
is a marker for other conditions and situations associated
with increased mortality risk.
In addition to central vein preservation, peripheral upper extremity veins should also be preserved for future
placement of permanent vascular access; therefore whenever possible, hand veins should be used in preference to
arm veins for phlebotomy and intravenous catheter placement in patients with CKD, despite the increased discomfort for patients. Particular care should be taken to avoid
cannulation of the cephalic vein in the nondominant arm.
When arm veins must be used, the site should be rotated.
Percutaneous intravenous central catheters (PICCs) should
not be used in patients with evidence of renal dysfunction
until their renal status is evaluated.
Because of low rates of autogenous access placement
among incident hemodialysis patients, time required for
successful autogenous access maturation, and associations
of catheter use with adverse outcomes among hemodialysis
patients, there is ready consensus that patients with CKD
should be referred for autogenous access placement well
before the initiation of dialysis. However, scant information
is available to suggest exactly how far in advance of the need
for dialysis and when in relation to their level of renal
function and course of their CKD patients should be referred for initial AV access construction. Consequently,
although there is broad agreement among different national guidelines that timely referral for
