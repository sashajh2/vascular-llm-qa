4.1

We suggest abdominal axial imaging to screen for concomitant abdominal aneurysms.

4.2

We suggest one-time screening CTA (or MRA) of the head, neck, and chest for those
patients with segmental arterial mediolysis.

B (Moderate)

Axial imaging as recommended will screen for
concomitant nonaortic intra-abdominal arterial aneurysms, which are common.
We recommend screening for cerebrovascular and coronary artery aneurysm when the diagnosis of segmental

cording to the amount of thrombus within the aneurysm. Multiplanar reformations and three-dimensional
reconstructions can aid in determining the relationship
of the surrounding vasculature and parent vessels. In
cases of ruptured GDAA and PDAA, CTA is the diagnostic

Recommendation

evidence

5.1

We suggest interval surveillance (ie, every 12-24 months) with axial imaging (ie, CTA
or MRA) for cases of segmental medial arteriolysis in light of reported cases of rapid
arterial transformation and to monitor regression in cases of polyarteritis nodosa.

5.2

We suggest postembolization surveillance every 1 to 2 years with axial imaging
to assess for vascular remodeling and evidence of aneurysm reperfusion.
