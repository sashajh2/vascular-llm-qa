% of the limbs, the remainder of which will have
either isolated or combined associated deep vein incompetence or obstruction or perforator incompetence.159-161
Additional anatomic patterns of axial reﬂux directed to the
bed of the VLU are important to be deﬁned.162
Guideline 3.10: Venous Plethysmography
We suggest selective use of venous plethysmography in the evaluation of patients with suspected
venous leg ulcer if venous duplex ultrasound does not
provide deﬁnitive diagnostic information. [GRADE 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Venous plethysmography (strain-gauge, air, or photoplethysmography) provides additional venous limb physiologic
parameters regarding global venous reﬂux, outﬂow obstruction, and calf muscle pump function and has shown good correlation with venous duplex ultrasound.163-168 Some studies
have shown utility for monitoring of venous functional
changes and assessment of physiologic outcome of surgical
treatments.169-172 However, current evidence does not support a primary role for venous plethysmography as a diagnostic
test for venous disease above venous duplex ultrasound.
Venous plethysmography should be reserved for equivocal
ﬁndings of venous duplex ultrasound examination, for recalcitrant or recurrent VLU, or if additional venous physiologic
testing is required for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons.
Guideline 3.11: Venous Imaging
We suggest selective computed tomography venography, magnetic resonance venography, contrast
venography, and/or intravascular ultrasound in patients with suspected venous leg ulceration if additional
advanced venous diagnosis is required for thrombotic
or nonthrombotic iliac vein obstruction or for operative planning before open or endovenous interventions.
[GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Venous outﬂow obstruction has been underappreciated as a cause of venous hypertension and associated
venous disease because of lack of a noninvasive screening
