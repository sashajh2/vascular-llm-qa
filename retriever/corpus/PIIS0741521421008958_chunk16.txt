Combined CEA and coronary artery bypass grafting
vs CEA ﬁrst. Estimates were highly imprecise to derive
conclusions about the outcomes of death (17 studies;
RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.78-2.29; Supplementary Table I,
online only), stroke (16 studies; RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.30-1.72;
Supplementary Table I, online only), MI (14 studies; RR,
0.85; 95% CI, 0.45-1.62; Supplementary Table I, online
only), and combined death/stroke (2 studies; RR, 1.46;
95% CI, 0.06-38.22; Supplementary Table I, online only).
Coronary artery bypass grafting ﬁrst vs CEA ﬁrst. Estimates were highly imprecise to derive conclusions about
the outcomes of death (8 studies; RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.442.01; Supplementary Table I, online only), stroke (7
studies; RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.64-3.06; Supplementary
Table I, online only), and MI (8 studies; RR, 0.51; 95% CI,
0.22-1.18; Supplementary Table I, online only).
Carotid artery stenting.
Combined coronary artery bypass grafting and CAS
vs CAS ﬁrst. Estimates were highly imprecise to derive
conclusions about the outcome of death (2 studies; RR,
