with UGFS, EVLA was associated with a lower risk of
minor AEs (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45-0.93; I2 ¼ 78.6%; 5
studies81,94,101,104,108). RFA was signiﬁcantly associated
with an increased risk of minor AEs than n-butyl
cyanoacrylate (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.13-2.33; 1 study93).
Serious AEs. RFA was signiﬁcantly associated with an
increased risk of serious AEs than CAC (RR, 2.90; 95%
CI, 1.06-7.92; 1 study97).
Total AEs. EVLA was signiﬁcantly associated with
increased risk of total AEs than CAC (RR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.162.35; I2 ¼ 72.5%; 2 studies75,76). RFA was signiﬁcantly associated with an increased risk of total AEs than n-butyl
cyanoacrylate (RR,1.63; 95% CI, 1.13-2.33; 1 study93). The most

which is usually mild and responds well to nonsteroidal
anti-inﬂammatory treatment.85 All outcomes and
