ow between two
measurements, at least ﬁve cm apart. Retrograde ﬂow can occur in the superﬁcial or deep veins, with or without perforating
veins. Junctional reﬂux is limited to the saphenofemoral (SFJ) or saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ). Segmental reﬂux occurs in
only a portion of a superﬁcial or deep truncal vein.

1.3.3.

A deﬁnition of “pathologic” perforating veins in patients with varicose veins (CEAP) clinical class C2 includes those with an
outward ﬂow duration of >500 ms and a diameter of >3.5 mm on DUS.

Good Practice Statements
1.4.1.

We recommend that evaluation of reﬂux with DUS be performed in an Intersocietal Accreditation Commission or American
College of Radiology accredited vascular laboratory by a credentialed ultrasonographer, with the patient standing whenever
possible. A sitting or reverse Trendelenburg position can be used if the patient cannot stand.

1.4.2. We recommend that for evaluation of reﬂux with DUS, the sonographer use either a Valsalva maneuver or augmentation to
assess the common femoral vein and SFJ and distal augmentation with either manual compression or cuff deﬂation for
evaluation of more distal segments. Superﬁcial reﬂux must be traced to its source, including the saphenous junctions, truncal
or perforating veins, or pelvic origin varicose veins. The study should be interpreted by a physician trained in venous DUS
interpretation.
1.4.3.

We recommend that a complete DUS examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities include transverse gray scale
images without and with transducer compression of the common femoral, proximal, mid, and distal femoral and popliteal
veins, SFJ, and at least two segments along the GSV and SSV.

1.4.4. We recommend that a complete DUS examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities include measurement of the
spectral Doppler waveform using calipers. Reﬂux at baseline and in response to a Valsalva maneuver or distal augmentation
