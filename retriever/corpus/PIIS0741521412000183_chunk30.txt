0 years. However, pooled analysis19 of
the five studies75-77,80,83 evaluating reflux showed thrombectomy was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of reflux (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.46-0.99).
Among the four studies75,80,82,83 evaluating venous patency, there was a nonsignificant trend toward less venous
obstruction (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.60-1.19) among those
undergoing thrombectomy. Most important, there was a
significant reduction in the risk of the patient-important
outcome of the postthrombotic syndrome (RR, 0.67; 95%
CI, 0.52-0.87). Unfortunately, pooled analysis19 of these
nine trials yielded no reliable data regarding the risk of
complications or death. As with all strategies of early
thrombus removal, careful attention to patient selection
and an individual assessment of risks vs benefits as well as
patient values and preferences is required in recommending
iliofemoral venous thrombectomy.
The specific thrombectomy techniques and adjuvants
used for catheter-directed and pharmacomechanical thrombolysis techniques are largely guided by case series and expert
opinion rather than by comparative trials. Important technical
aspects of the procedure include preoperative imaging to
demonstrate the proximal extent of thrombus with an extended surgical approach if the IVC is involved; intraoperative
use of positive end-expiratory pressure to reduce the risk of PE;
intraoperative completion venography to ensure patency of the
iliac vein; stenting of any identified iliac vein lesions; use of a
temporary arteriovenous fistula to reduce early rethrombosis; and
carefully monitored postoperative anticoagulation.15,84
Although thrombectomy does appear to be associated with improved long-term outcomes after iliofemoral DVT, the overall quality of the data supporting its use
is low, and there are little data allowing a reliable estimate of risk vs benefits in an individual patient19 (Grade
2C). The interval estimates are wide, but there is a trend
