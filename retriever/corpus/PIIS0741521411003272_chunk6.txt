Guideline title
We recommend that in patients with varicose veins and more
advanced chronic venous disease, computed tomography
venography, magnetic resonance venography, ascending and
descending contrast venography, and intravascular ultrasonography
are used selectively, including but not limited to post-thrombotic
syndrome, thrombotic or nonthrombotic iliac vein obstruction
(May-Thurner syndrome), pelvic congestion syndrome, nutcracker
syndrome, vascular malformations, venous trauma, tumors, and
planned open or endovascular venous interventions.
5. Laboratory evaluation
We recommend that in patients with varicose veins, evaluation for
thrombophilia is needed selectively for those with recurrent deep
venous thrombosis, thrombosis at a young age, or thrombosis in
an unusual site. Laboratory examinations are needed in patients
with long-standing venous stasis ulcers and in selected patients
who undergo general anesthesia for the treatment of chronic
venous disease.
6. Classification
We recommend that the CEAP classification be used for patients with
chronic venous disease. The basic CEAP classification is used for
clinical practice, and the full CEAP classification system is used for
clinical research.
We recommend that primary venous disorders, including simple
varicose veins, be differentiated from secondary venous
insufficiency and from congenital venous disorders because the
three conditions differ in pathophysiology and management.
7. Outcome assessment
We recommend that the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score is
used for
