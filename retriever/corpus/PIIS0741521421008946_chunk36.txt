may have reduced rates of perioperative spontaneous
embolization compared with those not taking statins.155 These clinical beneﬁts may be partly due to
the anti-inﬂammatory and plaque-stabilizing pleiotropic effects of statin medications,156,157 but is not clear
how soon before surgery one should start a patient on
statins to achieve these beneﬁcial effects. However, the
sudden withdrawal of statin medications in the perioperative period should be avoided, because there is evidence that sudden cessation may be associated with
increased perioperative cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality.158
Patients should remain on aspirin therapy perioperatively,159 and low-dose aspirin (81 mg or 325 mg) seems
to be as effective as higher dose aspirin.160 The beneﬁt
of aspirin in reducing the rate of perioperative stroke
without increasing bleeding complications was
demonstrated in a randomized trial.161 However, some
previous work also suggested that sudden cessation
of chronic aspirin therapy may be associated with a
rebound increased incidence of ischemic events but
recent data do not support this observation.162,163
Continuation of dual antiplatelet therapy in the perioperative period should be individualized. In a metaanalysis of three randomized clinical trials including
36,881 patients undergoing CEA, dual antiplatelet therapy was not associated with reduced risk of perioperative stroke, TIA, or death, but it was associated with
increased risk of neck hematoma and major bleeding
complications.164 Conversely, in a review of 10,46 patients undergoing vascular surgerydincluding 5264 undergoing CEAdthere was no difference in the risk of
bleeding complications among patients on aspirin, clopidogrel, or dual aspirin þ clopidogrel therapy, or no
antiplatelet therapy.165 Clearly, among those patients
with a speciﬁc indication for clopidogrel such as symptomatic carotid disease or recent stent placement, dual
antiplate
