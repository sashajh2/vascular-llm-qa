TREATMENT
Indications

Surrogate outcomes
Surrogate outcomes assess specific technical questions
about a particular therapy. Surrogate outcomes may include patency of the ablated saphenous or perforating vein,
patency of a venous stent, or hemodynamic results after
interventions. These should be used with care when evaluating the clinical benefit of an intervention.124
Anatomic success. Patency of an ablated vein and the
length of the patent or obstructed segment of the vein, as
confirmed with duplex scanning, should be reported when
assessing anatomic success. Postprocedural duplex scanning ⱕ1 month, at 1 year, at 1 to 3 years, and ⬎3 years is
important to define periprocedural, early, midterm, and
late failures. Timing of the study is important because
saphenous patency after ablation on a periprocedural duplex image (⬍3 days) indicates technical failure, whereas
late patency after early occlusion suggests recanalization.
The type of recurrence on late duplex scanning should also
be documented, because recanalization of a previously
occluded axial vein should be distinguished from neovascularization, which implies the presence of multiple small
tortuous connections between the saphenous stump or the
femoral vein and a residual saphenous vein or its
tributaries.124
Hemodynamic success. The presence or absence of
recurrent reflux in treated incompetent veins should be
documented by duplex scanning, because this represents
technical failure or success of the procedure.126 Changes in
venous hemodynamics of the limb can also be documented
by changes in plethysmographic findings before and after
therapy; hemodynamic results frequently correlate with
clinical outcome.95,127
Safety
The safety of any procedure used for treatment of
varicose veins or more advanced CVD needs to be established, and the procedurally related early adverse effects
(⬍30 days) and late complications should be documented.
Table V defines minor and major complications for reporting purposes.124

Most patients who seek treatment for varicose veins
have symptoms of aching, throbbing, feeling of a heavy leg,
fatigue, cramps
