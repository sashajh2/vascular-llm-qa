5%; P ⫽ .006). It is of interest to note that the authors of
this trial highlight the fact that they observed a higher rate
of fatal MIs with CAS than with CEA. This observation has
not been confirmed in other large studies, including
CREST, and in meta-analysis, where the incidence of MI is
higher in the CEA group.11
D. Meta-analysis: CEA vs CAS
Murad et al11 recently completed an updated metaanalysis of all published trials comparing CEA and CAS in
the management of patients with carotid stenosis. This
analysis included data from the most recently completed
randomized studies, CREST and ICST, which comprised
56% of all reported patients. Their analysis concluded that,
compared with CEA, CAS was associated with a significantly reduced risk of perioperative MI (relative risk reduction [RRR], 0.43) and a significantly increased risk of any
periprocedural stroke (RRR, 1.48). CAS was associated
with an increased risk of periprocedural death (RRR, 1.40)
that did not reach statistical significance. The risk of ipsilateral major stroke did not differ between the two procedures
(RRR, 1.00), although the studies were underpowered to
test this effect.
● Recommendations for selecting therapy
1. For neurologically symptomatic patients with stenosis
⬍50% or asymptomatic patients with stenosis ⬍60%
diameter reduction, optimal medical therapy is indicated. There are no data to support CAS or CEA in this
patient group (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B).
2. In most patients with carotid stenosis who are candidates for intervention, CEA is preferred to CAS for
reduction of all-cause stroke and periprocedural death
(GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B). Data from CREST
suggest that patients aged ⬍70 years may be better
treated by CAS, but these data need further confirmation.
3. Neurologically asymptomatic patients with ⱖ60% diameter stenosis should be considered for CEA for reduction of
long-term risk of stroke, provided the patient has a 3- to
