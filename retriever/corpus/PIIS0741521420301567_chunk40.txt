 was no signiﬁcant difference
in size between ruptured and nonruptured visceral aneurysms. The authors concluded that visceral

Nevertheless, several large case series of SAA management have included an observation cohort with acceptable results.93-95 General guidelines state that true
SAAs <3 cm, asymptomatic, and showing little or no
growth can be safely observed and monitored with serial
imaging studies. As indicated before, splenic artery pseudoaneurysms and SAAs in women who are either pregnant or of childbearing age should be treated
regardless of size.90,96 There is no ﬁrm evidence to
show that aneurysm calciﬁcation protects against
growth or rupture, but calciﬁed SAAs may be associated
with smaller size at initial diagnosis.94
A large review was reported from the Mayo Clinic
involving 217 patients with SAAs. Of these patients, 168
underwent nonoperative management for a mean
period of 75 months.95 The mean size in the nonoperative group was 2.1 cm with a range from 0.8 to 5 cm in
diameter. Approximately half of these aneurysms were
monitored with serial imaging, of which only 10% were
noted to have growth averaging 0.06 cm/y. No rupture
or other complications related to the SAAs occurred,
and only 3 of the original 168 required eventual intervention because of aneurysm growth. Similar results were reported by Lakin et al94 in review of the Cleveland Clinic
experience of 128 SAAs managed during a 15-year period.
This observational cohort of 66 SAAs had a mean size of
1.7 cm at presentation with a range from 0.8 to 4.2 cm.
Serial imaging was available for 94% of the aneurysms,
and these patients received an average of 2.5 CT scans
during 4.6 years of follow-up. The average growth rate
was a nominal 0.2 mm/y during 3.1 years of follow-up.
There were again no ruptures or other complications
attributed to the aneurysms in the observed group.
