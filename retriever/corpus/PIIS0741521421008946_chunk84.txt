clusion (P <
.001), and 1-year stroke or TIA (P < .003) were statistically
lower with patch closure. High-volume surgeons
increased patch use from 50% to 90%, and decreased
their 1-year stroke or TIA risk from 4.9% to 1.9% (P <
.001) and restenosis risk from 9.0% to 1.2%. The VSGNE
carotid patch quality initiative successfully increased
CEA patch closure rates.
Meta-analysis of primary closure vs CEA with patching. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
showed patching was superior to primary closure in
lowering risk of perioperative stroke, perioperative stroke
and death, late restenosis292,298,299 (Table V).
Role of selective patching. Selective patching has
been proposed for certain patients such as those with
tortuous or exceptionally small carotid artery. Although
there is no Level 1 evidence supporting selective patching
vs primary closure or routine patching. Golledge et al300
reported data for patients with selective patching of carotid arteries that were less than 5.5 to 6.0 mm. They
found no signiﬁcant difference in stroke or restenosis and
advocated selective patching of carotid arteries. Cikrit

et al301 reported similar results, but patching was selectively applied to small arteries.
Recently, Maertens et al302 reported complication rates
after CEA with selective patch angioplasty and primary
closure. Primary closure was performed when the carotid
artery had a diameter of greater than 5 mm or there was
a high carotid bifurcation, and when the contralateral carotid artery was occluded. The study concluded that primary closure was equivalent to patch angioplasty when
used in selected patients.
Avgerinos et al303 compared perioperative and longterm outcomes of different CEA closure techniques in a
large single-center retrospective study (1737 CEA). Onehalf of the patients had patch closure, with the rest
evenly distributed between eversion closure and primary
longitudinal arteriotomy closure. Although more men
had primary closure,
