 rate-controlled atrial fibrillation stopped coumadin prior
to a colonoscopy 1 week ago. He is otherwise healthy and takes no other medications.
He presents with pain in his left calf after walking two miles in 90 degree temperatures.
He is found to have both absent pulses and doppler signals in both his dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial arteries in that leg. This is accompanied by pallor and pain. What is the
most likely etiology?
A. Embolus as a result of his atrial fibrillation.
B. Embolus that originated from an aortic plaque.
C. Paradoxical embolus.

D. Thrombosis from hypotension.
E. Thrombosis from hypercoagulability
Answer
A. Embolus as a result of his atrial fibrillation.
Discussion: The two major causes of acute arterial occlusion are emboli and thrombosis.
An embolic source accounts for 80% of cases. Sources of emboli include the heart, usually
in patients with a history of atrial fibrillation or myocardial infarction or valvular heart
disease. A proximal arterial source, usually an atherosclerotic plaque or aneurysm, or a
paradoxical emboli, in which venous emboli cross a patent foramen ovale to embolize in
the arterial tree, are also common sources of an occlusive embolus. The most common
sites in the lower extremity for emboli to become lodged are, in descending order, the
femoral, iliac, aorta, and popliteal arteries. While a paradoxical embolus is possible, it is
less common. This patient is relatively healthy, so hypotension is unlikely. The patient
is not hypercoagulable.
4. A 68-year-old man with a history of uncontrolled diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension presents to the emergency department for pain in his left leg. A computed
tomography angiogram shows a cutoff sign at the left femoral at the bifurcation of the
superficial femoral artery and the profunda femoris artery. Which of the following physical examination findings would be seen in this man if your suspected etiology is an acute
arterial embolism?
A. Reprodu
