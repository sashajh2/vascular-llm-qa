0.06-0.68) for the lower arm
autogenous subgroup and 1.29 (95% CI, 0.43-3.91) for
the upper arm autogenous subgroup (P ⫽ .03 ). An overall
summary of the evidence derived from this systematic review is presented in Table I. Autogenous hemodialysis
access options can be maximized by using venous transposition procedures (eg, the radial– basilic forearm transposition or the brachial– basilic upper arm transposition) when
direct arteriovenous anastomosis autogenous access options are not available.4,57,72,73

3.2. Values and preferences
The recommendation for autogenous access places
high value on optimizing patient outcomes by minimizing
the risks of death and infection and maximizing durability.
Prioritization of forearm access places high value on the
preservation of proximal veins or future access placement.
This recommendation places a lower value on competing
considerations such as higher reimbursement for construction of prosthetic, availability of ready to use off-the-shelf
prosthetic grafts, and a shorter period of time for the access
to be ready for hemodialysis.
3.3. Technical remarks
Despite the lack of evidence, some helpful techniques
may encourage the maturation of the autogenous access.
Gentle flushing of the distal end of the vein with heparinized saline allows for evaluation of the caliber and extent of
the vein and identification of side branches for ligation
through stab incisions after performing the anastomosis.
This encourages flow in the main venous segment, allowing
