lower proﬁle delivery sheaths that are tapered, ﬂexible,
and coated for low-resistance introduction into the
femoral arteries. Concomitantly, devices have been
designed to facilitate percutaneous closure of femoral
artery puncture sites of increasing dimension. Together,
these have reduced the requirement for open surgical
exposure of the femoral artery. A randomized study
comparing open exposure and the percutaneous “preclose” technique using the Perclose ProGlide (Abbott
Vascular, Santa Clara, Calif) device demonstrated both
safety and effectiveness.314 After femoral artery access,
systemic anticoagulation with 100 units/kg of intravenous heparin is recommended with a target activated
clotting time $300 seconds.
