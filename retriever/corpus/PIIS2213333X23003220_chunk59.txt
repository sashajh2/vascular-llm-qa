 discussed, however, compression for 1 week after
endothermal treatment has also been useful for pain
reduction, without MPFF treatment.
Clinical beneﬁt of ruscus extracts.
Rationale. Ruscus extracts increase capillary resistance
and reduce capillary ﬁltration.119
Evidence. A systematic review and meta-analysis120
included 20 RCT vs placebo, ﬁve vs comparative VAD
(hydroxyrutosides and MPFF), and six observational
studies, with a total of 10,246 patients (Table IX).
