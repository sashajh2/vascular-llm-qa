 vascular cell adhesion
molecule-1, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, asymmetric dimethylarginine, b-2 macroglobulin, and cystatin C
are novel risk factors whose clinical utility for predicting
PAD onset or progression is not yet clear.23-32
2. DIAGNOSIS
Measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the
primary method for establishing the diagnosis of PAD. An
ABI of #0.90 has been demonstrated to have high sensitivity and speciﬁcity for the identiﬁcation of PAD compared
with the gold standard of invasive arteriography.9 Additional
tests, such as carotid intima-media thickness33,34 and
brachial artery ﬂow-mediated dilation,35-37 have shown
promise but have not been broadly applied because they
require more specialized equipment and technical expertise.
