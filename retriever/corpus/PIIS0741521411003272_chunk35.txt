We suggest that venous plethysmography be used selectively for the
noninvasive evaluation of the venous system in patients with simple
varicose veins (CEAP class C2).
We recommend that venous plethysmography be used for the noninvasive
evaluation of the venous system in patients with advanced chronic
venous disease if duplex scanning does not provide definitive
information on pathophysiology (CEAP class C3-C6).

We recommend that in patients with varicose veins and more advanced
chronic venous disease, computed tomography venography, magnetic
resonance venography, ascending and descending contrast venography,
and intravascular ultrasonography are used selectively for indications,
including but not limited to post-thrombotic syndrome, thrombotic or
nonthrombotic iliac vein obstruction (May-Thurner syndrome), pelvic
congestion syndrome, nutcracker syndrome, vascular malformations,
venous trauma, tumors, and planned open or endovascular venous
interventions.

tests are not routinely performed. In those with recurrent
DVT, thrombosis at a young age, or thrombosis in an
unusual site, we recommend screening for throm
