 disease,9,135 improvements in
technology and endovascular techniques have resulted in
EVT replacing open surgical bypass as a primary treatment
for both focal and advanced AIOD in many cases. For iliac
angioplasty using stents, long-term results compare favorably
with open surgery.135-139 Other techniques, including devices for crossing long-segment total occlusions,140 stent
grafts,141,142 and hybrid procedures143,144 combining iliac
stenting with femoral endarterectomy or with FFB are alternatives to aortofemoral surgical reconstructions in appropriate patients with suitable anatomy. Open surgery is
generally now reserved for patients with such extensive disease that EVT is impossible or ill advised, in patients with severe disease and associated aortic aneurysms, and in those
with failed endovascular interventions (Table III).

interventions
Aortic disease. Although open surgical reconstruction
for aortic occlusive disease is considered the gold standard,145,146 there is no question the incidence of aortic and
iliac interventions is increasing, and interventional therapies
have become more commonly used in treating this condition.134 There are limited data providing information

regarding the use of interventional therapy for treatment of
aortic occlusive disease. Although initial information reported
the use of angioplasty as a method of dealing with aortic
occlusive disease,147 stenting is the most commonly used
approach in this vascular bed. Primary technical success rates
for intervention vary from 90% to 100%, with 1-year primary
patency rates from 75% to 100% and 4-year primary patency
rates of 60% to 80%. Secondary patency can usually be maintained with repeat percutaneous interventional therapy, with
1-year and 5-year secondary patency noted to be 90% to 100%
and 60% to 100%, respectively.148-150
Percutaneous approaches can be achieved through a
femoral or brachial approach or combinations of the two approaches. Stent types used include balloon-expandable and
