Diagnostic accuracy of imaging for
AAA compared with digital
subtraction angiography

d

Screening (primarily in men >65 years) was associated with reduction in AAA mortality (high); absolute reduction: 4 per 1000; number needed to
screen: 238
The mean reported sensitivities and speciﬁcities were
as follows:
DUS: 81% and 91.1%
CTA: 84.3% and 98.4%
d MRA: 95.8% and 95.8%

d

Non-radiologist-performed ultrasound achieved
acceptable sensitivity and speciﬁcity for both detection and measurement of AAA

d

Rupture was higher in women, in smokers, and with
elevated blood pressure (moderate)
For each 0.5-cm increase in AAA diameter, growth
rates increased on average by 0.59 mm/y and
rupture rates increased by a factor of 1.91
(moderate)

Treatment
EVAR had lower 30-day or in-hospital mortality rate
(high)
d Reduction in quality of life at 3 months was more
pronounced with open repair
d At 2 and 4 years, no difference in mortality (low)
d EVAR required more reinterventions and was associated with increased late rupture (high)
d

Elective EVAR was associated with lower immediate
postoperative mortality and morbidity (low, observational data)

d

EVAR was associated with a decreased risk of
