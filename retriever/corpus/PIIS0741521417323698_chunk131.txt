In the absence of ongoing blood loss, we suggest a threshold
for blood transfusion during or after aneurysm repair at a
hemoglobin concentration of 7 g/dL or below.

pain management, including multimodal techniques
such as central regional blockage with local anesthetics.626 The geriatric population warrants special
consideration, and incorporation of acetaminophen is
recommended in the postoperative pain plan.626
A Cochrane analysis reviewed 1498 patients enrolled in
15 trials who were treated with either epidural or systemic opioid analgesia, most often after open aortic surgery.627 The method of pain control had no impact on
30-day mortality, but initial pain scores, duration of ventilation, postoperative respiratory failure, gastrointestinal
bleeding, ICU length of stay, and incidence of MI were
all reduced among patients treated with epidural analgesia.627,628 Epidural anesthesia may also be beneﬁcial
for patients with COPD.629 Complications after the placement of an epidural catheter are uncommon but include
epidural abscess and hematoma.630
There is limited evidence that a preincisional transversus abdominis plane block decreases the use of pain
medication after major abdominal surgery.631,632
A Cochrane review of eight studies with 358 participants
found that a transversus abdominis plane block reduced
opioid consumption in a subset of studies and had no
impact on nausea, vomiting, or sedation scores.633
We recommend multimodality treatment, including epidural
analgesia, for postoperative pain control after OSR of an
