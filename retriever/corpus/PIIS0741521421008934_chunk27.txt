Many patients present outside this 6-hour therapeutic
window. Intervention for these patients is directed at
the carotid bifurcation rather than the intracranial circulation, with the goal of preventing recurrent events rather
than re-establishing intracranial ﬂow in the occluded
arteries.
However, for patients with acute stroke who present
obtunded or severely neurologically debilitated, it is

often necessary to delay CEA because they could have a
greater risk of hemorrhagic transformation of an infarct
or intracerebral hemorrhage. Patients with a signiﬁcant
neurologic deﬁcit (modiﬁed Rankin scale score >2),
with an area of infarction >30% of the middle cerebral
artery territory and those with altered consciousness
should not undergo CEA until signiﬁcant neurologic
improvement has occurred. Factors that have been
found to inﬂuence outcomes include the extent of
hemispheric involvement, the time to the initiation of
therapy, time to perfusion, patient age, blood glucose,
and female sex. The most important of these appears
to be the degree of hemispheric involvement (<30% of
middle cerebral artery by volume), time to reperfusion,
and age.51-53
Patients with an acute ﬁxed deﬁcit of >6 hours’ duration and a mild to moderate deﬁcit can be considered
for carotid intervention after a period of medical stabilization. Waiting >14 days could increase the risk of recurrent neurologic events by 10% to 20%.54
Numerous series have documented the safety of early
CEA (0-14 days after the index event). In a single-center
series, Sharpe et al55 reported a 30-day death and stroke
rate of 2.4% when patients had undergone CEA within
48 hours of symptom onset. Other registry data from Germany, Sweden, the United States, and single-series reports from the United States have shown equally good
results for CEA performed within the ﬁrst week but not
within the ﬁrst 48 hours.56-59
