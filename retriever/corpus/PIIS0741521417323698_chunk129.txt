ous thromboembolism after aortic surgery
relative to earlier eras of open aortic repair. Two studies
using the NSQIP database determined that the 30-day
incidence of venous thromboembolism after open
aneurysm repair and EVAR was <2% and 1%, respectively.610,611 The risk of postoperative deep venous
thrombosis after open aneurysm repair was ﬁrst highlighted by Olin and associates, who performed postoperative venography in 50 consecutive patients.612
Although most patients were asymptomatic, 21% had
evidence of an acute deep venous thrombosis, predominantly within the calf veins.
Whereas venous thromboembolism risk stratiﬁcation
can be performed using the Caprini or similar scoring
scheme, most patients undergoing aneurysm repair will
be classiﬁed as moderate (Caprini risk score of 3 or 4) or
high (Caprini risk score >5) risk.613 For example, the majority of patients undergoing aneurysm repair will be 61
years of age or older (Caprini score of 2 points) with
planned surgery of >45 minutes (Caprini score of 2

points). These two factors alone yield a Caprini risk score
of 4. Nonetheless, recommendations for thromboprophylaxis after aneurysm surgery are not well deﬁned,
given the lack of evidence for safety, particularly among
patients undergoing OSR, or effectiveness.614-621
We recommend thromboprophylaxis that includes
intermittent pneumatic compression and early
ambulation for all patients undergoing OSR or EVAR.

A (High)

We suggest thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated or
low-molecular-weight heparin for patients undergoing
aneurysm repair at moderate to high risk for venous
thromboembolism and low risk for bleeding.

Postoperative blood transfusion. A threshold for blood
transfusion after OSR or EVAR has not been established. A
number of studies suggest that an
