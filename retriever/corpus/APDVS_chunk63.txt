 and descends through the anterior compartment of the leg. It can
be visualized as the most lateral tibial vessel during lower extremity angiogram run-offs.
The AT runs along the front of the tibia and crosses the ankle joint to become the dorsalis
pedis artery, supplying blood to the dorsum (top) of the foot.
 Posterior Tibial Artery (PT): The posterior tibial artery is another branch of the
popliteal artery. Once the AT tibial branches from the popliteal, the remaining vessel is
termed the tibeoperoneal trunk. This trunk splits to give off the posterior tibial artery
(PT) and the peroneal artery. The PT descends posteriorly in the leg and passes behind
the medial malleolus (the bony prominence on the inner side of the ankle). It can be
palpated on the medial aspect of the foot behind the medial malleolus. It continues into
the sole of the foot and forms the plantar arch, contributing to the arterial supply of the
sole of the foot and toes.
 Peroneal Artery: The peroneal artery, also known as the fibular artery, is the third
major branch of the popliteal artery. As mentioned, it originated from tibioperoneal
trunk along with the PT. The peroneal artery runs along the lateral side of the leg and
supplies the lateral compartment muscles. In the ankle region, it anastomoses with the
branches of the posterior tibial artery, providing collateral circulation.
 Dorsalis Pedis Artery (DP): The dorsalis pedis artery is a continuation of the anterior
tibial artery. It extends along the anterior aspect of the ankle and runs atop the dorsum
(top) of the foot. It can be palpated on the dorsum of the foot just lateral to the tender
of extensor hallucis longus. It plays a crucial role in supplying blood to the dorsal surface
of the foot and the toes. The presence and palpability of the dorsalis pedis pulse are

often evaluated as part of a clinical assessment to determine arterial perfusion in the
foot.
In summary, the common femoral artery is the arterial origin of the leg. It gives rise to the
superficial femoral artery, and subsequently, the pop
