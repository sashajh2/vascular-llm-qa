 superﬁcial or deep truncal vein.
1.3.3. A deﬁnition of “pathologic” perforating veins in
patients with varicose veins (CEAP clinical class C2 includes those with an outward ﬂow duration of
>500 ms and a diameter of >3.5 mm on DUS.

Good Practice Statements.
1.4.1. We recommend that evaluation of reﬂux with
DUS be performed in an Intersocietal Accreditation
Commission or American College of Radiology
accredited vascular laboratory by a credentialed ultrasonographer, with the patient standing whenever
possible. A sitting or reverse Trendelenburg position
can be used if the patient cannot stand.
1.4.2. We recommend that, for evaluation of reﬂux
with DUS, the sonographer use either a Valsalva maneuver or distal augmentation to assess the common
femoral vein and SFJ, and distal augmentation should
be used with either manual compression or cuff deﬂation for evaluation of more distal segments. Superﬁcial
reﬂux must be traced to its source, including the saphenous junction, truncal or perforating veins, or pelvic
origin varicose veins. The study should be interpreted
by a physician trained in venous DUS interpretation.
1.4.3. We recommend that a complete DUS examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities includes
transverse grayscale images without and with transducer compression of the common femoral vein, proximal, mid, and distal femoral veins, popliteal veins, the
SFJ, and at least two segments along the GSV and SSV.
1.4.4. We recommend that a complete DUS examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities includes
measurement of the spectral Doppler waveform using
calipers. Reﬂux at baseline and in response to Valsalva
or distal augmentation in the common femoral vein
and at the SFJ should be documented. Reﬂux in
response to distal augmentation in the midfemoral
and popliteal veins, GSV at the prox
