 scorematched patients from the VQI with symptomatic carotid disease. This study demonstrated that TCAR was
associated with signiﬁcantly lower risk of in-hospital
stroke or death compared with transfemoral CAS (2.1%
vs 4.2%; absolute difference, 2.02% [95% CI, 3.21%
to 0.83%]; RR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.75]; P < .001).207
There was no difference in MI between the groups. Last,
Malas et al208 examined a more recent cohort of patient
from the VQI Trans-carotid Revascularization Project.
These investigators propensity score-matched 6384 pairs
of patients who had undergone either TCAR or CEA. In
this cohort there were 3333 symptomatic patients that
were compared. There was no difference in in-hospital
stroke and death between symptomatic patients undergoing TCAR vs CEA (2.2% vs 2.6%; P ¼ .46) and TCAR
was associated with a lower incidence of CNI and shorter
hospital stay. The impact of developing a TCAR program
on overall carotid revascularization outcomes was
examined by Columbo et al.209 These investigators
compared the risk of MACE deﬁned as stroke, death and
MI in centers who performed only CEA vs those centers
that performed both CEA and TCAR. At 1 year, the incidence of MACE was 10% lower at centers that performed
both TCAR and CEA vs CEA alone (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.810.99; P ¼ .04).209 These studies seem to be promising and
have been supported by a clinical competency statement from the SVS210 and although it is important to
remember that to date the vast majority of TCAR procedures have been performed in patients at high
anatomic or medical risk for CEA the procedure appears
promising and further data in low-risk symptomatic patients are awaited.
