igation and stripping of the saphenous vein if technology or expertise
in endovenous ablation is not available or if the
venous anatomy precludes endovenous treatment.
Level of recommendation: grade 1 (strong), quality of evidence: B (moderate)
2.3.2. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and
axial reﬂux in the anterior accessory or the posterior
accessory great saphenous vein, we suggest treatment with ligation and stripping of the accessory
great saphenous vein, with additional phlebectomy, if needed, if technology or expertise in endovenous ablations is not available or if the venous
anatomy precludes endovenous treatment.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak), quality of evidence: C (low to very low)
2.4.1. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and
axial reﬂux in the great saphenous vein who place
a high priority on the long-term outcomes of treatment (quality of life and recurrence), we suggest
treatment with endovenous laser ablation, radiofrequency ablation, or high ligation and stripping over
physician-compounded ultrasound-guided foam
sclerotherapy.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak) quality of evidence: B (moderate)
2.4.2. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and
axial reﬂux in the small saphenous vein who place
a high priority on the long-term outcomes of treatment (quality of life and recurrence), we suggest
treatment with laser ablation, radiofrequency ablation, or ligation and stripping from the knee to the
upper or mid-calf over physician-compounded ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak) quality of evidence: C (low to very low)
2.4.3. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and
axial reﬂux in the anterior accessory or posterior
accessory great saphenous vein who place a high
priority on the long-term outcomes of treatment
(quality of life and recurrence), we suggest treatment of the reﬂuxing superﬁcial trunk with endovenous laser ablation, radiofrequency ablation, or
high ligation and stripping, with additional phlebectomy, if needed, over
