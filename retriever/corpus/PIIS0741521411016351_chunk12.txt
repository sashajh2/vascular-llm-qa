Clinical Expert Consensus Panel on Carotid Stenting recommended screening for asymptomatic patients with carotid bruit who are potential candidates for carotid intervention and for those in whom coronary artery bypass
grafting (CABG) is planned.26
a. Screening patients with asymptomatic bruit. Zhu
and Norris,27 in the largest reported study of carotid
screening in asymptomatic patients, reported the prevalence of carotid stenosis ⬎75% for those with a carotid bruit
was 1.2%. Although the presence of a neck bruit has not
been found to predict carotid stenosis ⬎60% in a neurologically asymptomatic population,27 focal ipsilateral carotid
bruits in neurologically symptomatic patients had a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 61% for high-grade carotid
stenosis (range, 70%-99%).28 The absence of a bruit did not
significantly change the probability of significant stenosis in
this group of patients (pretest, 52%; post-test, 40%). Ratchford et al29 found in a selected high-risk subgroup of
asymptomatic patients that if a bruit was heard, 25% had a
⬎60% stenosis. The presence of carotid bruit has been
shown to increase the absolute risk of stroke,30-32 MI, and
death.33 In general population-based studies, the prevalence of severe bifurcation stenosis is not high enough to
make bruit alone an indication for carotid screening. With
these facts in mind, screening should be pursued only if a

bruit is associated with other risk factors for stenosis and
stroke in patients who have a low operative risk5,6,12,34 and
are willing to undergo carotid intervention, whether CEA
or CAS.
