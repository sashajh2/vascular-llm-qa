 reﬂux <1 second; and group C, signiﬁcant reﬂux >1 second. Delayed FS was required in 12%
in group A, 14% in group B, and 89% in group C. The
improvement in Aberdeen Varicose Vein Severity Score
at 6 weeks was 86.2% in group A, 82.1% in group B, and
59.1% in group C (P < .001 vs A and B). While EVLA of the
above-knee GSV improved all patients, those with
persistent reﬂux in the below-knee GSV had the least
improvement. In a different study of 50 patients with
complete GSV reﬂux, 16 patients had EVLA in the aboveknee and below-knee GSV in separate sessions, 34 patients had EVLA in the above-knee and below-knee GSV
in the same session.154 Patients with complete GSV reﬂux
complained of ankle pain and swelling. At 11 months, all
patients had resolution of their ankle pain, with 44 patients having resolution of swelling. There were four instances of paresthesias.154 Carradice et al randomized
surgical stripping vs EVLA for treatment of varicose veins.
Twelve of 23 recurrences of varicosities were due to an
incompetent below-knee GSV. GSV ablation in this study
could be safely performed in the distal leg.155 Gifford et al
treated 79 limbs with below-knee-GSV EVLT or RFA for
reﬂux at this site, 43 had Class 1 to 3 disease. Only three
patients (4%) suffered transient paresthesia.
5.2.6. In patients with an epifascial or superﬁcial
saphenous vein, thermal ablation may result in skin
burns, hyperpigmentation, or induration, while
nonthermal techniques may cause hyperpigmentation
or induration. Miniphlebectomy or limited stripping is
safe and effective, if the saphenous vein is close to
the skin (<0.5 cm).
