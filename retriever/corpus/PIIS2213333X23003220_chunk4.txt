cation system for
chronic venous disorders. The clinical or basic CEAP classiﬁcation can be used for clinical practice, and the full CEAP
classiﬁcation system should be used for clinical research.

1.1.2.

We recommend the use of the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) for patients with chronic venous disorders for
grading of clinical severity and for assessment of post treatment outcome.

Guideline

Grade of
Recommendation

For patients with chronic venous disease of the lower extremities, we recommend DUS as 1 (strong)
the diagnostic test of choice to evaluate for venous reﬂux.

Implementation remarks
1.3.1.

Reﬂux is deﬁned as a minimum value >500 ms of reversed ﬂow in the superﬁcial truncal veins (great saphenous vein [GSV],
small saphenous vein [SSV], anterior accessory great saphenous vein [AAGSV], and posterior accessory great saphenous vein
[PAGSV]) and in the tibial, deep femoral, and perforating veins. A minimum value of >1 second of reversed ﬂow is diagnostic
of reﬂux in the common femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins. There is no minimum diameter required to have pathologic
reﬂux.

1.3.2.

Axial reﬂux of the GSV is deﬁned as uninterrupted retrograde venous ﬂow from the groin to the upper calf. Axial reﬂux in the
SSV is deﬁned as being from the knee to the ankle. Axial reﬂux in the AAGSV and PAGSV is retrograde ﬂow between two
measurements, at least ﬁve cm apart. Retrograde ﬂow can occur in the superﬁcial or deep veins, with or without perforating
veins. Junctional reﬂux is limited to the saphenofemoral (SFJ) or saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ). Segmental reﬂux occurs in
only a portion of a superﬁcial or deep truncal vein.
