aphenous trunk. No recurrent
bleeding was noted after a mean follow-up of
17.4 months.272 A larger series reported successful acute
control of bleeding in 72 patients treated with FS.271 In
comparison with 52 patients treated with simple suture
ligation, FS was associated with faster wound healing (7
vs 14 days; P < .001) and a lower risk of recurrent
bleeding at 12 months (0% vs 23%, P < .001). Others
have similarly reported excellent control of bleeding
from smaller veins (<1 mm) with sclerotherapy, while
bleeding from larger veins was successfully controlled
with high ligation, stripping, and phlebectomy. Recurrent bleeding was noted in only 1 of 14 patients (7%)
after a mean follow-up of 21.3 months.267 Venous
ablation has been used more recently in patients with
varicosities, with small series (n ¼ 13) demonstrating
85% of patients to be free from recurrent bleeding at a
mean follow-up of 2.26 years.265
Although the supportive evidence is quite limited, the
literature does suggest that acute bleeding is optimally
managed with sclerotherapy, while prevention of recurrence may warrant ablation of any truncal venous
incompetence.
14. Management of superﬁcial vein aneurysms
14.1. For patients with superﬁcial truncal vein aneurysm, located within 3 cm of the SFJ or SPJ, open surgical excision, with high proximal and distal ligations
should be performed. If symptomatic saphenous reﬂux
is present, endovenous or open surgical ablation (phlebectomy or limited stripping) of the distal saphenous
vein should be performed.
Consensus statement.
14.2. For patients with an asymptomatic superﬁcial
truncal vein aneurysm, located >3 cm distal to the
SFJ, endovenous ablation alone should be performed.
Thromboprophylaxis in these patients reduces the
risk of VTE.
