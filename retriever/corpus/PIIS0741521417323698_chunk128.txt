Nasogastric decompression and perioperative nutrition. Routine nasogastric decompression is not recommended after aortic surgery. A Cochrane review
examined 37 studies involving 5711 patients randomized
to routine or selective nasogastric decompression after
emergency or elective abdominal surgery.606 Selective
decompression was associated with a decreased risk of
pulmonary complications without untoward adverse effects.606 Although postoperative malnutrition is uncommon after EVAR, given the anticipated short length of
hospital stay,607 a risk for malnutrition exists for patients
who undergo open aneurysm repair, particularly those
with pre-existing renal insufﬁciency.608 Early feeding reduces the likelihood of malnutrition, as demonstrated in
a randomized trial of 128 patients undergoing colorectal
and abdominal vascular surgery.609
We recommend optimization of preoperative nutritional
status before elective open aneurysm repair if repair will not
be unduly delayed.

We recommend using nasogastric decompression
intraoperatively for all patients undergoing open aneurysm
repair but postoperatively only for those patients with
nausea and abdominal distention.

We recommend parenteral nutrition if a patient is unable to
tolerate enteral support 7 days after aneurysm repair.

Prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis. Early mobilization and shorter length of stay have reduced the incidence of venous thromboembolism after aortic surgery
relative to earlier eras of open aortic repair. Two studies
using the NSQIP database determined that the 30-day
incidence of venous thromboembolism after open
aneurysm repair and EVAR was <2% and 1%, respectively.610,611 The risk of postoperative deep venous
thrombosis after open aneurysm repair was ﬁ
