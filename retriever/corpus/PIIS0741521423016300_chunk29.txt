a small amount (PLR 1.69 e 2.40) with limited ability of the
test to exclude disease (NLR 0.53 e 0.75).56,59,62,63 Similarly,
data for the TBI were limited and variable with the PLR in
both mixed populations (with and without DFU) and DFU
only, ranging from 1.62 (indicating limited ability to diagnose disease) to being diagnostic (PLR $ 10) and indicating the test has small to moderate ability to exclude
disease (NLR 0.30 e 0.47).56,59,61,62
All the aforementioned non-invasive bedside tests (ABI,
TBI, CWD) can be applied by a wide range of

practitioners, in particular in settings where people are
treated in secondary care or specialised outpatient foot
clinics. These tests have low resource requirements relative to other methods of diagnosing PAD such as CDUS
and angiography. These factors are likely to increase equity in healthcare access and make the tests feasible and
acceptable for both the person having the tests and
healthcare providers. Given the large potential beneÔ¨Åcial
effect and its impact on subsequent treatment a Strong
Recommendation for this population has been made,
although the limitations of the evidence base are
acknowledged.
Recommendation 5
In a person with diabetes without a foot ulcer in whom a nonemergency invasive foot procedure is being considered, peripheral artery disease should be excluded by performing
assessment of pedal Doppler waveforms in combination with
ankle brachial index and toe brachial index.

Best Practice Statement

Rationale. Except when required as an emergency to
control severe infection, all people with diabetes who
require foot surgery should have vascular testing consisting of pedal Doppler waveforms in combination with ABI
and toe pressure (TP) or TBI. Non-emergency invasive
procedures, such as elective surgery, may be indicated in
people with diabetes without a DFU with the intent to
address painful foot conditions. Particularly in those with
peripheral neuropathy,64 prophylactic procedures could
be considered to address risk factors for foot ulceration,
such as foot deformity and elevated localised plantar
pressures.
