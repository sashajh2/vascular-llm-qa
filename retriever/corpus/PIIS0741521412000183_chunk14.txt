Indirect findings in the common femoral vein, including continuous venous flow, absent respiratory variation,
and continuous flow with Valsalva, may suggest proximal
obstruction but cannot exclude nonocclusive thrombus or
extrinsic compression. Contrast venography may similarly
fail to demonstrate the pelvic veins due to contrast dilution
by the unopacified deep pelvic veins.42
Because multiple venous segments are usually concurrently involved, a diagnosis of DVT can most often be
established independently of evaluating the iliac veins.
However, for the reasons cited in recommendation 1.1,
establishing the most proximal extent of thrombosis is
important in those patients, who may be candidates for
early thrombus removal. Involvement of the iliac veins has
been reported in up to 23% of patients when complete
color-flow ultrasound imaging, including the iliac veins, is
performed.41 Isolated pelvic vein thrombosis has been reported in 1% to 4% of studies using venography or ultrasound imaging, and evidence shows both of these modalities underestimate the true incidence of isolated pelvic vein
thrombosis.43,44 Computed tomography venography
(CTV) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) are
better able to evaluate the IVC and pelvic veins than
ultrasound imaging or contrast venography. Although
likely biased by referral patterns, Spritzer44 found involvement of the pelvic veins in 43.8% of 167 consecutive
positive MRV studies. Thrombus was isolated to the pelvic
veins in 20.4% of these positive studies. Ultrasound imaging failed to detect isolated iliac thrombosis in all seven
patients undergoing ultrasound imaging and MRV.
CTV may be performed by direct contrast administration into a foot vein or by indirect injection through an arm
vein.45 Indirect CTV may be performed as part of imaging
protocols for pulmonary embolism (PE)46 and avoids the
need for foot vein puncture in a swollen limb. Pooled
analysis of 13 studies comparing CTV vs ultrasound imaging or venography (largely in patients presenting with
symptoms of PE) showed an overall sensitivity and specificity of 95.9% and 95.
