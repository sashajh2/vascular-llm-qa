reported cases of rapid arterial transformation.

We suggest postembolization surveillance every 1 to 2 years with axial
imaging to assess for vascular remodeling and evidence of aneurysm
reperfusion.

In patients who are thought to have HAA, we recommend CTA as the diagnostic
tool of choice.

In patients with HAA who are considered for intervention, we recommend
mesenteric angiography for preoperative planning.

HAA is the second most common type of visceral artery
aneurysm reported.56,98,134 The actual incidence of HAA is
unknown; the commonly used incidence ﬁgures are
derived from small case series, autopsy, and anecdotal
evidence. In a large series reported from the Mayo Clinic,
the incidence of HAA was noted to be 0.002% among
the 2,091,965 patients seen at the Mayo Clinic between
1980 and 1986.150 Most HAAs are diagnosed incidentally

on CT performed for unrelated issues and are most
commonly observed during the sixth decade of life
with a 3:2 male predominance.150
Given the numerous collaterals from the gastroduodenal artery and right gastric branches, both open surgical ligation and endovascular embolization of these
aneurysms are reported. To evaluate the collaterals, selective angiography and high-resolution CTA are
recommended.
