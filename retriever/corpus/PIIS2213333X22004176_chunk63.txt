were found for other outcomes such as deep vein thrombosis, recurrent varicosity, recurrent ulceration, edema,

In a recent retrospective study of 1070 patients with
CVD (CEAP class C2-C6), including 470 C2 patients,
PEM ablation (Varithena;, BTG International Ltd, London,
UK) was compared with EVLA using the VenaCure 1470nm laser system (Angiodynamics, Waterlooville, UK).
Reﬂux was eliminated in 93.5% (514 of 550) and 92.8%

(482 of 520) of the PEM- and EVLA-treated patients during an average follow-up of 3 years. No neurologic or cardiac adverse events had occurred after PEM treatment.
PEM appears to be a promising new technology; however, the only RCT currently available had compared endovenous microfoam with placebo to conﬁrm its safety and
