 selection of the CCA. A glide wire is advanced
into the mid CCA. Some catheters are compatible with
the 6F guiding sheath, which allow for telescoping the
sheath over the catheter and the glide wire without exchange to dilator. The sheath is advanced into the mid to
distal CCA, avoiding the lesion. The use of a stiff wire into
the ECA may facilitate advancing the sheath into the
mid/distal CCA. The sheath should be ﬂushed carefully
with heparinized saline to avoid air embolization.367
Certain anatomic conditions such as severe aortoiliac
disease, unfavorable aortic arch conﬁguration (type II or
III), bovine arch anatomy, and supra-aortic vessel takeoff can render Transfemoral CAS more difﬁcult.175,359,368
Patients with complex aortic arch anatomy and patients
greater than 80 years of age are at high risk of cerebral
embolization during CAS owing to manipulation of the
aortic arch and major vessels before placement of an
EPD. In an MRI-based, prospective single-center study,
40% of patients undergoing transfemoral CAS had evidence of cerebral embolization with 60% of the cerebral
infarcts being outside the vascular territory of the treated
lesion, observations suggesting that emboli originated
from the aortic arch.369 In the Carotid ACCULINK/ACCUNET Post Approval Trial to Uncover Unanticipated or
Rare Events (CAPTURE) postapproval study, nearly one
in ﬁve strokes occurred in a nonipsilateral distribution,
with the exception of intraprocedural events, which
were all ipsilateral to the stent being implanted.370
Radial and brachial access. CAS from upper extremity
approaches can be performed safely and is effective in
treating both left- and right-sided carotid lesions in patients with type III and bovine arch anatomy. These approaches are patient selective, and used based on the
operator’s experience. A preprocedural Allen’s test and
careful review of all imaging studies should be performed before considering these approaches.371 However, such access is technically difﬁcult for catheterization
of a nonbovine left I
