 ligation and division implies ligation
and division of the GSV at its confluence with the common
femoral vein, including ligation and division of all upper
GSV tributaries.51 Partial or complete preservation of the
upper GSV tributaries, when the GSV is ligated, stripped,
or ablated, must therefore be clearly stated. The term
stripping means removal of a long vein segment, usually of
the saphenous vein, by means of a device.51
The SFJ is dissected through a 3- to 4-cm-long oblique
incision made in the groin crease just lateral to the femoral
artery. The cosmetic appearance of the scar of such an
incision is excellent. The SFJ is dissected bluntly and
sharply, minimizing injury to the surrounding lymphatic
tissue to avoid lymphatic leak or lymphedema. The anterior
wall of the common femoral vein is always visualized to
ensure accurate ligation of the SFJ. All tributaries are ligated and divided, preferably to the secondary branches,177
although firm evidence to support the need for this is not
available. During dissection of the SFJ, the external pudendal artery is carefully preserved. Flush ligation of the saphenous vein is performed by double-ligating the vein with
nonabsorbable suture close to the SFJ. It is important to
avoid narrowing the femoral vein but equally important to
minimize chances for a cul-de-sac in the saphenous vein
stump.
To perform stripping, a flexible Codman stripper is
often used for invagination stripping, without the removable acorn. The saphenous vein is tied to the tip of the
stripper, and the vein is inverted into its lumen as the
stripper is pulled down through a small incision made
below the knee. Alternatively, an Oesch PIN stripper can be
used.168,169 Saphenous stripping below the knee is rarely
performed today because of an increased incidence of reported saphenous nerve injury.165 To decrease bleeding in
the saphenous tunnel after stripping, we suggest that the
