 also requires physician expertise to correctly interpret a DU study. DU was recommended as the diagnostic test of choice for patients
with CVD in previous SVS/AVF guidelines and in a
consensus document from the International Union of
Phlebology.20,38,39 The 2016 Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Advisory Committee panel40

ﬁnd sufﬁcient evidence to support or refute the recommendations to use DU as the ﬁrst-line diagnostic
test to evaluate CVD.
Evidence. Combining the data from two prospective
comparative studies,42,43 a recent systematic review
found that using DU scanning for the evaluation of CVD
changed the management for 10% to 25% of the patients,

who had undergone hand-held continuous wave Doppler
(HHD) ultrasound (Table I).19 Mercer et al42 compared the
HHD ultrasound ﬁndings with those of DU and found that
the HHD sensitivity to detect reﬂux was only 73% at the
saphenofemoral junction (SFJ), 77% at the saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ), and 51% for thigh perforator veins.
Thus, treatment determined using HHD ultrasound
would have left residual sites of reﬂux in 24% of the cases.
Rautio et al45 observed that the HHD ultrasound sensitivity was 56% at the SFJ and only 23% at the SPJ and
concluded that the DU ﬁndings would modify the treatment decision for 9.1%. Darke et al44 found better HHD
ultrasound sensitivity at the SFJ (95%) but concluded that
HHD ultrasound was not satisfactory for the evaluation of
reﬂux at the SPJ. Another study by Wills et al47 found HHD
ultrasound sensitivity of 71% at the SFJ and concluded
that 29% of the limbs would have had sites of reﬂux left
untreated without a DU evaluation. Dhillon et al46 recently
