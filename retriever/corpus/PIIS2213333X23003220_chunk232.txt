 ﬂow (P <
.0001) as well as transcutaneous oxygen pressure (P <
.0001). Another RCT, in 260 patients CEAP C2 to C4,305
evaluated leg volume by water displacement volumetry
and noted marked dose-dependent difference favoring
AS 195 group (P < .001), parallel to the ankle/calf
circumference pattern (P < .001). The third trial
conﬁrmed previous results in 248 patients with varicose
veins and CEAP C3 to C4a.306 Pain improvement and
decrease of the leg volume assessed by water displacement volumetry vs placebo were signiﬁcant; P ¼ .047 and
P ¼ .0268 respectively. Safety of AS 195 treatment was
excellent. In a recent systematic review307 signiﬁcant
improvement of symptoms and edema was observed in
some studies. The safety of Red vine leaf extract treatment was excellent.
Clinical beneﬁt of sulodexide.
Rationale. Sulodexide contain a puriﬁed glycosaminoglycan mixture of low molecular weight heparin (80%)
and dermatan sulfate (20%), components of glycocalyx
glycoproteins.101 Protection of glycocalyx integrity is
essential in the preservation of the vascular endothelial
function and mitigation of the inﬂammatory reaction.
Evidence. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 13
studies with sulodexide19 included 1901 participants with
CVD at any stage of the disease, classiﬁed or nonclassiﬁed,
was considered. Sulodexide decreased the intensity of
pain, cramps, heaviness, edema, total symptom score and
reduced inﬂammatory mediators in patients with CVD.
In a meta-analysis comparing efﬁcacy of different
VADs15 sulodexide was included only in a single network
meta-analysis for the proportion of patients with

complete ulcer healing and it showed to have the highest probability of being the best treatment (48%)
compared with pentoxifylline (37%) and MPFF (16%).
