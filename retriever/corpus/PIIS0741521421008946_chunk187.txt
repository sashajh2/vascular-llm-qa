The relationship between asymptomatic carotid stenosis
and cognitive function is still controversial. Multiple large
population-based cross-sectional and cohort studies
including the Tromsø Study, Rotterdam Study, Framingham Study, and Cardiovascular Health Study show that

subjects with asymptomatic carotid stenosis preform
signiﬁcantly worse on cognitive measures than control
subjects without carotid stenosis.614-616,619 These
population-based studies show an overall trend of
decreased cerebral blood ﬂow and increased silent infarcts on the hemisphere of the brain ipsilateral to the
carotid artery with various degree of asymptomatic stenosis. More speciﬁcally, decreased cerebral blood ﬂow
and decreased brain volume have been associated with
deterioration in various cognitive domains.620-622 In addition, studies have shown that 10% to 20% of asymptomatic patients with severe carotid stenosis have embolic
signals and these signals are higher for symptomatic patients.623,624 A linear relationship between the process of
mechanically unstable areas of carotid plaques and
cognitive decline suggests a contributory role of microembolization in silent strokes.613 Several studies showed
that embolic signals are associated with faster cognitive
deterioration and dementia in elderly despite an
absence of neurologic symptoms.625-627 Although patients with evidence of carotid stenosis have impaired
cognitive function compared with healthy controls independent of common vascular risk factors,615,628 vascular
disease shares common risk factors with cognitive
decline. These common factors include hypertension,
diabetes, and smoking, making it difﬁcult to differentiate
between causation and correlation.
The effects of revascularization procedures on cognition. Both CEA and stenting, particularly CEA, decrease
stroke risk,5,203 but the effect of carotid intervention on
cognitive function has been long debated.629
Many studies show an improvement in cognitive function after carotid revascularization procedures. Presumably, improved cerebral
