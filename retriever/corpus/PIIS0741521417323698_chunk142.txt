Prevention of an aortic graft infection. Recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis after placement of an
aortic prosthesis following OSR or EVAR have historically
followed guidelines for the prevention of infective endocarditis with a prosthetic heart valve. Recent guidelines
have sought to reduce the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis, particularly with the publication of the National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance in
2008, which recommended against antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis, regardless of the dental,
genitourinary, or gastrointestinal procedure or predisposing cardiac condition, including the presence of a prosthetic valve.720 A recent report has observed a small
but statistically signiﬁcant increase in infective endocarditis cases in the United Kingdom since the implementation of the National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence recommendations.721 Although limitations exist in this study and causation has not been
established, concerns have been raised.722 Several
investigations noted a relationship between dental
procedures and infective endocarditis in high-risk
patients.447 Current European Society of Cardiology and
ACC/AHA guidelines recommend ongoing use of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with a prosthetic valve
undergoing high-risk procedures.723,724 High-risk procedures, as deﬁned in both guidelines, include dental
procedures involving the manipulation of the gingival or
periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa, including scaling and root canal procedures.724
Both guidelines noted that there is no compelling evidence that bacteremia resulted from respiratory tract
procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures,
and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures, and
prophylaxis was not recommended for patients undergoing these procedures unless the procedures were
performed in the presence of an infection.724 It was also
