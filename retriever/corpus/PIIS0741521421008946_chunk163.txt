randomized series (CAVATAS)510 and other small
descriptive series494,509,511 failed to demonstrate superior
outcome in the endovascular management of vertebral
artery disease, with a higher incidence of carotid territory
stroke, MI, and restenosis in patients having stent
placement.
Summary and recommendations. In patients presenting with symptomatic vertebral disease causing vertebrobasilar TIA or stroke, open surgical treatment with
vertebral artery to common carotid transposition is recommended in low-risk surgical candidates.

TREATMENT OF BRACHIOCEPHALIC DISEASE
AND PROXIMAL CCA OCCLUSIVE DISEASE
Signiﬁcant stenosis or occlusion of the great vessel origins is rare with an incidence of 0.5% to 6.4%. Disease occurs in the innominate or left subclavian artery more
frequently than the left carotid.514 Many of these arch lesions are asymptomatic, although tandem lesions in the
carotid bifurcation can occur in up to 17% of patients
with arch origin lesions.514,515 Although the indications
for intervention in patients with great vessel branch disease are similar to those for CEA, there is no evidence
supporting treatment in asymptomatic patients. The
treatment of symptomatic patients with stroke/TIA or
arm ischemia is logical, but in patients without symptoms the natural history of the disease is unknown.
Intervention can be performed by open direct repair
with possible sternotomy (mini), cervical extra-anatomic
bypass or transposition, hybrid open/endovascular, or
endovascular intervention alone. Endarterectomy and
bypass procedures with sternotomy or trap-door incisions may be considered with equally excellent longterm patency, although small series suggest direct
reconstruction with endarterectomy may be superior to
bypass.516,517 In some cases, when all three arch vessels
are diseased, the ascending aorta must be used as
