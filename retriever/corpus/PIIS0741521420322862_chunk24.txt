stenosis, and was the most accurate.60 Triphasic CTA
provides excellent spatial resolution and image detail
and is considered the best study to deﬁne the
anatomic characteristics of the mesenteric lesions (eg,
lesion length, diameter, presence of thrombus, or calciﬁcation) and the potential inﬂow sites for open revascularization (eg, calciﬁcation of the supraceliac aorta)
that are required for intervention planning. Furthermore, the delayed phase can be helpful to identify
other vascular pathologies, including mesenteric
venous thrombosis. The obvious limitations of CTA
include image artifact from severe calciﬁcation or
metallic devices, the need for iodine-based contrast,
expense, and radiation exposure. CTA is also very helpful to identify other intra-abdominal pathology and is
particularly helpful in the setting of acute or subacute
mesenteric ischemia to assess the appearance of the
bowel wall with the hallmarks of ischemia being bowel
wall thickening, edema, hemorrhage, and/or hyperemia. CTA has been shown to be both sensitive (93%)
and speciﬁc (96%) for detecting bowel infarction and
perforation.61-64 Unfortunately, Karkkainen et al65 reported that only one-third of the patients who presented with AMI and an antecedent history of CMI
(ie, acute on CMI) had evidence of ischemic-speciﬁc
ﬁndings in their bowel on CT scan, and they suggested
that any bowel-related ﬁndings in patients with an
SMA obstruction should be attributed to ischemia.

CTA has also been shown to be superior to MRA after
endovascular intervention owing to better visualization
of the lumen, higher spatial resolution, and faster
acquisition times.58,66-68
MRA affords many of the same advantages as CTA for
the diagnosis of CMI and should be considered an alternative modality.66,69 Gadolinium-enhanced MRA was
shown to have an overall sensitivity and speciﬁcity of
greater than 95 % when compared with catheter
