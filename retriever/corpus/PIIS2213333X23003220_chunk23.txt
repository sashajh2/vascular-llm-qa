negative impact on physical, psychological, and social

with chronic venous insufﬁciency (CVI) may progress to
phlebolymphedema, skin changes with chronic inﬂammation, and venous leg ulcerations.5,6
The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), the American
Venous Forum (AVF), and the American Vein and

management of varicose veins of the lower extremities.8 All
recommendations in Part I were based on a new, independent systematic review and meta-analysis9 that provided
the latest scientiﬁc evidence to support updated or
completely new guidelines on evaluation with duplex
scanning and on the management of superﬁcial truncal
reﬂux in patients with varicose veins. The writing committee recognized, however, that several additional important
clinical issues need to be addressed, but many have varying
levels of scientiﬁc evidence.10-41 When a systematic review
was not available, the writing committee based ungraded
statements on a comprehensive review of the literature,
combined with unanimous consensus of the expert panel.
Part II of the guidelines focuses on the rationale and scientiﬁc evidence for prevention and management of varicose
veins with compression, medications, and nutritional supplements, as well as on evaluation and treatment of varicose
tributaries, factors affecting treatment outcomes, the management of superﬁcial vein thrombosis (SVT), thrombotic
complications of varicose vein treatments, thrombus extension following ablation, management of bleeding varicose
veins and the treatment of superﬁcial vein aneurysms. This
comprehensive document provides a list of all recommendations (Parts I-II), as well as consensus and best practice
statements to aid practitioners with up-to-date, appropriate management of patients with symptomatic lower
extremity varicose veins (Clinical
