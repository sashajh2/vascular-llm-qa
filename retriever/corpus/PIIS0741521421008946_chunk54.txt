2020 Cochrane Review showed that in symptomatic patients, transfemoral CAS was associated with higher risk
of periprocedural death or stroke than CEA, (OR, 1.70;
95% CI, 1.31-2.19; P < .0001, I2 ¼ 5%; 10 trials; 5396 participants; high certainty evidence).202
Long-term outcomes of transfemoral CAS vs CEA in
symptomatic patients have been examined in a preplanned pooled analysis of data from the EVA-3S, SPACE,
International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS), and CREST
Trials. Together, these trials randomized 4754 symptomatic patients with a greater than 50% ICA stenosis with
median follow-up of 2.0 to 6.9 years. Risk of stroke or death
within 120 days of the index procedure was 5.5% for CEA
and 8.7% for transfemoral CAS (risk difference, 3.2%; 95%
CI, 1.7-4.7). Beyond the periprocedural period of 120 days,
there was no difference in annual risk of late ipsilateral
stroke (annual event rate of 0.60% for CEA vs 0.64% for
transfemoral CAS),9 lending support to the conclusion
that both procedures have similar midterm outcomes.
However, long-term outcomes continue to favor CEA
because of its lower periprocedural stroke and death
rate. In addition, 10-year outcomes comparing CEA and
transfemoral CAS have been published. In symptomatic
patients from CREST, a combined end point of periprocedural stroke and death and 10-year ipsilateral stroke was
7.9% (95% CI, 5.
