We suggest CTA as the initial diagnostic tool of choice for CAAs.

We suggest MRA in patients with suspected CAA and pre-existing renal insufﬁciency
limiting the use of iodinated contrast material.

We suggest arteriography when noninvasive studies have not sufﬁciently demonstrated
the status of relevant collateral blood ﬂow or when endovascular intervention is

Continued surveillance, even after secondary technical
success, is imperative as the natural history of visceral artery aneurysms after endovascular treatment remains
unclear. This is especially true of saccular aneurysms
treated with coil or thrombin embolization; unlike formal
exclusion with a covered stent, these aneurysms are not
technically “excluded” from arterial circulation. Indeed,
sac thrombosis may not protect the aneurysm sac from
pressure transmitted through thrombus, and eventual
sac growth or rupture may still occur.109,110 Reports of
reperfusion and even rupture after “successful” embolization of visceral aneurysms support the notion that a
thrombosed aneurysm may not represent the deﬁnitive
treatment in all cases.111,112 Other authors also noted
that regular follow-up with duplex ultrasound or CT is
necessary for patients with visceral aneurysms treated
by embolization.113 The recanalization rates after endovascular intervention were 18% and 30%, respectively, in
two reported series.111,114

Although they were once thought to be uncommon,
CAAs are being diagnosed with increasing frequency
with the use of advanced imaging techniques.82,83 The
increasing diagnosis of incidental visceral aneurysms in
the United States is primarily related to the liberal
