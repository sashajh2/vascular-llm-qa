infused during coronary artery interventions, there is a
12% increase in the risk for CIN.131 Preprocedural hydration may be beneﬁcial, but fenoldopam, dopamine, atrial
natriuretic peptide, theophylline, and calcium channel
blockers are not.132 Preprocedural administration of oral
N-acetylcysteine is recommended for at-risk patients,
given its low cost, safety proﬁle, and mild protective
effect. However, a randomized trial of N-acetylcysteine
did not reduce the incidence of CIN after EVAR.133
Recent evidence suggests that statin therapy may be of
beneﬁt in preventing CIN. For example, two studies

suggest that initiating high-dose statin therapy 2 days
before exposure to contrast material and continuing for
3 days afterward may reduce the risk for CIN in patients
undergoing coronary interventions.134,135 A recent metaanalysis concluded that the administration of statins
along with N-acetylcysteine and intravenous saline had
clinically important and statistically signiﬁcant beneﬁts
as a prevention strategy for CIN compared with the use
of N-acetylcysteine and saline alone.136
Contrast agents with osmolality of >780 mOsm/kg
display increased nephrotoxicity. Additional nephroprotection through further reduction in osmolality was suggested by a study comparing iohexol (Omnipaque, a
low-osmolar agent; 600-800 mOsm/kg) with iodixanol
(Visipaque, an iso-osmolar agent; 290 mOsm/kg).137
However, rates of CIN for iopamidol (Isovue-370, 796
mOsm/kg, nonionic) are similar to those for iodixanol,
which suggests that other physiochemical properties,
apart from osmolarity, are important determinants of
CIN.138 Likewise, several randomized trials of ionic
and nonionic contrast agents have demonstrated no
difference in CIN
