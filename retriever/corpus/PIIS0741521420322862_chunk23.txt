ography demonstrated that a greater
than 50% stenosis of the IMA was associated with a
greater than 250 cm/s PSV with an accuracy of 95%,

whereas an IMA to aortic PSV ratio of greater than 4.0
had an accuracy of 93%.56 A second study used greater
than 200 cm/s as the criteria for a greater than 50% stenosis, but the sample size in the study was small and
there were only nine vessels that were adequately
imaged.57 Unfortunately, there are no prospective
studies examining the DUS criteria for as signiﬁcant
IMA stenosis.
Although mesenteric artery DUS is a rapid, noninvasive screening study that can often conﬁrm or refute
the presence of arterial occlusive disease, additional
imaging is required to conﬁrm the presence of
MAOD and to deﬁne the precise location and extent
of disease for operative planning. CTA provides
anatomic clarity and can exclude other potential
causes of chronic abdominal pain.6,9,58,59 The technique
employs three-dimensional multiplane reformatting
along with centerline measurements. The diagnostic
accuracy for patients with CMI has been reported to
range from 95% to 100%59 and it is recommended as
the ﬁrst-line study by the American College of Radiologists Appropriateness Criteria as well as the European
Society of Vascular Surgery Mesenteric Guidelines.8,11 A
recent prospective study compared DUS, CTA, and
mesenteric
resonance
arteriography
(MRA)
to
catheter-based arteriography as the gold standard reported that CTA provided the best image quality, the
highest level of correlation for grading the degree of
stenosis, and was the most accurate.60 Triphasic CTA
provides excellent spatial resolution and image detail
and is considered the best study to deﬁne the
anatomic characteristics of the mesenteric lesions (eg,
lesion length, diameter, presence of thrombus, or calciﬁcation) and the potential inﬂow sites for open revascularization (eg, calciﬁcation of the supraceliac aorta)
that are required for intervention planning
