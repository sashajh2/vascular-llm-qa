Systematic review245 of 14
RCTs in patients
undergoing infrainguinal
arterial bypass surgery
(including CLI)

Antiplatelet therapy
improved venous and
artiﬁcial graft patency
compared with no
treatment. More beneﬁt
in synthetic grafts

B

Systematic review240 of
22 RCTs with various
comparisons. Secondary
indirect evidence on
beneﬁts of antiplatelet
agents in reducing
cardiovascular morbidity
and mortality

Anticoagulants reduced the
risk of limb loss at the
longest follow-up (OR,
0.36; 95% CI, 0.19-0.69)
and increased primary
patency when venous
grafts were analyzed
separately (OR, 0.44; 95%
CI, 0.14-1.42). Bleeding
risk doubled compared
with antiplatelets
At 6 months
postintervention,
reocclusion was lower
with high-dose ASA þ
dipyridamole (OR, 0.40;
95% CI, 0.19-0.84), but
not for low-dose ASA þ
dipyridamole. No
signiﬁcant difference in
reocclusion or restenosis
was detected for highdose ASA vs low-dose
ASA, ASA/dipyridamole
vs vitamin K antagonists,
clopidogrel þ aspirin vs
LMWH þ warfarin, or
ticlopidine vs vitamin K
antagonists. Clopidogrel
and aspirin resulted in
fewer major bleeding
episodes compared with
LMWH þ warfarin
