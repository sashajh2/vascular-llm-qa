below knee and foot arteries.20 In many centres DSA is
typically used when MRA or CTA are not available, fail
to adequately deﬁne the arterial anatomy, or when
an endovascular intervention is planned. Arterial imaging should allow complete anatomical staging from
aorta to foot using, for example, TASC for aorto-iliac
disease and the Global Anatomic Staging System
(GLASS), described in the GVG, for infrainguinal and
pedal disease.20

people with end stage renal disease, who have a 5%
peri-operative mortality rate, 40% one year mortality
rate, and one year limb salvage rate of around 70%.101
People with signs of ischaemia, e.g., as deﬁned by WIfI
and the GVG; absent pulses and monophasic or absent
pedal Doppler waveforms, ankle pressure < 100 mmHg
or toe pressure < 60 mmHg, are very likely to have significant PAD that could impact wound healing potential
and amputation risk.20,84 The certainty of evidence in
the systematic review on the effects of revascularisation
on wound healing and amputation risk was judged to
be very low, as many important factors that can affect
outcomes were not reported, such as the availability of
vein conduit, wound care, ofﬂoading, and sufﬁcient
anatomical details about the extent and severity of the
lesions treated. Factors that inﬂuence the decision to
revascularise include the degree of limb threat (e.g.,
WIfI classiﬁcation), the amount of tissue loss, presence
of infection, co-morbidities, feasibility of the different
revascularisation options, and their risks.
As discussed in other parts of the IWGDF guidelines,
restoration of perfusion in the foot is only part of the
treatment required to optimise wound healing and to
prevent or limit tissue loss, which should be provided
by a multidisciplinary team.43 Any revascularisation procedure should be part of a comprehensive care plan
that addresses other important issues including: prompt
treatment of concurrent infection,
