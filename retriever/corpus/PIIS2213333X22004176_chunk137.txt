CORRECTION
In the March 2023 issue of the Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders, the article by Gloviczki
et al (Gloviczki P, Lawrence PF, Wasan SM, et al. The 2022 Society for Vascular Surgery, American Venous Forum, and
American Vein and Lymphatic Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of varicose veins of the
lower extremities. Part I. Duplex Scanning and Treatment of Superﬁcial Truncal Reﬂux: Endorsed by the Society
for Vascular Medicine and the International Union of Phlebology. J Vasc Surg Venous Lymphat Disord 2023;11:23161) contained an error.
On page 237 of the printed article, the implementation remark 1.1.b on the deﬁnition of reﬂux erroneously contained
two sentences on management of junctional reﬂux. Management of junctional reﬂux is addressed in Part II of the
guidelines, in Consensus Statement 5.2.3.
The two sentences that need to be removed read as follows: “Complete axial reﬂux in a symptomatic patient is
pathognomonic, but junctional reﬂux alone is an indication for ablation. Conversely, a competent junction may
be associated with an incompetent, pathologic GSV distal to the terminal valve and the source of varicosity in
such patients can be either pelvic vein incompetence or an incompetent thigh perforating vein.”
