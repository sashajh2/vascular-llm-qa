 of a pulse. The type
of waveform provides important information about the characteristics of blood fow. These
waveforms can be categorized as triphasic, bisphasic, or monophasic. Clinicians use these
waveform patterns to diagnose and monitor arterial diseases, assess the severity of stenosis,
and determine the effectiveness of treatment interventions.
Pulse volume recordings (PVR) use pressure cuffs to record the shape of a pulse. The type
of waveform provides important information about the characteristics of blood fow. These
waveforms can be categorized as triphasic, bisphasic, or monophasic. Clinicians use these
waveform patterns to diagnose and monitor arterial diseases, assess the severity of stenosis,
and determine the effectiveness of treatment interventions.
 Triphasic Waveform:
 A triphasic waveform consists of three phases: forward fow during systole, a brief reverse
fow during early diastole, and a second forward fow component during late diastole.
 Clinical Significance: Triphasic waveforms are typically found in healthy, unobstructed
arteries. They represent normal arterial blood fow. These waveforms are seen in arteries serving well-perfused tissues where resistance is low, and blood fow is unimpeded.
Triphasic waveforms are commonly observed in the larger arteries of the extremities, such
as the femoral and brachial arteries.
 Biphasic Waveform:
 A biphasic waveform displays two phases: an initial forward fow during systole (when
the heart contracts and ejects blood) followed by brief reverse or “refected” fow during
early diastole.
 Clinical Significance: Biphasic waveforms are often associated with moderate arterial
stenosis. The reverse fow component indicates some degree of obstruction. They can be
observed in patients with early-stage PAD or moderate occlusions. Biphasic waveforms
suggest that some blood is able to fow past the obstruction during systole but encounters
resistance during diastole.
 Monophasic Waveform:
 A monophasic waveform consists of a single, continuous fow signal that moves in one
direction. It typically lacks a distinct reverse or “refected” fow signal.
 Clinical Significance: Monophasic waveforms are often seen in arteries downstream from
significant stenosis or occlusion. In these cases,
