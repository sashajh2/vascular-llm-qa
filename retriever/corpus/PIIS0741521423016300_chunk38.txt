In a person with diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and a foot
ulcer or gangrene, consider using the Wound/Ischaemia/foot
Infection (WIfI) classiﬁcation system to estimate healing likelihood and amputation risk.

Rationale. The Wound, Ischaemia and Foot infection
(WIfI) classiﬁcation system was developed to guide the
clinician in estimating the risk of amputation and potential beneﬁt of revascularisation in people with a
foot ulcer or gangrene, and is recommended by the
Global Vascular Guideline for limb staging (relating to
severity of limb threat) in people with chronic limb
threatening ischaemia (CLTI).20 This system was developed by an interdisciplinary panel of experts and stages
the limb based on the presence of, and severity of, the

foot wound, ischaemia, and infection. A Delphi
consensus process was used to allocate these combinations into four clinical stages based on very low (stage
1), low (stage 2), moderate (stage 3), and high (stage 4)
predicted one year risk of major amputation. Consistent
with all other commonly used limb staging systems, the
individual’s co-morbidities which are likely to inﬂuence
wound healing and amputation risk are not incorporated into WIfI. A second distinct aspect of the WIfI
system is the predicted likelihood of beneﬁt from
revascularisation.84
A recent systematic review concluded that in people
undergoing a revascularisation procedure, the likelihood of an amputation after one year increases with
higher WIfI stages. The estimated one year major amputation rates from four studies comprising 569 participants were 0%, 8% (95% CI 3 e 21%), 11% (95% CI 6 e
18%), and 38% (95% CI 21 e 58%), for WIfI clinical stages
1e4, respectively.85 For the population of people with a
DFU, the WIfI system was evaluated in the IWGDF systematic review on classiﬁcation systems, that is published in parallel to this guideline. In summary, in
people with
