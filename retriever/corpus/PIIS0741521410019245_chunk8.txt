,11 This is consistent
with the available evidence in which mortality was 46% in
those managed nonoperatively.9 While most did not favor
discharge without repair, depending on the severity of the
injury (see below), minority opinion was expressed that
expectant management was appropriate with follow-up imaging.
Issue 2: Management of “minimal aortic injury”
(periadventitial defect or hematoma). Intimal or periadventitial defects or hematomas are not infrequently seen on
computed tomography (CT) scan. A classification scheme
for grading the severity of aortic injury has been proposed:
type I (intimal tear), type II (intramural hematoma), type
III (pseudoaneurysm), and type IV (rupture)12 (Fig). The
committee suggests expectant management with serial imaging for type I injuries, while types II to IV should be
repaired. This is based on early evidence that most type I

injuries heal spontaneously.12 Decision to intervene and its
timing should be guided by progression of the initial radiographic abnormality and/or symptoms.
Issue 3: Choice of repair in the young—TEVAR vs
open. There was near unanimity of opinion that anatomic
suitability is important for TEVAR but age should not be a
factor in deciding the type of repair. The risks of death and
spinal cord ischemia are significantly lower in all age groups
after endovascular repair compared with open surgery,13-15
and these early benefits outweigh the concerns of potential
late complications. However, in surgically fit patients with
poor anatomy for endovascular repair, conventional open
repair should be considered.
Issue 4: Suitability and the unmet needs of current
FDA-approved thoracic endografts. With the availability of three commercially available devices, there was considerable divergence of opinion about the “best” device for
use in traumatic thoracic aortic injury. There was a consensus, however, that arch conformation represented the
