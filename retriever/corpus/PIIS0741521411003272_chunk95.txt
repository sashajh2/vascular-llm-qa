randomized study of RFA using the newgeneration RF catheter system.260 Paresthesia occurred in
3.2%, thrombophlebitis in 0.8%, ecchymosis along the
course of the GSV in 6.3%, and skin pigmentation in 2%.
Lawrence et al262 reported a 2.6% rate of thrombus extension into the femoral veins after 500 RF procedures. No
femoral DVT occurred. The rate of proximal thrombus
extension was significantly higher in patients with a history
of DVT and in those with a GSV diameter of ⬎8 mm (P ⬍
.02).
RFA vs high ligation, division, and stripping. Four
RCTs compared the results of RFA with those of high
ligation, division, and stripping.195,278,280-282 Rautio et
al278 from Finland reported results of a single-center randomized trial in 28 patients. Results at 3 years from the
same study were reported later by Perälä et al.283 This study
found significantly less pain with faster recovery and earlier
return to work after RFA than after surgery (6.5 days vs
15.6 days). Perioperative costs were higher for RFA ($794
vs $360), but total societal costs were lower ($1401 vs
$1926).
Lurie et al reported results of the Endovenous Radiofrequency Obliteration (Closure procedure) versus Ligation and Stripping (EVOLVeS) study at 4 months195 and at
2 years.256 This international, multicenter, prospective
study randomized 85 patients to RFA or HL/S. The RFA
group had faster recovery, less postoperative pain, fewer
adverse events, and superior QOL scores (P ⬍ .05). Clinical
and hemodynamic outcomes of RFA were comparable to
vein stripping at 2 years. The study found that at 2 years,
91.2% of limbs in the RFA group were free of superficial
reflux vs 91.7% in the surgical group (P ⫽ NS).
