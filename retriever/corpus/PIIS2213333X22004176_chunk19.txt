incompetence of the GSV or SSV; (4) incompetent perforating vein ablation vs no perforator ablation for patients
with simple varicose veins (CEAP class C2) with or without
axial incompetence of the GSV or SSV; and (5) treatment of
varicose tributaries with phlebectomy or sclerotherapy,
concomitant with, or staged after, endovenous ablation of
the incompetent GSV or SSV.
The Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center was
asked to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis
of the latest data available to address these questions.19
For the review, comprehensive searches were conducted
through December 7, 2020, using the MEDLINE, Embase,
Scopus, the National Library of Medicine (PubMed), and
the Cochrane databases. All recommendations for these
clinical practice guidelines were based on this systematic
review and meta-analysis, which have been reported
together with these guidelines.19 Additional major studies,
RCTs, and Cochrane and other systematic reviews and
meta-analyses, reported on-line or in print before submission of these guidelines, were also reviewed by the writing
committee.

GUIDELINES
Guideline 1. Diagnostic evaluation of vein
incompetence
Guideline 1.1: For patients with CVD of the lower extremities, we recommend DU scanning as the diagnostic test of choice to evaluate for venous reﬂux.
Level of recommendation: grade 1 (strong), quality of
evidence: B (moderate)
Rationale. DU is a noninvasive diagnostic test that is
safe, sensitive, speciﬁc, and cost-effective to evaluate
vein incompetence in patients with varicose veins. The
test is objective and reproducible but requires technical training and experience to perform a thorough
and accurate study. DU also requires physician expertise to correctly interpret a DU study. DU was recommended as the diagnostic test of choice for patients
with CVD in previous SVS/AVF guidelines and in a
consensus document from the International Union of
Phlebology.20,38,39 The 2016 Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Advisory Committee panel40
and an earlier systematic review,41 however, did not
ﬁnd sufﬁcient evidence to support or refute
