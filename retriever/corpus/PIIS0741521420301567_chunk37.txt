 being
able to assess the location and size of the SAA, CTA
may also reveal rupture, intra-abdominal hemorrhage,
and associated underlying diseases. In addition, nearly
all necessary data for planning endovascular treatment
can be obtained by multidimensional CTA.83 Ultrasound
examination of visceral vessels is inhibited by shadowing
from bowel gas as well as by obesity; however, its sensitivity to detect SAA <3 cm is poor.83,85 MRA may certainly
play a role in patients in whom CTA is contraindicated.
However, in 2006, Pilleul et al86 compared the use of

We recommend CTA as the initial diagnostic tool of choice for SAAs, with 1-mmthickness sections if available.

In patients with suspected SAAs and pre-existing renal insufﬁciency limiting the
use of iodinated contrast material, we recommend MRA to establish diagnosis.

We recommend using arteriography when noninvasive studies have not
sufﬁciently demonstrated the status of relevant collateral blood ﬂow and when
endovascular intervention is planned.
