rene.52 We recommend that all patients
with impending tissue loss related to venous thrombosis be
evaluated for iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction as
well as potential causes of profound hypercoagulability
such as malignancy and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Anticoagulation should be initiated according to the

Meissner et al 1455

ACCP guidelines,24 with careful attention to the possibility
of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or malignancy.61
Although the evidence is of low quality and largely
limited to case reports and series, thrombolytic therapy
does appear to limit the progression of pregangrenous
changes in patients with profound iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction. Several reports document the efficacy of
pharmacomechanical or catheter-directed pharmacologic
thrombolysis in limiting or reversing ischemic changes due
to PCD.57,62,63 Despite concerns regarding the quality of
the data, the potential benefits appear to outweigh the risks
in this life- and limb-threatening condition. The relative
infrequency of PCD with impending tissue loss, the heterogeneity of patients, and the poor results of anticoagulation
alone make it unlikely that large randomized trials will be
performed. Furthermore, the results of conventional anticoagulation are sufficiently dismal that catheter-directed
pharmacologic thrombolysis for impending venous gangrene in the presence of iliofemoral thrombosis is strongly
recommended (Grade 1A).
Although older series recommended fasciotomy for
compartment syndrome associated with PCD,15,64 its role
in contemporary management is controversial. However,
we must emphasize that fasciotomy is not first-line therapy,
should not precede rapid intervention to relieve iliofemoral
venous outflow obstruction, and should rarely be considered as an isolated procedure. A decrease in compartmental
pressures will accompany successful relief of outflow obstruction53 and usually obviates the need for fasciotomy.
We suggest that fasciotomy only be considered if compartment pressures in the thigh or calf remain elevated (â¬Ž30
mm Hg) despite efforts to restore iliofemoral venous outflow using the procedures outlined above (Grade 2C).
