 and a risk
for death of 12%/y. The investigators found a similar median survival in patients with untreated TAA of only
3.3 years. In a natural history study by Crawford and
DeNatale26 of TAA patients who were not candidates
for open surgery, the survival rate was just 24% at 2 years,
with more than half the deaths related to aneurysm
rupture. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
was noted in 80% of the subgroup with rupture. Similar
studies in patients with small infrarenal AAAs have
conﬁrmed COPD as a signiﬁcant risk factor for rupture.27
Cambria et al28 followed up a series of 57 patients with
TAA, including those who were not considered operative
candidates. The authors found that an aneurysm
>5 cm (P ¼ .05) and both COPD and chronic renal failure
were associated with rupture (P ¼ .06). Griepp et al29
studied 165 patients with TAAA who did not undergo surgery, ﬁnding that about 20% experienced aneurysm
rupture. Signiﬁcant risk factors included older age,
COPD, continued pain, and aortic diameter. Patients
with AD ruptured at smaller aortic diameters than did
those with degenerative aneurysms.
Practice Statement: More research focused on the
pathogenesis and clinical care of patients with isolated
TAA is required.22-29 (Ungraded good practice

THE THORACIC AORTA: ANATOMY AND
CLASSIFICATIONS
Anatomy of the thoracic aorta. The thoracic aorta is
divided into the aortic root, ascending aorta, aortic
arch, and descending aorta. The size of the thoracic aorta
increases from the root to the diaphragm, with an
average size between 2 and 3 cm; it is approximately
10% smaller in women.6,30 Critically at risk during
TEVAR are the multiple spinal cord branches that may
be covered by the endograft after emerging as dorsal
branches from the intercostal arteries. These critical
