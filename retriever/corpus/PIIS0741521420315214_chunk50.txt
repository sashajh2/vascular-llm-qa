 LSA, 9.1% with coverage and no revascularization, and 5.1% with LSA coverage and revascularization,
supporting routine LSA revascularization.136 The largest
systematic review and meta-analysis support these ﬁndings. A review137 published in 2017 evaluated the incidence of stroke in 2594 patients treated with TEVAR
and found the incidence in patients when the LSA was
uncovered to be 3.2% (95% CI, 1.0-6.5). When the LSA
was covered but revascularized, the stroke rate was
5.3% (95% CI, 2.6-8.6) compared with 8.0% (95% CI, 4.112.9) when the vessel was covered without revascularization. Despite these data, selective LSA revascularization
strategies are not embraced by some because of concerns for prolonging the procedure, complications of
revascularization operations, and a perception that patients at elevated risk for subclavian artery ischemia can
be identiﬁed ahead of time.138
There are two scenarios in which LSA revascularization
should always be considered to reduce perioperative
stroke, even in “selective” approaches. Most concerning
is when a nonrevascularized vertebral artery ends in the
posterior inferior cerebellar artery, which would risk
causing inadequate ﬂow through the circle of Willis
into the posterior cerebral circulation.139 In addition,
with a dominant left vertebral artery (66%-75% of patients) in the presence of an absent, atretic, or diseased
right vertebral artery, nonrevascularization of the LSA increases the risk for posterior cerebral ischemia.
Arm ischemia and vertebrobasilar insufﬁciency. Left
arm ischemia symptoms may range from none to a
frankly threatened limb. Special consideration should
be given to LSA revascularization and left arm perfusion
for patients at risk of coronary ischemia due to a prior
left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior
descending artery coronary bypass graft as well as for
those with existing arteriovenous ﬁstulas in the left arm.
