for screening is discussed elsewhere in this section.

Imaging modalities
The most important features of imaging of carotid
bifurcation disease are the degree of stenosis and the
character of the plaque.3,26,28,37,38 It is common for clinicians to use multiple modalities when evaluating and
planning intervention for patients with carotid artery stenosis. A greater degree of stenosis is generally thought to
reﬂect an increased risk of future stroke.26,37 However,
plaque morphology also plays a signiﬁcant role.38 The
morphologic features of the plaque include heterogeneity, measurement of plaque area and juxtaluminal black
area, gray-scale median, and echogenicity.
Duplex ultrasound examination. Duplex ultrasound
examination is safe, accurate, and reliable. Because results are heavily dependent on technique, it should be
performed in an accredited ultrasound laboratory
(consensus of writing group).3 Duplex ultrasound examination is the ﬁrst-line imaging modality for carotid artery
imaging, screening, and identiﬁcation of patients with
70% to 99% stenosis of the internal carotid artery
(ICA).39,40 The rationale for widespread use of duplex ultrasound examination include its low cost, ease of performance, and robust sensitivity (0.89; 95% conﬁdence
interval [CI], 0.85-0.92) and speciﬁcity (0.84; 95% CI, 0.770.89).39,41 Consensus ultrasound criteria for diagnosing
varying degrees of carotid artery stenosis have been
extensively developed, widely used and validated.42 Yet,
duplex criteria that are used to categorize degree of
stenosis can vary widely across centers, thereby impacting treatment decisions.43,44 Duplex ultrasound examination may have a lower sensitivity and speciﬁcity for
diagnosis of more moderate degrees of
