 provide symptomatic relief with long-term patency rates
>70% and relatively low DVT risk (Hwang et al. 2020a).
Patients with deep venous refux due to congenital, primary, or secondary (post-thrombotic
syndrome following DVT) valvular incompetence may be candidates for valvular reconstruction
if symptoms recur following attempted conservative and/or endovenous therapies for superficial
refux. These patients usually have class C4b to C6 disease or disabling signs and symptoms
such as severe edema (C3) (Sidawy and Perler 2023e). Treatment options focus on either
correcting the anatomical defect of the incompetent valve via internal valvuloplasty/external
valvuloplasty, or by replacing the architecture via valve transposition or vein transplantation
(Maleti and Perrin 2011a). Most recently, promising results from the SAVVE trial studying
the use of a novel synthetic neovalve (VenoValve) represent an additional treatment modality
for chronic venous insuï¬€ciency.

Outcomes & Surveillance
Compression Therapy vs. Surgical Intervention
 For patients with severe varicose veins (C2), surgical treatment (HL&S, phlebectomy)
was associated with significant improvements to QoL, symptom relief, and patient satisfaction as compared to conservative treatment (lifestyle modification, leg elevation,
and/or compression stockings) (Michaels et al. 2006a).
 In a randomized trial comparing compression to surgical stripping of the GSV in patients
with C2-C3 venous disease, VCSS decreased from 4.6 to 3.5 in the compression group (P
<0.01) and from 4.8 to 0.6 in the surgery group (P <0.001) (Sell et al. 2014a). Therefore,
the Society for Vascular Surgery recommends against a three-month trial of conservative
therapy prior to intervention for patients with C2 and C3 disease (Gloviczki et al. 2024a).
 In the landmark ESCHAR trial, patients with C5-C
