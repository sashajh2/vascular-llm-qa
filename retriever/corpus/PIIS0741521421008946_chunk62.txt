 to 0.47%]; RR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.37 to1.39]; P ¼
.32).207 A more recent study propensity scored patients
from the VQI that had undergone either TCAR or CEA were
compared. Of this cohort 9435 were asymptomatic. There
was no difference in stroke and death between CEA and
TCAR (1.3% vs 1.4%; P ¼ .49), although TCAR was associated
with a lower incidence of MI and CNI, as well as a shorter
length of stay.208
Summary and recommendations
1. For neurologically symptomatic patients with stenosis
less than 50% or asymptomatic patients with stenosis
less than 60% diameter reduction, optimal medical
therapy is indicated. There are no data to support
transfemoral CAS, TCAR, or CEA in this patient group.
