-2.06). Varenicline (Chantix) was also
superior to placebo in achieving quitting (OR, 2.88; 95%
CI, 2.40-3.47). Bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy were found to be equally efﬁcacious. Conversely, varenicline was superior to single forms of nicotine
replacement therapy (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.29-1.91), but was
not superior to combination nicotine replacement therapy (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.75-1.48). Nortriptyline was also
effective in increasing smoking cessation (RR 1.26; 95%
CI, 0.62-2.56).111
Antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy
Although there is no compelling evidence to support a
beneﬁt of aspirin among patients with asymptomatic carotid artery disease, the US Preventive Services Task Force
recommends initiating low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults aged 50 to
59 years who have a 10-year risk of greater than 10% for
cardiovascular disease, have a life expectancy 10 years
or more, and are not at increased risk of bleeding. For individuals aged 60 to 69 years, the decision should be
individualized. There is insufﬁcient evidence to support
aspirin recommendations for individuals less than
50 years of age.112
Aspirin studies focusing on individuals with asymptomatic
carotid stenoses also show conﬂicting results. In the Asymptomatic Cervical Bruit study, 372 patients with asymptomatic stenosis greater than 50% internal carotid stenoses
were randomized to daily aspirin (325 mg) or placebo. At a
median follow-up of 2.3 years, there was no signiﬁcant differences between groups in incidence of any ischemic event or
death.113 Conversely, in the Asymptomatic Carotid Emboli
Study that focused on patients with a 70-99% asymptomatic st
