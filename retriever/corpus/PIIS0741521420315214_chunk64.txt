 and a sheath size <20F (94.2% <20F vs 88.7%

been associated with improved success with a percutaneous approach include a >1-cm segment of mid common femoral artery without anterior calciﬁcation,

absence of severe scarring in the groin, native arterial access (as opposed to access in graft material), and access
vessel diameter >5 mm.182,184,186,187 Percutaneous
femoral access has a safety proﬁle that is comparable
to that of open femoral access in anatomically appropriate patients, and both approaches are appropriate
for TEVAR, even in the obese.188
Recommendation 30: If an open approach for access is
used, we recommend transverse or oblique incisions in
performing open femoral access for TEVAR. Level of
recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 31: We recommend using ultrasound guidance for percutaneous access to improve procedural success and to decrease the rate of major
complications. Level of recommendation: Grade 1
(Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 32: We recommend that percutaneous access for TEVAR is safe and an acceptable alternative to open common femoral artery exposure if
certain anatomic criteria are met (eg, diameter of common femoral artery, lack of front wall calcium). Level of
recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Iliac or aortic access. Multiple industry-sponsored trials
of TEVAR have shown that the sizes of the common and
external iliac arteries remain a barrier to device delivery in
some patients. Atherosclerotic occlusive disease can be
treated with balloon angioplasty or use of the Dotter
technique with serially larger balloons and dilators to
facilitate transfemoral delivery of a device, but it should
be performed carefully with low-pressure inﬂations
starting with a small balloon to avoid iliac rupture.
