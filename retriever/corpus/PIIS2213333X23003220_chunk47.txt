or higher, those treated with compression had less pain
within the ﬁrst 10 days postoperatively, and earlier return
to daily activities.13 No differences were noted in bruising
score, VCSS, QOL, complications, or vein occlusion rate. A
subgroup analysis of a meta-analysis, encompassing 1147
patients, suggested that the greatest beneﬁts in pain
reduction were in patients undergoing endovenous laser
ablation (EVLA), with no beneﬁt seen after RFA.26 This
ﬁnding is consistent with other studies demonstrating
greater pain with EVLA compared with RFA.95,96 An RCT
by Bootun et al97 demonstrated a clear beneﬁt of
compression leading to signiﬁcantly better pain scores
for the ﬁrst 5 days after endothermal ablation of saphenous veins. Compression was effective in reducing early
pain also in patients who underwent concurrent phlebectomies (Table V).
The duration of therapy has been studied in the
context of short-term (24-48 hours), mid-term (12 weeks), and long-term (3-6 weeks) therapy. A metaanalysis of 775 patients undergoing endothermal ablation found a difference in postoperative pain at 1 week
but not at later time points in patients undergoing 12 weeks of compression compared with those with
24 to 48 hours.99 Long-term therapy has been shown
to have equivalent outcomes to midterm therapy.98
Therefore, application of compression for 1 week after
any endothermal treatment, especially those with concurrent phlebectomy may be useful for pain reduction.
In the recently published multicenter society guidelines, a compression dressing of >20 mm Hg (corresponding with class II compression stocking pressure)
with eccentric pads over the ablation point is recommended for patients undergoing vein ablation for
greatest reduction in postoperative pain.100

3. Drugs and nutritional supplements
3.1. In symptomatic patients with varicose veins, who
are not candidates for intervention, who are waiting
for intervention or have symptoms after intervention,
we suggest micronized puriﬁed ﬂavonoid fraction
(MPFF) or Ruscus extracts for treatment of vein related
pain, leg heav
