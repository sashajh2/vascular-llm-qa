 over traditional surgeries due to lower morbidity and quicker recovery times.
9. Surgical interventions significantly improve quality of life and symptom relief compared to conservative therapies for severe CVD.
10. Long-term surveillance with duplex ultrasound is essential to monitor disease progression and recurrence post-treatment, with early intervention shown to accelerate
ulcer healing and reduce recurrence rates.

Pre/Post Questions
Case Based Questions
1. A 55-year-old male presents with aching legs, swelling, and skin discoloration. Physical
examination reveals dilated veins and hyperpigmentation. Which diagnostic modality is
most appropriate initially?
A. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
B. Venous duplex ultrasound
C. Arterial Doppler ultrasound
D. Computed tomography (CT) scan

Answer
B. Venous duplex ultrasound
Discussion: Venous duplex ultrasound is the initial diagnostic study of choice for evaluating chronic venous disease. It helps detect venous obstruction or refux, which are
critical in diagnosing and planning management for patients with symptoms like aching
legs, swelling, and skin changes indicative of venous insuﬀciency. MRI, arterial Doppler
ultrasound, and CT scan are not typically used as initial diagnostic tests for chronic
venous disease.
2. A 40-year-old female presents with varicose veins that are causing discomfort. She has no
skin changes or ulcers. What is the most appropriate initial treatment for her condition?
A. Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA)
B. Sclerotherapy
C. Conservative therapy with
