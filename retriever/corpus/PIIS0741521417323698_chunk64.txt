 had been
missed.256 A signiﬁcant portion of patients present with
rupture despite known AAA status.256 In an analysis of a
cohort of >3 million individuals, it was suggested that
small changes in recommended eligibility requirements,
such as accounting for the impact of accumulated cardiovascular risk factors, would improve the screening
yield for women, nonsmokers, and other groups traditionally considered at lower risk.33
Effective use of the electronic health record to improve
screening of target populations has been demonstrated
by Kaiser Permanente of Southern California.257 “Best
practice alerts” for AAA screening criteria were integrated
into the electronic health record and reduced the percentage of unscreened patients within their 3.6 million
subscriber system from 52% to 20% within 15 months.
These alerts were directed to nursing staff when patients
checked in for any visit with any provider. Automatic
screening orders were then entered that clinicians would
sign when visit-speciﬁc relevant orders were completed.
Patients who had undergone any type of crosssectional abdominal imaging in the preceding 10 years
(>54,000) were excluded from the alert system.257
In addition to the United States, governmentsponsored screening programs have been implemented
in the United Kingdom and Sweden, and the results
reﬂect the changing epidemiology of aneurysmal disease. In Sweden, the screening yield was less than half
that expected, despite widespread participation.258 Similarly, in the ﬁrst 3 years of the U.K. National Health Service
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Program, AAA
detection rate was only 1.6%, less than 50% of that expected on the basis of the results of the prior MASS
cohort.259 However, cost-effectiveness calculations
derived from MASS (£7600/life-year gained) suggest
that AAA screening in England and other European
countries will remain cost-effective even with prevalence
rates as low as 1%.260-262
Other challenges to efﬁcient implementation of
screening include the identiﬁcation and exclusion of patients who have had prior abdominal cross-sectional imaging studies, accounting for increasing longevity,
potential needs for late rescreening,263 and selective
screening to optimize
