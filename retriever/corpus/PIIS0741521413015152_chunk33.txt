IfI 221. The clinical stage would be 4
(high risk of amputation); the anticipated beneﬁt of
revascularization is also high.
Example 3. A 44-year-old woman without a previous
diagnosis of diabetes presents to the emergency room with
systemic sepsis, a fever of 39.5 C, an elevated white blood
cell count of 26,000, and serum blood glucose of 600. She
has a 6-cm full thickness wound on the plantar aspect of the
forefoot with crepitus. The dorsalis pedis pulse is palpable,
and the ABI is 1.08. She would be classiﬁed as follows: W2
I0 fI 3 or WIfI 203. The clinical stage is 4 (high risk of
amputation), but the anticipated beneﬁt of revascularization is low.
In this exercise we also emphasize that clinicians should
reclassify the limb at the time of planned revascularization,

since control of sepsis or prior foot debridement may have
altered the WIfI classiﬁcation from the time of initial presentation. The reclassiﬁcation process after surgical debridement can be simpliﬁed (Table V). It is important to note
that this process is quite similar to the restaging that occurs
during and after evaluation and treatment for cancer. Thus,
a small superﬁcial wound (W 1) could be reclassiﬁed as a W
2 or W 3 after surgical debridement, but before revascularization is attempted. Two patient scenarios in Table V illustrate this process. Supplementary Fig 2 (online only)
provides clinical examples of wound grades.
SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS
The SVS WIfI classiﬁcation system is a ﬁrst critical step
toward re-examining the evaluation and treatment of
patients with a spectrum of lower extremity arterial disease.
It is intended to be an iterative process with the goal of
more precisely stratifying patients according to their initial
disease burden, analogous to TNM cancer staging, but not
to dictate therapy.
One important potential application of this system is
for improved clinical trials design. Appropriate stratiﬁcation
