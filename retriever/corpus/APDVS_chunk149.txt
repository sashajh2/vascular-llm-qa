 IN): fexible wire with a hydrophobic coating and curved tip. Used to access vessels that have a slight curve, or to introduce
catheters or sheaths. Comes in 0.035” diameter and 150 cm or 260 cm in length.
 Rosen (Cook medical, Bloomington, IN): stiff hydrophobic wire with J tip. Often
used as the first wire exchanged for the access wire. 0.035” long and 80 cm to 260 cm in
length.
High stiffness rail wires:
 Amplatz (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA): stiff, hydrophobic, straight
foppy or J-tip. 0.035” - 0.038” diameter and 75 cm - 260 cm in length.

189

 Lunderquist (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN): one of the stiffest wires, hydrophobic, with foppy or curved tip. 0.035” diameter and 90 cm - 300 cm in length. Often
used to advance large endografts.

Catheters
Catheters are fexible, hollow tubes that are used in both the diagnosis and treatment of
vascular disease.
Ĺ Note
Catheters are measured in French (1F = 0.33 mm) and the diameter corresponds to the
outer diameter of the tube.

Figure 3: Outer diameter = OD, Inner diameter = ID.
Catheters vary by size, stiffness, hydrophilicity, radiopacity, and functionality, but can generally be described in two categories, fush catheters and selective catheters.
Flush catheters:
 Contain multiple side holes just proximal to the end of the device to allow for the injection
of contrast or other material, such as thrombolytics.
 Omnifush (Angiodynamics, Latham, NY): soft, fexible catheter with a radiopaque
tip that is able to administer contrast to visualize vessels. Omnifush device on back table
 Pigtail (Angiodynamics, Latham, NY): Similar to the Omnifush with a looped
end (Image YY).

Selective catheters:
 Contain one hole at the distal end of the tube.
 Selective catheters come in many different shapes
