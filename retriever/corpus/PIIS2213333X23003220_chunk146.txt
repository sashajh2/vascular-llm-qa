CI, 0.06-0.18%).236 Other systematic reviews have found
the majority of DVTs to be conﬁned to the calf veins,
with the incidence of proximal DVT varying between
0% and 0.4%.41

How substantial are desirable effects of
the strategy?
How substantial are the undesirable
anticipated effects?

Evidence/Panel input
Routine thromboprophylaxis appears to reduce the risk of
postprocedural thrombotic events, but the data is heterogenous and
the magnitude of effect is low.
Low risk of increased bleeding with pharmacoprophylaxis.
No data regarding the cost and inconvenience of pharmacoprophylaxis.

Judgment
Low

Probably
low

Do the desirable effects outweigh the
undesirable effects?

Probably, but with very low magnitude of effect.

evidence of effects?

Low with signiﬁcant heterogeneity and low magnitude of effect

Judgment

How substantial are desirable effects of the
strategy?

The value of routine treatment of symptomatic DVT is well
established although it is less certain that the natural history of
ARTE is identical to DVT.

Probably

How substantial are the undesirable
anticipated effects?
