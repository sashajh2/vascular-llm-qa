 penetrating or blunt liver trauma, leading to symptomatic
presentation of these aneurysms. These antecedent
clinical events along with speciﬁc imaging distinguish
false aneurysms from true aneurysms. Imaging ﬁndings,
which include focal arterial disruption in the setting of
otherwise normal arteries and inﬂammatory changes
around an irregular aneurysm sac, are reported.1 The
majority of pseudoaneurysms are symptomatic at presentation, thereby differing from true aneurysms, with
gastrointestinal bleeding or hemobilia.1,148
True HAA. The true natural history of HAA is unknown
because of the rarity of these aneurysms, making any
recommendation for repair of asymptomatic HAA
controversial. In the series published by the Mayo Clinic,
these aneurysms appeared to be relatively benign with
a slow rate of enlargement and relatively uncommon
rate of rupture.150 Retrospective series of ruptured

low rate of comorbidities in the presence of
collaterals.151,152
There is an association between HAA and the patients
with ﬁbromuscular dysplasia, vasculitis, systemic lupus
erythematosus or polyarteritis nodosa, Takayasu arteritis, and Wegener granulomatosis.153-158 Congenital
causes of HAA, such as Marfan syndrome, EhlersDanlos syndrome, and Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome,
are reported.159 Patients with ﬁbromuscular dysplasia
and polyarteritis nodosa are at signiﬁcant risk of HAA
rupture, accounting for 50% of ruptured HAA in one
series.150 Bacterial endocarditis was the main cause of
HAA before the adequate treatment of endocarditis
with antibiotics was widespread.153 Aneurysm rupture
is reported with a wide range of 14%150 to 80%,159
but given the retrospective nature of these studies,
the true risk of rupture is unknown. Nonatherosclerotic
aneurysms, however, are at signiﬁcantly higher risk of
rupture as they often present as
