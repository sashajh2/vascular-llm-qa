femoral or iliac access is not available. However,
more data are required to determine whether carotidaxillary artery access for delivery of a thoracic endograft

Recommendations for treatment of symptomatic and
ruptured TAAs
Early mortality after open repair of ruptured DTA is high
as evidenced by a Swedish study from the preendovascular era that reported an in-hospital mortality
approaching 100%.199 The results with TEVAR have
been much more promising. A multicenter trial of acute
aortic catastrophes showed a mortality of 15% in the
ruptured arm.200 This compared favorably with the results of open repair from the National Inpatient Sample
database, which had an early mortality of 45%.201 Indeed,
a review of the Medicare database from 2004 to 2007
showed that the percentage of ruptured DTA patients
who were treated with TEVAR increased from 17% in
2004 to 49% in 2007 (a total of 1033 patients treated),

with a signiÔ¨Åcant decrease in mortality from 45% in
open repair to 24% with TEVAR (P < .001).202 It is likely
that there is an early survival advantage to treating
ruptured DTA with TEVAR over open repair.
There appear to be advantages to TEVAR over open
repair of the DTA beyond survival. A meta-analysis
comparing 224 patients from 28 articles showed a significantly lower incidence of perioperative myocardial
infarction (11% vs 3.1%; P < .05) compared with open
repair.203 In addition, a comparison of 161 patients from
7 hospitals during a 15-year period showed a lower incidence of the composite end point of stroke, paraplegia,
and death in the TEVAR cohort compared with open
repair (36.2% vs 21.7%; P < .05), but no difference was
seen in the individual outcomes because of small
numbers.204 Long-term outcomes have been reasonable
after TEVAR for ruptured DTA. A review
