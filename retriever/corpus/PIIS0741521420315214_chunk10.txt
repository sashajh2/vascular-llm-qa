Prior infrarenal aortic operation or endovascular aneurysm repair with previously ligated or covered lumbar
and middle sacral arteries
Planned extensive coverage ($15 cm) of the DTA
Hypogastric artery occlusion or signiﬁcant occlusive
disease
Presence of aneurysm disease in the young patient, for
whom future therapy involving the distal thoracic aorta
may be necessary
Recommendation 21: For patients with acute thoracic
emergencies, where TEVAR is required urgently and
coverage of the LSA is necessary, it is suggested that
revascularization
should
be
individualized
and
addressed on the basis of the patient’s anatomy and urgency of the procedure. Level of recommendation:
Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 22: We recommend preprocedural
TEVAR planning to include sizing and landing sites
before the case to minimize procedural contrast material
use. If available, intraoperative CTA overlay technology
and intravascular ultrasound should be used to minimize
use of contrast material. Level of recommendation:
Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 23: We recommend nonionic,
hypo-osmolar contrast material with attempts at minimizing intra-arterial contrast agent use, especially in patients at high risk for contrast-induced nephropathy.
Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of
Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 24: Depending on the patient’s
corporal density and the capacity of the X-ray equipment available, we suggest diluting contrast material
in the power injector when possible (typically to 50%
or 70%). Adjustments in injection volume and time
(faster injection of smaller doses) can usually compensate when additional visibility is required. Level of
recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low)
Recommendation 25: We suggest the use of on-table
mapping software options on ﬁxed-imaging X-ray
systems, such as roadmapping and computed tomography
