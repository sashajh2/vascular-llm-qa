guidelines for follow-up after arterial procedures.166
DUS examination is the ideal initial imaging study for
the detection of recurrent stenoses and the recommended surveillance imaging study for the de novo lesions.
However, the velocity criteria for the native mesenteric
vessel tend to overestimate the degree of stenosis in
the treated vessels after both endovascular and open
revascularization. Several studies have documented the
velocity criteria for recurrent stenoses after revascularization and there seems to be relatively broad range of
criteria that corresponded to with a more than 70%

stenosis.167-169 Ideally, these criteria should be validated
in each individual vascular laboratory although this is
likely impractical. Simplistically, a PSV of more than
300 cm/s with an EDV of more than 50 cm/s at an angioplasty site or bypass anastomosis or a dampened velocity
spectra and a PSV of less than 40 cm/s within a bypass
graft are all suggestive of a greater than 70%
stenosis.167,168
CTA is the deﬁnitive imaging study for recurrent stenosis and can be helpful to conﬁrm/refute the DUS ﬁndings and to help plan any further intervention.170
Furthermore, it can be helpful as a surveillance imaging
study for the few patients who cannot be adequately
imaged with DUS imaging. The presence of an intraluminal stent can confound the determination of the degree of stenosis on CT scans, similar to the scenario with
DUS imaging. Noncontrast images can be helpful to
interrogate the stent architecture. A catheter-based
arteriogram with the measurement of intraluminal
pressures may occasionally be helpful in equivocal cases
to determine the hemodynamic signiﬁcance of a recurrent stenosis.77
The management of patients with a recurrent stenosis
and recurrent symptoms consistent with CMI is similar
to the management of a symptomatic de novo lesion.
Patients should undergo a CTA to facilitate the intervention, if not already performed. An endovascular-ﬁrst
approach is recommended for both failing endovascular
and open revascularization with the speciﬁcs of the procedure
