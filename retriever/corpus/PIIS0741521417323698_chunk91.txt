A type II endoleak is not treated at the time of implantation. A type III endoleak is treated by angioplasty of
component overlap sites or by placement of an additional conduit.380 A type IV endoleak is self-limited, and
treatment is not required.
Access site complications. Early experience with EVAR
using open femoral artery exposure was associated with
a high rate of access site-related complications (13%).
These included arterial dissection or perforation (1.4%);
bleeding, hematoma, or false aneurysm (6.6%); arterial
thrombosis (2.2%); embolization (1.1%); wound infection,
skin necrosis, or lymphocele (1.4%); and amputation
(0.1%).381 In a multicenter randomized controlled trial,
percutaneous access was superior to open femoral artery
access with a shorter procedure time (107 vs 141 minutes;
P ¼ .004) and fewer access complications (6% vs 10%;
P ¼ .005), with a 96% technical success rate.314 A systematic review and a recent National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program (NSQIP) review also demonstrated a high technical success rate, shorter operative

time (135 vs 152 minutes), shorter length of stay (1 vs 2
days), and fewer wound complications (1% vs 2.1%; P ¼
.02).382-385 Percutaneous access may not be appropriate
for patients with small vessels, for patients with a high
femoral artery bifurcation, or in the presence of calciﬁcation or a femoral aneurysm. In addition, a history of
prior groin surgery with or without a vascular graft or
patch and obesity may reduce success rates.386-390
Percutaneous access with large sheaths is improved by
ultrasound guidance.386,391-393
Acute limb thrombosis. Early graft limb thrombosis
