3-year occlusion rate after
CAC treatment was 94.7% (95% CI, 87.9%-100%) in a prospective study by Almeida et al.90 An allergic reaction to
cyanoacrylate is rare but has been reported,194 and those

with previous hypersensitivity reactions to cyanoacrylates
and patients with acute superﬁcial thrombophlebitis or
sepsis should not be treated with CAC.
The 5-year extension study of the VeClose (VenaSeal
Sapheon Closure System Pivotal Study) trial was recently
reported by Morrison et al.12 Freedom from recanalization at 5 years in the randomized CAC and RFA groups
was 91.4% and 85.2%, respectively, demonstrating the
noninferiority of CAC compared with RFA. Both groups
showed sustained improvement in the QoL scores.
The MOCA procedure was also evaluated in several
comparative studies, and results #3 years have been
reported.95,96,171,174,175,191 In a RCT, Bootun et al171
compared the intraprocedural pain scores for 60 patients who had undergone mechanicochemical ablation
(ClariVein) with those of 59 patients who had undergone
RFA (Covidien Veneﬁt; Medtronic).171 Both maximum and
mean pain scores were signiﬁcantly lower in the
mechanicochemical ablation group compared with the
RFA group (19.3 mm vs 34.5 mm; P < .001; 13.4 mm vs
24.4 mm; P < .001). In the MARADONA (mechanochemical endovenous ablation to radiofrequency ablation in
the treatment of primary great saphenous vein incompetence) RCT, with 213 randomized patients, mechanochemical ablation resulted in less postoperative pain
but more hyperpigmentation compared with RFA.174
More anatomic failures had been reported after the
MOCA procedure than after RFA; however, the patients
in both groups had had similar Qo
