Japan.6,7 Nevertheless, rates of autogenous AV access
within the United States have improved in the last several
years. This important progress likely reflects the effect of
national efforts to increase autogenous access placement,
such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS)–sponsored AV Fistula First Breakthrough Initiative
(FFBI) and the National Kidney Foundation (NKF)-Kidney
Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines,8,9 as well as improved preoperative evaluation, vessel mapping, and accepted priority for autogenous
access. The development of alternative and innovative approaches to autogenous AV access construction has also
contributed to wider utilization of autogenous access in
this country.10
Ten years ago, in October 1997, the NKF-KDOQI
Clinical Practice Guidelines for Vascular Access were published in an effort to increase the placement of autogenous
AV access and to prolong the use of existing access by
detection of, and timely intervention for, dysfunction.
These original guidelines and subsequent versions stress
proactive identification of patients with progressive kidney
disease, identification and protection of potential native
access construction sites by members of the health care
team and patients, and the development of a multifaceted
quality assurance program to detect at-risk vascular access,
track complication rates, and implement procedures that
maximize access longevity.

The original guidelines recommended that autogenous
AV access be constructed in at least 50
