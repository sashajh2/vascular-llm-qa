minimized to achieve appropriate CEA efﬁcacy in stroke
prevention, particularly among neurologically asymptomatic patients. More than 20 different mechanisms
of perioperative stroke have been identiﬁed.417 The
most common mechanism of stroke is perioperative
arterial thrombosis and embolization, frequently related
to a technical deﬁcit at the endarterectomy site.417,418
Examples of technical deﬁcits can include inadvertently
leaving behind residual intimal ﬂaps, atheromatous disease, or luminal thrombus.417,418 Additional examples of
technical complications include vascular clamp injuries
or damage caused by intra-arterial shunt placement.
Other potential causes of perioperative stoke include
cerebral ischemia during carotid clamping and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH),417,418 but these less common
etiologies of perioperative stroke are not typically
dependent on technical imperfections that may occur
during the operation itself.
Some authors have recommended intraoperative
completion imaging studies to minimize risk of leaving
technical imperfections at the endarterectomy site.3,417
These completion studies can include continuous wave
Doppler, duplex ultrasound examinaton, or intraoperative arteriography, and they are operator and technique
dependent. There is controversy concerning what technical deﬁcits noted on completion imaging studies warrant intraoperative reexploration of the artery because
not all technical imperfections will cause strokes.3,417
Additionally, attempts to revise lesions have the potential

to cause additional morbidity from repeated manipulation of the vessel. Some authors believe that intraoperative completion studies may be particularly useful
following eversion endarterectomy, because the distal
end point may not be sufﬁciently visualized with this
technique. Other authors have found no signiﬁcant
beneﬁt to completion imaging, and report excellent results without routinely using any type of completion
studies.3,341,417 Therefore, the routine use of completion
imaging after CEA remains controversial. The clinical signiﬁcance of many observed abnormalities is uncertain,
and it has not
