al to the common femoral vein.
The pelvic veins include the external, internal, and
common iliac veins, which drain into the inferior vena cava
(IVC). Large gonadal veins drain into the IVC on the right
and the left renal vein on the left.
Perforating veins
Perforating veins connect the superficial to the deep
venous system (Fig 1). They pass through the deep fascia
that separates the superficial compartment from the deep.
Communicating veins connect veins within the same system. The most important leg perforating veins are the
medial calf perforators.66 The posterior tibial perforating
veins (Cockett perforators in the old nomenclature) con-

nect the posterior accessory GSV of the calf (the posterior
arch vein in the old nomenclature) with the posterior tibial
veins and form the lower, middle, and upper groups. They
are located just behind the medial malleolus (lower), at 7 to
9 cm (middle) and at 10 to 12 cm (upper) from the lower
edge of the malleolus. The distance between these perforators and the medial edge of the tibia is 2 to 4 cm.66 (Fig 1).
Paratibial perforators connect the main GSV trunk with
the posterior tibial veins. In the distal thigh, perforators
of the femoral canal usually connect directly the GSV to
the femoral vein.
Venous valves
Bicuspid venous valves are important structures assisting unidirectional flow in the normal venous system. The
GSV usually has at least 6 valves (range, 4-25), with a
constant valve present within 2 to 3 cm of the SFJ in 85% of
cases,67 and the SSV has a median of 7 to 10 valves (range,
4-13).68 There are valves in the
