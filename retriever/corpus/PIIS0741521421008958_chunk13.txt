was nonsigniﬁcantly higher in patients who had CEA in
less than 2 days vs those who had CEA in 2 to 5 days (RR,
1.80; 95% CI, 0.74-4.39; Supplementary Table I, online
only) and it was statistically signiﬁcantly higher in patients with less than 2 days vs more than 6 days (RR, 4.16;
95% CI, 1.62-10.67; Supplementary Table I, online only).
Similarly, Avgerinos et al25 showed that death was
nonsigniﬁcantly higher in patients who had CEA in less
than 2 days vs more than 6 days (RR, 2.97; 95% CI, 0.2732.48; Supplementary Table I, online only). Other registry/
Vascular Quality Initiative data have shown good results
with CEA performed in the ﬁrst week, but not within the
ﬁrst 48 hours.31,109-111 Multivariate analysis of Vascular
Quality Initiative data demonstrated that when performing CEA between 3 and 7 days after a stroke, compared
with ﬁrst 48 hours after a stroke, was protective for postoperative complication (P ¼ .028) and postoperative
stroke/death (P ¼ .003). No signiﬁcant differences were
noted for CAS outcomes when performed less than 2 days
vs between 2 and 14 days. Other outcomes and outcomes
related to other time points are available in
