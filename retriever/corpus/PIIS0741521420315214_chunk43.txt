Practice Statement: In the absence of clear and widely
accepted parameters, the decision to intervene in
asymptomatic patients with IMH and PAUs should be
individualized. Asymptomatic patients treated for PAUs
in the setting of a maximal aortic diameter <5.5 cm or
with PAUs <10 mm deep or <20 mm in diameter need
further study. (Ungraded good practice statement)
TEVAR for infected TAAs. Whereas the use of TEVAR
to treat infected aortic diseases has often been reported
in single or small case series, there are no convincing
long-term data to fully support it as a deﬁnitive therapy. Although TEVAR can be effective when it is used to
temporize ruptured infected TAA or life-threatening
ﬁstula with a hollow organ (ie, aortoesophageal and
aortobronchial ﬁstulas), patients with this clinical presentation have high morbidity and mortality regardless
of the subsequent management strategy.100-103 TEVAR
may offer a more durable repair if the endograft is
pretreated with antibiotics, such as rifampin, but
there are limited data in widely disparate clinical
scenarios.100,104,105
Recommendation 16: We suggest TEVAR for symptomatic mycotic/infected TAAs as a temporizing measure,
but data demonstrating long-term beneﬁt are lacking.

Choice of anesthetic and monitoring techniques
Anesthesia. It is technically feasible to perform TEVAR
procedures percutaneously under monitored anesthesia
care with local anesthesia.106 Among other beneﬁts of
avoiding general anesthesia, local anesthesia may

theoretically allow neurologic evaluation of the patient’s
lower extremities.107
Arterial lines, large-bore venous access, and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) drains are placed before TEVAR. The necessity for each of these depends on the complexity of
the repair, the risk of spinal cord ischemia, the planned
duration of the procedure, and the likelihood of signiﬁcant blood loss. Other adjunctive techniques performed
during TEVAR, such as somatosensory
