one technique is superior to others for veins close to
the skin.
Evidence. There is no scientiﬁc evidence that supports
one type of ablation technique over another, based on
depth of vein below the skin. The risk of skin burns appears to be high in limbs with the vein
located <0.5 cm from the skin despite using subdermal
tumescent anesthesia. Pigmentation has also been
observed in these patients. In a systematic review and
network analysis that included 51 studies on EVLA, RFA,
n-butyl cyanoacrylate ablation or FS, Gasior et al156 did
not report on skin burn as a complication. In the 16
studies that Alozai et al29 included in their systematic
review/meta-analysis of treatment modalities of the
AAGSV, there was a 0.7% incidence of paresthesia with
no instances of skin burn. The ablation modalities
included RFA, EVLA, n-butyl cyanoacrylate and sclerotherapy.29 The MARADONA trial, a multicenter randomized study that compared MOCA to RFA, did not ﬁnd a
signiﬁcant difference in the incidence of skin burn or
saphenous neuralgia between the two techniques at
30 days.157
