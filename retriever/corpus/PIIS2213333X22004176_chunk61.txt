Biemans
et al,133 2013

240 Patients with
varicose veins
(GSV; C2-C5)

EVLA (n ¼ 78);
HL&S (n ¼ 68)

UGFS with
physiciancompounded
foam (n ¼ 77)

At 1 year, EVLA was
superior to UGFS in
GSV closure (P < .001);
no differences in QoL

RCT

Lattimer et al,177
2013

100 Patients with
varicose veins
(GSV; C2-C6)

EVLA (n ¼ 50)

UGFS with
physiciancompounded
foam (n ¼ 50)

Costs and
postprocedure pain
were signiﬁcantly less
and treatment
duration and time to
recovery signiﬁcantly
shorter after UGFS;
after UGFS, 56%
required additional
treatment vs 6% with
EVLA
