 therapy is associated
with significant reductions in the risks of the postthrombotic syndrome (relative risk [RR], 0.19; 95% CI .07.48), venous reflux (RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.09-0.53), and
venous obstruction (RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.34).19
These results are consistent with a previous systematic
review,20 which included less efficient systemic and locoregional techniques, demonstrating a significant reduction in postthrombotic syndrome (RR, 0.66; 95% CI,
0.47-0.94) with thrombolytic treatment. According to
this review, one case of postthrombotic syndrome would
be prevented for every five patients treated with thrombolytic therapy. The short-term hemodynamic results of
one additional randomized clinical trial in which catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis was compared
with standard anticoagulation has been published since
the most recent systematic review.50 Among 103 randomized patients, 6-month patency was significantly better
in those who received catheter-directed pharmacologic
thrombolysis (64.0% vs 35.8%; P ⫽ .004), whereas the
incidence of femoral vein reflux was similar (60.0% vs
66.0%; P ⫽ .53).
Contraindications to thrombolytic therapy include active internal bleeding; recent cerebrovascular accident or
intracranial surgery, trauma, or tumor; recent serious gastrointestinal bleeding; major trauma or surgery ⱕ10 days;
severe uncontrolled hypertension; pregnancy; endocarditis;
intracardiac thrombus; known right-to-left shunt; coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, or absolute contraindications
to anticoagulation; suspected septic thrombus; and allergy
