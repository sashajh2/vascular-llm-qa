 11%). The 3-year primary patency rates were higher
in the open group (91% vs 74%; P ¼ .18), although the survival was lower (78% vs 95%; P ¼ .003). These ﬁndings are
underscored by the fact that there has been a shift in the
patient cohort undergoing open revascularization since
the introduction of the endovascular therapies, reﬂected
by the presence of more extensive MAOD and more
advanced comorbidities.76
The results of the meta-analyses are largely consistent
with the statewide and national observations.
Indes et al115 examined the outcome of patients undergoing revascularization for CMI (n ¼ 666; open, 280;
endovascular, 347) in the state of New York from 2000
