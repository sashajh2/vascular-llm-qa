evaluation.331,332 Several ablation techniques remain under investigation, including steam ablation and pharmacomechanical and cyanoacrylate ablation as well as CHIVA
(ambulatory conservative hemodynamic management of
varicose veins; one small RCT showed that CHIVA had
a higher proportion of ulcers heal than with compression
alone) and ASVAL (ambulatory selective varicose vein
ablation under local anesthesia).20,257,333-338

Guideline 6.3: Superﬁcial Venous Reﬂux and
Healed Venous Leg Ulcer
In a patient with a healed venous leg ulcer (C5) and
incompetent superﬁcial veins that have axial reﬂux
directed to the bed of the ulcer, we recommend ablation of the incompetent veins in addition
