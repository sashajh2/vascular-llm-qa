 There were 868
C2 and C3 patients. The authors found that out of 1031
patients initially treated for GSV reﬂux, only 11.8%
required a second UGFS for recurrent reﬂux. Of the 139
patients with AAGSV reﬂux, 10.1% required a second
UGFS for recurrent reﬂux. Of the 239 patients with SSV
reﬂux, 10.5% required retreatment for axial vein reﬂux.
New reﬂux rates found in follow-up included 3.4% GSV,
6.5% AASV, and 3.4% SSV.
Hernando et al217 treated 21 patients 16 with C2 disease,
for recurrent symptomatic varicose veins. Previous interventions included CHIVA, mechanochemical ablation,
thermal ablation, and cyanoacrylate closure. The patients
were treated with catheter directed foam for the reﬂuxing axial veins, and phlebectomy for the varicose tributaries. Catheter-directed sclerotherapy was performed
in 18 GSVs. Closure at 1 week and at 6 months was
100%, and at1 year it was 86%.
Turtulici et al222 studied 37 patients with recurrent varicose veins. Ten patients had reﬂux in the SFJ, 21 had single or multiple recanalized and reﬂuxing perforator veins,
and 6 had a combination of SFJ reﬂux and perforator
vein reﬂux. All patients were treated with RFA. Recanalized axial veins were found in 4%, but no retreatment
was required. The vein diameters were small and the
Aberdeen Varicose Vein Severity scores of the limbs
decreased.
9.1.3. For patients with symptomatic recurrent varicosities due to persistent or recurrent reﬂux at the
groin, either EVLA or RFA can be used if there is a
straight GSV stump, long enough for thermal ablation.

Sclerotherapy or phlebectomy should be performed
for recurrence due to neovascularization.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Groin recurrence
