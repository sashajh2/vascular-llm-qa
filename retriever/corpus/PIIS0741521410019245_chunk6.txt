 No
significant difference in event rate across the three groups
was noted for any stroke. The risk of spinal cord ischemia
(SCI) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) was higher in
open repair compared with endovascular repair and nonoperative management (SCI: 9% open vs 3% endovascular and
3% nonoperative, P ⫽ .01; ESRD: 8% open vs 5% endovascular and 3% nonoperative, P ⫽ .01). Compared with
endovascular repair, open repair was associated with increased risk of graft infection and systemic infections, most
commonly pneumonia. With a median follow-up of 2 years,
there was a trend toward increased risk of a secondary
procedure in endovascular compared with open repair (P ⫽
.07).
VALUES
In developing the recommendation that endovascular
repair should be performed preferentially over open surgical repair or nonoperative management, the committee
placed a significantly higher value on preventing catastrophic complications of thoracic aortic repair (death,
stroke, and spinal cord ischemia) and a lower value on
potential adverse events such as endoleak, need for reintervention, and device failures. The committee also placed less
value on possible late-term outcomes that remain unknown
at this time. Furthermore, the committee acknowledges the
off-label use of a medical device in the context of endovascular repair of traumatic thoracic aortic injury, although
there are ongoing studies investigating the safety and efficacy in this application; however, as we believe that pre-

Consensus
We suggest that endovascular repair be performed preferentially
over open surgical repair or nonoperative management.
We suggest urgent (⬍24 hours) repair, and at the latest prior to
hospital discharge.
We suggest expectant management with serial imaging
