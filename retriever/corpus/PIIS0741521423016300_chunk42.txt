Recommendation 11
In a person with diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and a foot
ulcer or gangrene who is being considered for revascularisation, evaluate the entire lower extremity arterial circulation
(from aorta to foot) with detailed visualisation of the below
knee and pedal arteries.

Best Practice Statement

Rationale
As per Recommendations 1 e 4, clinical examination
and bedside testing should be the ﬁrst line testing undertaken to diagnose the presence of PAD. When
revascularisation is being considered further anatomical information on the arteries of the lower limb
should be obtained to assess the presence, severity,
and distribution of arterial stenoses or occlusions. In
this process, adequate imaging of the tibial and pedal
vessels is of critical importance, particularly in planning

to adequately deﬁne the arterial anatomy, or when
an endovascular intervention is planned. Arterial imaging should allow complete anatomical staging from
