CAS may be an option to reduce stroke risk before
CABG. Several studies demonstrate a trend toward
decreased stroke risk in patients treated with CAS before
CABG.543-545 A review of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample found a 62% higher perioperative stroke risk after
combined CEA and CABG (3.9%) compared with combined CAS and CABG (2.4%), with an OR of 1.62 (95% CI,
1.1-2.5).543 A more recent meta-analysis from Paraskevas
et al included 2,727 patients who had staged or sameday CAS-CABG with an overall 30-day combined stroke/
death risk of 7.9%. However, 80% had asymptomatic unilateral carotid artery stenosis.533 Shishehbor et al546
assessed three groups in mostly asymptomatic patients:
staged CEA-CABG, staged CAS-CABG, and combined
CEA-CABG. Staged CEA-CABG had the least favorable
risks of death, stroke and MI compared with the other
2 groups, which were similar. Overall, CAS-CABG was
favored for long-term outcomes after 1 year.546

THERAPY OF CAROTID DISEASE AND OTHER
MAJOR NONCARDIAC SURGERY
Overall, less than 0.1% to 4.3% of patients undergoing
noncardiac surgery will have a clinically overt perioperative stroke.547-550 Stroke risks range from 0.08% to 0.7%
of patients undergoing general surgery, 0.2% to 0.9%
with orthopaedic surgery, 0.6% to 0.9% lung operations,
and 0.8% to 3.0% of patients undergoing peripheral
vascular procedures.551,552 However, perioperative stroke
in these circumstances have devastating effects with as
high as 32% 30-day mortality and 58% major disability
