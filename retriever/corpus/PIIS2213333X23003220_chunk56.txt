hydroxyethylrutosides, calcium dobesilate, horse chestnut extract, red vine leaf extract and sulodexide for treatment of CVD, see Appendix I. Most studies with these
products have short (3-6 months) follow-ups; therefore,
long-term efﬁcacy and possible side effects of longterm treatment have not been formally assessed.
Clinical beneﬁt of MPFF.
Rationale. MPFF is composed of 90% diosmin and
10% hesperidin fraction (hesperidin, diosmetin, linarin,
and isorhoifolin). Its beneﬁcial effects in patients with
symptomatic varicose veins are related to the effect
on venous tone, microcirculation, trophic disorders,
edema, inﬂammation, leukocyte adhesion, and activation.101 Pharmaceutic formulations that increase intestinal absorption as micronized form, including the
MPFF represent an innovation and improvement of the
therapeutic efﬁcacy.
Evidence. MPFF has shown several effects beneﬁcial for
patients with varicose veins and CVD. Among them are
an increase of the venous tone, potentiation of the
venous response to norepinephrine,106 and antioxidant
and anti-inﬂammatory properties.107,108 Leukocytes
adhesion molecules inhibition was conﬁrmed in patients
with CEAP Class C2 to C4, in parallel to the improvement
of leg heaviness scores.109 Transient venous reﬂux was
reduced in patients with telangiectasias and reticular
veins treated with MPFF.110
A meta-analysis by Kakkos and Nicolaides14 analyzed
seven RCTs in 1692 patients with CVD (Table VII). Based
on high-quality evidence, the study concluded that
MPFF was highly effective in improving leg symptoms,
edema, and QOL in patients with CVD. The RELIEF study
enrolled 4527 patients with CEAP Class C0 to C4. Approximately 40% of patients belonged to CEAP Class C2. Participants were treated for a period of 6 months and had
signiﬁcant evolving improvement of symptoms, QOL
measured by the CIVIQ
