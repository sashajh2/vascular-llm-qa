2. A 72-year-old male with diabetes presents to his PCP’s oﬀce for a nonhealing ulcer to the
plantar aspect of his right foot. Laboratory results and x-ray imaging are unremarkable.
On examination, you note that his pulses are nonpalpable. Doppler examination reveals
monophasic signals. He has necrotic, nonviable tissue to the base of the wound. There is
no erythema or evidence of abscess. The patient has not been taking antibiotics. What
is the most likely cause of the non-healing in this scenario?
A. Pressure
B. Infection
C. Inadequate wound care
D. Peripheral vascular (arterial) disease
Answer
D. Peripheral vascular (arterial) disease
Discussion: This patient has nonpalpable pulses and monophasic doppler signals. Along
with necrotic tissue to the wound base, these findings are consistent with peripheral artery
disease (PAD). You may choose to order ankle-brachial index/pulse volume recording
studies. He should be referred to a vascular specialist for further workup before any
intervention is made. He does not have erythema or evidence of abscess on examination,
and therefore it is not likely that primary infection is the cause of nonhealing. The
scenario does not state what type of wound care the patient was receiving. In the presence
of PAD, the type of wound care does not matter as much until the PVD is addressed
first. Without adequate blood fow to a wound, the wound will not have the nutrients
and cells necessary to heal. Bader MS. Diabetic foot infection. Am Fam Physician.

3. A 56-year-old male with hypertension, diabetes presents to the emergency department
with redness and purulence draining from his right great toe. His heart rate is 110

beats/min, his blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg, and his temperature is 38.5ºC. Laboratory tests show a white blood count of 14,000/µL. An x-ray of his foot is performed,
which demonstrates gas in his right great toe. What is the best course of treatment?
