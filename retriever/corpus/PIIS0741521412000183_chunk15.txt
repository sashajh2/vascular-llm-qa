 or by indirect injection through an arm
vein.45 Indirect CTV may be performed as part of imaging
protocols for pulmonary embolism (PE)46 and avoids the
need for foot vein puncture in a swollen limb. Pooled
analysis of 13 studies comparing CTV vs ultrasound imaging or venography (largely in patients presenting with
symptoms of PE) showed an overall sensitivity and specificity of 95.9% and 95.2% for the detection of DVT.47
Smaller studies have also shown that CTV has the capacity
to detect iliac thromboses that were missed on standard
ultrasound protocols.43
MRV has also been demonstrated to be accurate in the
diagnosis of DVT. A meta-analysis of 14 studies using a
variety of MRV techniques compared with venography or
ultrasound imaging demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 95.7% and 92.9%, respectively.48 In a series of 45
patients with acetabular fractures, Montgomery et al42
found that contrast venography identified only one of 11
pelvic thrombi documented by MRV. Others have similarly
shown MRV is accurate in the diagnosis of pelvic
thrombosis.49
If duplex ultrasound imaging suggests the presence of
iliac thrombosis but is not able to define the most proximal
extent of thrombus, it may be reasonable to proceed di-

1454 Meissner et al

rectly to contrast venography in anticipation of intervention. However, further noninvasive imaging of the pelvis
with CTV or MRV should be considered when a clinical
suspicion of DVT persists despite a negative result on an
ultrasound examination. If iliofemoral thrombus is identified, definitive contrast imaging can be performed at the
time of any planned intervention.
Selection of the appropriate study depends on patient
characteristics and institutional expertise. In strongly recommending the use of alternative imaging in such situations, a high value is placed on identifying isolated iliofemoral thrombosis that may be missed by routine ultrasound
imaging, although the cost-effectiveness of this approach
has not been evaluated nor have prospective management
trials been performed (Grade 1C).
