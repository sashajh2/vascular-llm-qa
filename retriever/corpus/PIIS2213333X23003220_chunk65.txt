iameter and VCSS, while one demonstrated correlation with VCSS components.124 The diameters were a
poor predictor of HRQOL, with no relationship to patients’ perceived impact on CVD. The review concluded
that vein diameters should not be used as a single
determinant of who needs venous intervention.124
Perrins et al examined the clinical and anatomical
outcomes of RFA of symptomatic small-diameter
GSVs.122 RFA of symptomatic small diameter GSV
(<5 mm) provided comparable clinical outcomes (vein
closure and improved VCSS at 3 months) and the study
suggested that patients with GSV size <5 mm beneﬁt
from RFA.122 Bendix et al123 reviewed the Vascular
Quality Initiative VV Registry and divided patients into
those with GSV <5 mm (group 1) vs those with GSV
$5 mm (group 2). Both groups had improvement in the
VCSS and HASTI scores. Group 2 had more complications, more adverse VTE events, required more anticoagulation, developed more recanalization and
missed more days of work than group 1. They authors
concluded that patients with a smaller vein size should
not be denied intervention based on size alone.123
5.2.1. In asymptomatic patients with C2 disease, prophylactic intervention does not prevent progression of
venous disease. Weight control, compression stockings, and avoiding prolonged standing may be
beneﬁcial.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Studies have noted progression with worsening CEAP class over time.125-127 This raises the question about the role of prophylactic intervention in
asymptomatic patients with varicose veins, to prevent
progression to symptomatic disease.
Evidence. As discussed before, the CEAP classiﬁcation
is not a severity scale but a classiﬁcation scheme for
