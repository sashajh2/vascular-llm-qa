ysms or acute
aortic syndromes. The goal of therapy is to reduce the
systolic blood pressure to <20 mm Hg and the heart
rate to <60 beats/min when possible before, during,
and after TEVAR (see exceptions in recommendations
for spinal cord protection). This is usually achieved with
intravenous beta blockers (or alpha/beta blockers) as

ﬁrst-line therapy. For patients who do not respond to or
are intolerant of beta blockers, calcium channel blockers
or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or blockers
can be used as alternatives or complementaries.73
For patients with dyslipidemia, treatment with a statin to
achieve a target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level
of <70 mg/dL is reasonable and may be helpful in controlling the progression of aneurysms.74 Counseling for smoking cessation, reduction of environmental tobacco
exposure, referral to special programs for cognitivebehavioral therapy, initiation of pharmacotherapy, or,
preferably, multimodal management to achieve complete tobacco abstinence is recommended for patients
who have active tobacco use or exposure.75,76
Recommendation 8: As hypertension is a modiﬁable
risk factor for the development of aortic aneurysms and
is associated with accelerated aortic growth and rupture,
we recommend that blood pressure be managed to the
adherence of the ACC/AHA guidelines.2 Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B
(Moderate)
Recommendation 9: We recommend interventions for
smoking cessation in patients with thoracic aortic disease as even passive exposure may increase the risk of
aortic rupture. Level of recommendation: Grade 1
(Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High)
Open repair vs TEVAR for TAA
Until recently, surgical management for elective TAA
repair required major open surgery, with a signiﬁcant
risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality. Centers
of excellence report impressively low mortality and spinal cord ischemia rates in elective cases of 4.8% and
4.6%, respectively.77 In tandem, the mortality after open
surgical treatment of ruptured TAA in highly specialized
practices has been reported to be close to 26%.78 In
contrast, the overall mortality rates in the United States
