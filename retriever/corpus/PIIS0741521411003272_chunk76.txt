7% at 2
years177,215,216 and up to 51% at 5 years.217-222 Most
studies reported 2-year clinical recurrence rates of 20% to
37% after conventional or cryostripping, when residual or
recurrent varicose veins noted by both the patient and the
surgeon were counted.216,220 In a 34-year follow-up study
of 125 limbs, Fischer et al221 noted ultrasonographic evidence of saphenofemoral reflux in 75 limbs (60%). Allegra
et al219 noted a 5-year recurrence rate of 25% in a large
study that included 1326 patients. Despite technically
correct surgery, confirmed with postoperative duplex
scanning, recurrence at the SFJ occurred in 13%, at the
saphenopopliteal junction in 30%, and at both in 36%.
Factors predicting recurrence were SSV reflux, perforating vein incompetence, and post-thrombotic deep vein
incompetence.
A consensus document on REVAS found that the main
reasons for recurrence after surgery were technical and
tactical errors, neovascularization at the groin, and progression of the underlying disease.217 In a multicenter registry
that included 199 limbs of 170 patients with REVAS, the
most frequent sources of recurrent reflux were the SFJ

26S Gloviczki et al

(47.2%), followed by leg perforators (54.7%), neovascularization (20%), and technical failure (19%); both neovascularization and technical failure occurred in 17%, and in 35%,
the cause was uncertain or unknown.215 In a study of 279
limbs with recurrent varicose veins at the groin, Geier et
al223 found a long residual saphenofemoral stump in about
two-thirds of cases, recurrences became apparent after a
mean time interval of 6.3 years, and symptoms occurred
after a mean of 8.5 years.
Evaluation. Treatment of symptomatic recurrent varicose veins should be performed
