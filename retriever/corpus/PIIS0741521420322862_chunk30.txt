from revascularization given the potential for adverse
sequelae, including those undergoing aortic reconstruction (both open and endovascular), those with involvement of all three of the mesenteric vessels, and those
undergoing treatment for mesenteric artery aneurysms
in which treatment would disrupt the collateral vessels.
Detailed justiﬁcation
Treatment goals for patients with CMI are to reverse the
symptoms, facilitate weight gain, prevent the development of AMI, and improve the patient’s overall quality
of life. Similar to most medical and surgical therapies,
the treatment algorithm represents a balance between
the natural history of the disease process and the risks/
beneﬁts associated with treatment. Unfortunately, the
natural history of CMI is not well-deﬁned, given the lack
of randomized, controlled trials and the presence of a
true noninterventional control group in the observational
studies. Furthermore, it would seem unethical to propose a clinical trial with a noninterventional group given
the sequelae of AMI, including death. The natural history
of CMI has largely been deﬁned by the clinical course of
patients before intervention as reﬂected by the duration
of symptoms or the development of AMI. Admittedly,
there is a tremendous amount of selection bias in these
studies. Untreated patients with CMI can clearly waste
away from inanition and/or progress to AMI, and it has
been reported that the 5-year mortality rate for untreated patients approaches 100%.81 Furthermore, up to
50% of patients with AMI present with thrombosis of
an existing lesion and antecedent symptoms consistent
with CMI.82 In contrast, revascularization, either open or
endovascular, has been associated with excellent results
in terms of both symptomatic relief and long-term
graft or mesenteric vessel patency.31,35,83,84 Notably,
Blauw et al85 surveyed patients before and after revascularization for CMI using the Euroqol-5D survey tool and
reported that revascularization was associated with an
overall improvement in quality of life with improvement
within the activities and pain/discomfort domains.
There may be a role for noninterventional treatment for
patients with CMI, although this role may be more
