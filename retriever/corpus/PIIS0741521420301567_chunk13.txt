 (High).
3.3: In patients with intrahepatic aneurysms, we recommend coil embolization of the affected artery, Level of
Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). In patients with large intrahepatic
aneurysms, we recommend resection of the involved
lobe of liver to avoid signiÔ¨Åcant liver necrosis, Level of
Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence:
C (Low).
4.1: We suggest abdominal axial imaging to screen for
concomitant intra-abdominal aneurysms in patients
who did not have CTA at the time of HAA diagnosis

Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
4.2: We suggest one-time screening CTA or magnetic
resonance angiography of the head, neck, and chest for
those patients with nonatherosclerotic causes of HAA.
Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of
Evidence: B (Moderate).
5.1: We suggest annual follow-up with CTA or noncontrast-enhanced computed tomography to observe
patients with asymptomatic HAA. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B
(Moderate).
Superior mesenteric artery aneurysm (SMAA). 1.1: In
patients with SMAAs, we recommend computed tomography angiography (CTA) as the diagnostic tool of choice.
Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of
Evidence: B (Moderate).
1.2: We recommend mesenteric angiography to delineate anatomy in preoperative planning for SMAA repair.
Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality
of Evidence: B (Moderate).
2.1: We recommend repair of all true SMAAs and pseudoaneurysms as soon as the diagnosis is made regardless
of size. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: A (High).
2.2: We suggest careful observation of SMAA because of
dissection unless refractory symptoms develop. Level of
Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence:
