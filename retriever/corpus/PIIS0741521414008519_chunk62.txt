Venous outﬂow obstruction has been underappreciated as a cause of venous hypertension and associated
venous disease because of lack of a noninvasive screening

study that reliably identiﬁes the problem.157,173 Venous
duplex ultrasound of the femoral vein may provide indirect
evidence of outﬂow obstruction with monophasic waveforms, loss of respiratory variation in the femoral tracing,
or poor augmentation of the signal with distal limb
compression.174 Although the diagnostic accuracy of
duplex ultrasound may be improved by performing direct
duplex ultrasound examination of iliocaval veins, reliable
and reproducible imaging may be limited by body habitus,
intestinal gas, and operator variability.175 Use of venous
plethysmography for identiﬁcation of venous obstruction
has also been described, but venous plethysmography is
not widely available, limiting its usefulness as a screening
modality.176
For improved diagnostic accuracy, patients with VLU
and suspected thrombotic or nonthrombotic venous
obstruction should undergo additional contrast imaging
with computed tomography venography (CTV) or magnetic resonance venography (MRV).177-179 In one study,
37% of patients with prior healed or active VLUs had evidence of iliocaval venous obstruction >50% and 23%
>80% on CTV or MRV, with a higher propensity in
women, with prior history of DVT, and with evidence of
deep venous reﬂux on duplex ultrasound.180
Whereas screening CTV and MRV may provide additional information about potential venous outﬂow obstruction, diagnosis should be conﬁrmed by contrast
venography and intravascular ultrasound. Imaging with
intravascular ultrasound with cross-sectional views of the
vein and adjacent structures has high diagnostic accuracy
in determining presence of iliocaval thrombus burden or
iliocaval compression due to May-Thurner syndrome or
other adjacent structures, which may have bearing on additional therapeutic options.181-183
