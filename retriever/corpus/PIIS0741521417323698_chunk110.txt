 avoid hypertension and to minimize the risk of uncontained rupture. Permissive hypotension is appropriate
with limited resuscitation and should be maintained
during transfer. Blood products are preferred to treat
hypotension, but transfer should not be delayed if blood
products are not readily available.457

Evaluation by an Emergency Physician of Any Patient
Suspected of Having a Ruptured AAA
Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) protocol
General assessment
Vital sign monitoring

Diagnosis
Clinical diagnosis of a rAAA in patients:
• Age > 50 with abdominal or back pain AND hypotension
• Known AAA and symptoms of abdominal or back pain,
hypotension, or impending cardiovascular collapse
Radiologic conf irmation (ultrasound or CT) only required when:
• Alternative diagnosis is more likely on clinical grounds

Immediate Management
Intravenous access with two large bore peripheral IVs (central
and/or arterial not immediately necessary)
Permissive hypotension (to maintain a mental status and target
systolic pressure 70-90 mmHg)
Lab work or x-rays should only be obtained to conf irm the
diagnosis of rAAA

Consideration of Transfer to Regional Center
If appropriate vascular services cannot be provided:
• Patients with good f unctional status and without severe
co-morbidity should be transf erred without delay
• Patients previously declined elective surgery should still
be considered f or transf er and subsequent treatment
• Patient should be discussed with a receiving vascular
surgeon:
• Goals of care
• Medical comorbidities
• Hemodynamics
