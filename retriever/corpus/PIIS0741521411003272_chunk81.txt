For treatment of the incompetent great saphenous vein, we suggest high ligation
and inversion stripping of the saphenous vein to the level of the knee.
To reduce hematoma formation, pain, and swelling, we recommend postoperative
compression. The recommended period of compression in C2 patients is 1 week.
For treatment of small saphenous vein incompetence, we recommend high ligation
of the vein at the knee crease, about 3 to 5 cm distal to the saphenopopliteal
junction, with selective invagination stripping of the incompetent portion of the
vein.
To decrease recurrence of venous ulcers, we recommend ablation of the
incompetent superficial veins in addition to compression therapy.
We suggest preservation of the saphenous vein using the ambulatory conservative
hemodynamic treatment of varicose veins (CHIVA) technique only selectively in
patients with varicose veins, when performed by trained venous interventionists.
We suggest preservation of the saphenous vein using the ambulatory selective
varicose vein ablation under local anesthesia (ASVAL) procedure only selectively
in patients with varicose veins.
We recommend ambulatory phlebectomy for treatment of varicose veins,
performed with saphenous vein ablation, either during the same procedure or at
a later stage. If general anesthesia is required for phlebectomy, we suggest
concomitant s
