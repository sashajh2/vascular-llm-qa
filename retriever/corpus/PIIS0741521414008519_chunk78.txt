 suggest a combination of mechanical disruption and antibiotic therapy as most likely to be successful in eradicating
venous leg ulcer infection. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 4.12: Systemic Antibiotics
We recommend that venous leg ulcers with clinical
evidence of infection be treated with systemic antibiotics guided by sensitivities performed on wound culture. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Oral antibiotics are preferred initially, and the duration
of antibiotic therapy should be limited to 2 weeks unless persistent evidence of wound infection is present.
[GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Although there is a lack of clinical studies evaluating
the speciﬁc treatment of infected VLUs, available evidence supports systemic antibiotic treatment of patients
with clinical evidence of infection and ulcers containing
> 1  106 CFU/g of bacteria on quantitative culture.242
Aggressive mechanical débridement of infected VLUs
whenever possible is also suggested, although there is a
lack of high-quality evidence indicating that débridement improves results in the treatment of infected
ulcers.
Guideline 4.13: Topical Antibiotics for Infected
Wounds
We suggest against use of topical antimicrobial
agents for the treatment of infected venous leg ulcers.
[GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
There is a lack of evidence suggesting that topical antibiotics have a positive effect on the treatment of infected
VLUs or on the healing of noninfected VLUs. Manizgate
et al reported that in a prospective study of two silverreleasing dressings, neither dressing had an impact on the
level of bioburden identiﬁed in treated VLUs.243
Conversely, in another study, Lantis and Gendics found
that a sustained-release silver sulfadiazine foam reduced
the level of bacteria cultured from infected VLUs, but there
was no correlation with an improvement in wound size.241
A Cochrane review on the use of topical silver for infected
VLUs concluded that there is insufﬁcient evidence to
recommend the use of silver-containing dressings or topical
agents for treatment of infected or contaminated chronic
wounds.244
