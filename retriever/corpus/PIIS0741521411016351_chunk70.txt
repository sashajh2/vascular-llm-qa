 lesion.
Therapy in these patients is directed at removing the
causative lesion at the carotid bifurcation. Again, some
surgeons advocate heparin therapy in the immediate preoperative period if intracranial hemorrhage has been excluded, but this is based on personal experience rather than
reported data. Urgent CEA in these patients has been
associated with an increased risk of stroke compared with
“elective” interventions. Overall, however, the results of
surgery in patients with crescendo TIA are better than that
of stroke in evolution. Systematic reviews of the literature
for crescendo TIA report rates of stroke and death of 6.5%
(95% CI, 3.4%-10.4%) and stroke, MI, and death of 10.9%
(95% CI, 5.5%-17.9%). The comparable end points for
stroke in evolution include stroke and death rates of 16.9%
(95% CI, 9.2%-26.2%), and stroke, MI and death rates of
20.8% (95% CI, 13.2%-29.6%).252 Although there are no
data comparing CAS and CEA in these patients, the presumptive increase in embolic potential of these plaques
suggests that CEA would be preferred to CAS when the
former is feasible.
4. Acute postintervention stroke or occlusion. Patients who undergo carotid intervention may suffer stroke
in the early postintervention period. Treatment aims at
restoring intracranial blood flow to normal levels and depends on identifying the etiology of the stroke. In general, treatment decisions should be made as expeditiously
as possible. Stroke that occurs immediately after CEA is
considered secondary to a technical defect at the operative site, until proven otherwise. Other etiologies of
stroke in the immediate postoperative period include
embolization, intraoperative watershed infarction, and
intracranial hemorrhage.

Of these four, early thrombosis at the endarterectomy
site is the most common.253 The status of the endarterectomy site should be determined. In most cases,
