 for open repair because of a history of MI or
cardiac revascularization, stable angina, valvular heart
disease, signiﬁcant arrhythmia, uncontrolled congestive
heart failure, forced expiratory volume in 1 second <1 L,
or serum creatinine concentration >2.3 mg/dL.309 However, of those randomized to EVAR, only 179 of 197
(91%) underwent surgery; 14 deaths and 9 ruptures
occurred before surgery, which was performed at a
median of 55 days after randomization. Operative
mortality for those randomized to EVAR was 8.4%
(6.4% for elective repair). Of 207 patients randomized to
observation, 70 (34%) crossed over to EVAR; 64 (31%)
were repaired electively, with an operative mortality
of 3%.
Among the many lessons learned from EVAR 2 and
other data, it is evident that there is a subgroup of
patients not ﬁt for open repair who are also at high risk
for EVAR. It is this subgroup that may be identiﬁed using
the VQI risk model and should be considered for nonoperative management. There may also be patients who
although they are at high risk for open surgery are at
reasonable risk for EVAR. In addition, as noted in onethird of patients randomized to observation in EVAR 2,

ﬁtness may be improved by optimization of comorbid
disease to the extent that EVAR may then be considered.
We suggest informing high-risk patients of their VQI
perioperative mortality risk score for them to make an
informed decision to proceed with aneurysm repair.
