1.3.3. We recommend that a complete DU scanning
examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities
includes diameter measurements with the patient’s
leg in the dependent position, from the anterior to posterior wall, at the SFJ, in the GSV at the proximal thigh
and knee, in the AAGSV, and in the SSV at the SPJ or
proximal calf. Images of both normal and abnormal
ﬁndings should be documented in the patient’s
records.

Rationale. To use DU scanning for evaluation and
follow-up of patients, appropriate documentation of
both normal and abnormal ﬁndings in the patient’s
records is mandatory. A complete DU scanning examination for CVD should include visualization, compressibility, venous ﬂow with and without augmentation,
measurement of duration of reﬂux, and measurements
of the vein diameter.64 The vein diameter should be
acquired in the dependent position as a transverse,
anterior wall to posterior wall measurement. Spectral
Doppler waveforms with the extremity or extremities in
a dependent position demonstrating the baseline ﬂow
and response to distal augmentation must be recorded.
If present, the reﬂux duration of retrograde ﬂow must
be measured with calipers in the following segments:
common femoral vein, SFJ, GSV at the proximal thigh

and knee, femoral vein at the mid-thigh, popliteal vein,
AAGSV and PAGSV (when identiﬁed), and SSV at the
SPJ or at the mid-calf, if SPJ is not identiﬁed.65 Measurements of reﬂux in the calf veins is optional. Axial
reﬂux is deﬁned as uninterrupted retrograde venous
ﬂow from the groin to the calf, either to the upper calf
or to the ankle. Superﬁcial reﬂux will be
