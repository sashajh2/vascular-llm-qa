be carefully based on the particular anatomy and any
associated clinical conditions as well as the underlying
condition of the patient.
The traditional surgical management of SAA includes
proximal and distal ligation and aneurysmectomy for lesions in the proximal or middle portion of the splenic artery. Revascularization of the distal splenic artery is
generally not warranted because collateral ﬂow to the
spleen is maintained by the short gastric arteries. For
more distal lesions adjacent to the splenic hilum and
for mycotic aneurysms, excision with or without splenectomy has traditionally been the most commonly

aberrant SAA located in the retropancreatic position, in
which traditional surgical exposure would be exceedingly difﬁcult.101
Endovascular approaches to managing visceral artery
aneurysms offer the beneﬁt of low procedural morbidity
and mortality and are generally considered to be the
preferred initial approach to most anatomically suitable
visceral aneurysms considered appropriate for intervention.1 Endoluminal ablation of SAAs has been shown in
multiple reported series to be highly technically successful, but there is some concern of end-organ malperfusion
and aneurysm reperfusion during follow-up.1,102
Endovascular treatment options include coil embolization of the splenic artery both proximal and distal to the
aneurysm itself, effectively “trapping” the lesion. Other
options for a saccular-type aneurysm include embolization of the aneurysm sac itself with coils or cyanoacrylate
glue and occlusion of the lesion with percutaneous or
open thrombin injection.103 In addition, stent grafting
has been performed, particularly for saccular lesions of
the mid splenic artery. There has been concern about
splenic infarction or pancreatitis when embolization of

In a review of 48 endovascular procedures for visceral artery pseudoaneurysms, 20 interventions on the splenic artery were performed.1 Six end-
