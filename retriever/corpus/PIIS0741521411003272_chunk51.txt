 or to prevent recurrence of varicose veins after
treatment. However, these results could have been confounded by the high number of noncompliant patients
included in these studies.34
The level of compression for patients with class C2
disease is also disputed. A meta-analysis by Amsler and
Blattler141 of 11 RCTs suggested that in healthy patients,
in those with C1 to C3 disease, and in those after varicose
vein surgery, medium compression stockings (â¬Ž20 mm
Hg) may add no benefit over that obtained with a compression of between 10 and 15 mm Hg.
Until further data on appropriate tension of elastic
garments are available, for patients with simple varicose
veins (class C2), the SVS/AVF Guideline Committee suggests graded prescription stockings with an ankle pressure
of 20 to 30 mm Hg (GRADE 2C). The most common
length recommended is knee-high stockings, although
thigh-high stockings and pantyhose are also available and
may be appropriate for many patients. Skin breakdown and

frank necrosis after incorrectly measured or applied garments have been reported.142 The Committee recommends that only those with the necessary skills and training
prescribe stockings for patients with venous disease.
The efficacy of conservative vs surgical treatment for
varicose veins was studied in an RCT by Michaels et al.143
The Randomised Clinical Trial, Observational Study and
Assessment of Cost-Effectiveness of the Treatment of Varicose Veins (REACTIV) trial randomized 246 patients with
simple varicose veins (class C2) to conservative management or surgery. Conservative treatment included lifestyle
advice relating to exercise, leg elevation, management of
weight and diet, and the use of compression hosiery. In the
surgical arm, patients received the same lifestyle advice but
also underwent high ligation, stripping, and phlebectomies. In the first 2 years after treatment, there was a
significant QOL benefit for surgery of 0.083 qualityadjusted life-years (QALY; 95% CI, 0.005-0.16 QALY)
based on the SF-6D score (derived from scores on
