 patients be followed up for $3 months to assess
the need for staged phlebectomy or ultrasoundguided sclerotherapy for persistent or recurrent
symptoms. Longer follow-up is recommended for
patients with recurrent symptoms and for patients
who participate in clinical trials.

During the past two decades, the evaluation and minimally invasive endovenous management of varicose veins
and more advanced forms of lower extremity chronic
venous insufﬁciency have progressed. The number of
endovenous procedures, including thermal and
nonthermal interventions, has increased rapidly,1-3 and
>90% of these have been performed in an ofﬁce setting
as outpatient procedures.4 In the United States, between
2005 and 2014, the total annual claims for venous procedures in the Medicare fee-for-service beneﬁciaries
increased from 95,206 to 332,244, for a compound annual
growth rate of 15%.4 With the report of the 5-year followup data from multiple, prospective randomized
controlled trials (RCTs)5-13 and the 10-year follow-up of
one of the RCTs,14 the long-term effectiveness of different
procedures is now available to help physicians make
informed decisions on treatment recommendations. The
widely accepted and frequently used CEAP (Clinical presentation, Etiology, Anatomy, Pathophysiology) classiﬁcation and reporting standards were recently updated,15
and a multiple society Delphi consensus document was
published on the appropriate use criteria for the management of chronic venous disease (CVD).16 The assessment

has also improved, and the use of generic and diseasespeciﬁc quality of life (QoL) instruments has become the
reference standard for outcomes assessment.17-19
In 2011, the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the
American Venous Forum (AVF) published the ﬁrst
evidence-based guidelines on “the care of patients with
