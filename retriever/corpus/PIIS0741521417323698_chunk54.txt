. Whereas a linear correlation has been noted between C-reactive protein and
aortic diameter,160 this observation is at odds with at
least one prior report.161 A number of microRNAs related
to smooth muscle cell function and collagen formation
have also been suggested as possible AAA biomarkers.56,162-165 At the current time, none of these
candidates has the sensitivity, speciﬁcity, or rigorous
clinical validation to be relied on as a diagnostic or
prognostic indicator for rupture risk.166,167
Genetic markers identifying risk of aortic aneurysm.
Genetic inﬂuences in AAA disease, ﬁrst suggested by Clifton,168 have been demonstrated by twin studies169 and
by formal segregation analyses.170 Genetic predisposition
likely represents small contributions from a large
number of risk alleles, with the effect dependent on the
population under consideration as well as relevant environmental considerations, such as cigarette smoking.171
Most genomic studies have investigated singlenucleotide polymorphisms in genes related to AAA
pathogenesis. Potential AAA-related single-nucleotide
polymorphisms have been identiﬁed in genes encoding

ACE, 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, angiotensin II type 1 receptor, interleukin 10, matrix metalloproteinase 3, and transforming growth factor b
receptor II.172
The use of genome-wide DNA linkage analyses relies on
traditional proband and family tree studies. Examination
of families with two or more members with an AAA has
identiﬁed variations on chromosomes 4 and 19.172 Allelic
variation at the q31 locus on chromosome 4 may inﬂuence endothelin signaling and respiratory epithelial
response to injury, such as cigarette smoking.173,174
Several genome-wide association studies have also
been conducted for various cardiovascular diseases,175
at least three of which have focused on AAA.176 A number of genetic loci have been implicated in AAA pathogenesis (Table V).172 The noncoding region of
chromosome 9p21 has been identiﬁed as an important
source of heritable risk for coronary
