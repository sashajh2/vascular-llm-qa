 repair. Speciﬁcally, of 48 surgical reconstructions, DUS identiﬁed 14 graft abnormalities in 12 reconstructions after the initial 30 days. Only seven
endovascular reconstructions and two patients had presented with thrombosis of the stent-grafts within
2 months of treatment. The results from the other ﬁve
DUS scans did not result in any intervention by the
time of the report.46,47 Stenosis is the principal cause
of graft thrombosis, and the SVS guidelines for surveillance after arterial procedures are relevant to PAA
repair, with the recommendation for DUS surveillance
at 3, 6, and 12 months in the ﬁrst year and then annually,
coupled with a physical examination.45 In addition, the
surveillance of the residual aneurysm sac for enlargement is important, because an “endoleak” from genicular branches can result in sac enlargement after OPAR
or EPAR.48 An expanding PAA after treatment has
been documented to be at risk of rupture.62-65 Thus, evidence of residual aneurysm sac enlargement should
encourage serial follow-up examinations and consideration of intervention to prevent potential aneurysm
compression symptoms and/or rupture with clinical
sequelae, including limb loss. Postprocedural use of
atherosclerotic risk factor modiﬁcation, smoking cessation, and pharmacotherapy with statins and antiplatelet
agents should be continued, although data regarding
these treatments have stemmed from management
of PAD rather than PAAs.27 No meaningful data are
available regarding anticoagulation therapy after endovascular repair of PAAs, because most studies have not
reported speciﬁc postoperative medical therapy. Those
that have reported it used antiplatelet therapy. It is
reasonable to use anticoagulation therapy instead of
antiplatelet therapy, extrapolating from the favorable
data for prosthetic graft patency with anticoagulation
therapy. However, a large analysis of meta-analyses
and randomized controlled trials concluded that the
best prophylaxis for vein bypass is anticoagulant therapy and, for prosthetic grafts, dual antiplatelet therapy.66-68
