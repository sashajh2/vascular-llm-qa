In contrast, CEA should be avoided in asymptomatic
patients with serious systemic disease. Analysis of 645 patients with in-stent restenosis in the VQI database

showed no signiﬁcant differences in perioperative and 1year outcomes between CEA vs restenting or PTA. However, CEA was offered to patients who are more severely
ill than redo CAS, resulting in signiﬁcantly higher mortality (3.7% vs 0.9%; P ¼ .02).473
Summary and recommendations for treatment of
restenosis following CAS.
1. Most asymptomatic patients (>70% restenosis)
should be treated with aggressive medical
management.
2. Symptomatic patients and progressive lesions should
be offered an endovascular option ﬁrst.
3. Evidence on PTA vs drug-coated balloon vs restenting is lacking.

Acute carotid occlusion
Acute carotid occlusion commonly presents with cerebral or retinal ischemia, and is associated with poor clinical outcomes.474-476 Acute carotid occlusion represents
6% to 15% of patients with acute ischemic stroke.477 Patients usually bear high National Institutes of Health
Stroke Scale scores because of severe neurologic deﬁcits,
with only 2% to 12% achieving good recovery, 40% to
69% having a severe deﬁcit, and 16% to 55% dying from
infarction.478-480 Carotid occlusion can occur after carotid stenting or endarterectomy owing to technical
problems or it may result from underlying cardiac pathology such as atrial ﬁbrillation. Female sex, age, history
of embolism, and higher B-type natriuretic peptide levels
have been identiﬁed as risk factors for proximal carotid
axis occlusion in patients with atrial ﬁbrillation.481
Acute ICA occlusion is a therapeutic challenge because
of poor neurologic outcome and paucity of effective
therapeutic options.482 Treatment
