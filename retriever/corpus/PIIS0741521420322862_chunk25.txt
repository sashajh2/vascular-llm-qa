endovascular intervention owing to better visualization
of the lumen, higher spatial resolution, and faster
acquisition times.58,66-68
MRA affords many of the same advantages as CTA for
the diagnosis of CMI and should be considered an alternative modality.66,69 Gadolinium-enhanced MRA was
shown to have an overall sensitivity and speciﬁcity of
greater than 95 % when compared with catheterbased arteriography for the detection of signiﬁcant
mesenteric artery stenoses.70 The interobserver variability
was excellent, but the degree of stenosis was consistently
overestimated owing to the lack of submillimeter resolution.70,71 The limitations of MRA include the inability to
scan patients with pacemakers, inability of patients
with claustrophobia to tolerate the closed space, lengthy
examination times, and the inability to assess patients
with mesenteric stents.66 Furthermore, MRA is not as
helpful to characterize the degree of calciﬁcation in the
target vessels or inﬂow arteries for planning revascularization, although it can be supplemented with a noncontrast CT scan. Caution must be used when administering
gadolinium to patients with chronic kidney disease and/
or on dialysis owing to the risk of nephrogenic systemic
ﬁbrosis.72 Furthermore, MR scanners are not as readily
available or widespread as CT scanners and most
vascular specialists feel more comfortable with CTAs.
Catheter-based arteriography has historically been
considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of
MAOD.48 However, owing to the evolution of the other
less invasive imaging modalities outlined elsewhere in
this article and the known complications associated
with the catheter-based procedures (eg, vessel perforation, bleeding, and peripheral emboli),73-75 the use of
catheter-based arteriography as a diagnostic test has
decreased signiﬁcantly.76 However, it can be useful
when the other less invasive imaging modalities are nondiagnostic (eg, extensive vessel calciﬁcation, prior stent,
other metallic artifact) or when percutaneous intervention is planned. Optimal biplane imaging includes
anterior-posterior (renal and aortoiliac), lateral (
