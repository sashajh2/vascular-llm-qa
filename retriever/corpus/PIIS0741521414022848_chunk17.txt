 The Heart Protection Study established the protective effects of statin therapy in reducing
mortality and cardiovascular events among individuals with
PAD.56 However, asymptomatic PAD patients were not
speciﬁcally included unless they met other criteria, such as
diabetes, hypertension, or other history of clinical cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. In addition to reducing
cardiovascular event rates, statin use has been associated with
improved lower extremity functioning.57 This improvement
was not related to improved lipid control or other confounding factors, and the association was noted in patients
with and without PAD. At present, the beneﬁt of lipidlowering therapy in patients with asymptomatic PAD who
lack other evidence of clinical cardiovascular disease (coronary, cerebral) or risk factors (diabetes, hypertension) remains unclear. Recently published treatment guidelines for
lipid-lowering therapy suggest the use of statins should be
considered in all individuals with an estimated 10-year risk of

major cardiovascular events >7.5%.58 This would seem to
include any individual with established PAD.6,50 Notably,
the recommended risk estimation algorithm does not
include evidence of PAD or the ABI value.58
Exercise and limb function. Although asymptomatic
PAD patients do not report exertional leg discomfort by deﬁnition, careful assessment reveals impaired lower extremity
function. An observational study of asymptomatic PAD patients demonstrated slower walking velocity, poorer standing
balance, and other negative functional associations, despite
correction for age, gender, smoking, and other comorbidities.59 Whether targeted physical therapy interventions can
reverse decline or improve functional performance and
quality of life (QoL) in this population remains unclear.
Surveillance of asymptomatic patients for disease
progression. In a small study of asymptomatic PAD patients, 35% of legs had developed new lower extremity arterial lesions on duplex scanning, and 26% of patients had
developed new IC #1 year after diagnosis.60 It is also
important to note that some asymptomatic PAD patients,
particularly those with diabetes, may develop CLI without
an antecedent history of claudication. The incremental
value and frequency of repeat ABI testing in asymptomatic
PAD is not established but may be useful in higher-risk
patients (eg, diabetic patients) or those with a lower
baseline ABI
