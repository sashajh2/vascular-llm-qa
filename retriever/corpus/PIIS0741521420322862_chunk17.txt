vall et al30 examining the national trends in
mortality for both CMI and AMI from the Nationwide
Inpatient Sample and Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention database reported that there has been a dramatic increase in the number of endovascular procedures for both conditions. This ﬁnding was associated
with a decrease in the population mortality for AMI but
no change for CMI, suggesting that the widespread
adoption of the endovascular approach was responsible
for the improved mortality trend for AMI. Notably, they

identiﬁed only 14,810 revascularizations for CMI over a 13year period (2000-2012) and this corresponded to
roughly 800 endovascular and 400 open revascularizations per year.
The diagnosis of CMI requires the appropriate clinical
presentation along with the presence of hemodynamically signiﬁcant MAOD. The classic symptoms of CMI
include postprandial abdominal pain, weight loss, and
food fear. However, it is important to note that this triad
is not always present, even at the time of revascularization, and patients can present with nonspeciﬁc intestinal
complaints, including abdominal discomfort, nausea/
vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation.6,31-34 The abdominal pain is described as mid-abdominal, crampy, or
dull. It usually occurs within 30 minutes after eating
and can persist for up to 6 hours as suggested by the
time course of postprandial hemodynamic changes outlined elsewhere in this article. Certain foods may exacerbate the symptoms, and, accordingly, patients tend to
avoid these foods by altering their eating habits.
The postprandial pain can lead to a decrease in oral
intake and food fear with the end results that patients
lose weight and can even become cachectic in the
more extreme scenarios. In one series of patients undergoing mesenteric revascularization, abdominal pain was
present in 96%, occurring after eating in only 74%,
whereas weight loss occurred in 84% and food fear in
45%.6 Notably,
