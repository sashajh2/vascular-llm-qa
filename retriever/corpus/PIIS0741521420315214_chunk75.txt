 present,
no clear conclusion can be drawn between hospital volume and outcomes after TEVAR. Importantly, even fewer
data are available to examine the role of individual clinician TEVAR volume and outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS
TEVAR is used to treat a myriad of aortic diseases.
Whereas there are no randomized, controlled trials
comparing open and endovascular DTA repair directly
and probably never will be, consensus documents, large
administrative data sets, and meta-analyses have
strongly suggested that TEVAR for isolated descending
TAAs should be the primary method of repair in both
the elective and emergent setting based on improved
short-term and midterm mortality as well as morbidity.
