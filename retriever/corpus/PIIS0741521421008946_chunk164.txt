inﬂow, requiring sternotomy. In general, a transthoracic
approach provides signiﬁcantly better long-term patency
than the cervical approach.518 However, these reconstructions require invasive incisions and longer recovery.
When there is a patent arch vessel to act as inﬂow, cervical open reconstructions may be less invasive, but they
also carry a risk of nerve or thoracic duct injury. Prosthetic
conduit can be used with excellent long term patency if
direct transposition of vessels is not possible.519 If grafts
are tunneled from the contralateral side, a retroesophageal tunnel can be used to avoid a graft in the anterior
neck.520 Because of the decreased morbidity compared
with the transthoracic approach, cervical reconstruction

Endovascular options include antegrade and retrograde angioplasty and stent with bare and covered
stents, as well as hybrid procedures of cervical endarterectomy with retrograde stenting.514 In the series from van
de Weijer et al,514 144 lesions in 114 patients were treated,
including 117 undergoing primary stenting for symptomatic arch lesions. The authors reported a technical success rate of 94% and no stroke or death at 30 days. At
a mean follow-up of 52 months, symptom-free survival
was 95% and 78% at 12 and 60 months, respectively.514
Embolic protection should be used if anatomically
feasible.
Tandem lesions include patients with signiﬁcant ICA
stenosis in combination with proximal ipsilateral common carotid or innominate stenosis of greater than
50%. Although open reconstructions may be technically
feasible, small case series suggest that a hybrid approach
