 common factors include hypertension,
diabetes, and smoking, making it difﬁcult to differentiate
between causation and correlation.
The effects of revascularization procedures on cognition. Both CEA and stenting, particularly CEA, decrease
stroke risk,5,203 but the effect of carotid intervention on
cognitive function has been long debated.629
Many studies show an improvement in cognitive function after carotid revascularization procedures. Presumably, improved cerebral perfusion and removal of
embolic source have a positive impact on brain health.
Qu et al630 showed that CEA for severe carotid stenosis
following a minor stroke improved neurocognitive,
ophthalmic, and acoustic functions compared with
those did not receive treatment. Several prospective
case-control studies showed that successful revascularization improves long-term cognitive performance
measured by cognitive batteries compared with those
who did not receive treatment,631,632 and by P300 auditory evoked potentials.633 Auditory evoked potentials
present changes of brain electrical activity caused by
auditory stimulus and the P300 wave is a measurable
direct reaction of the brain to a certain sensory, cognitive,
or mechanical stimulus.634,635
Fierstra et al636 also showed increased cerebral blood
ﬂow and cortical thickness measured by MRI for those
who received successful revascularization for severe
occlusive cerebrovascular disease in whom affected
brain areas exhibited “steal physiology.” However, owing
to rich intracranial collaterals, unilateral severe carotid
stenosis may not correspond with severe cortical

ischemia.637 Therefore, the beneﬁt of improved perfusion
cannot be generalized. Although the aforementioned
prospective longitudinal studies followed relatively
vigorous study protocols, the cognitive beneﬁt of carotid
intervention has not been deﬁnitely established and
thus, cannot be recommended owing to relatively small
sample sizes.
In addition, procedure-related subclinical microembolization is common and carotid stenting is associated with
a higher incidence of microembolization.382,638-641 The
cognitive impact of microembolization may be signiﬁcant, but the effects are difﬁcult to decipher.642-645
