To determine the need for revascularization of the celiac artery and its branches
in treating CAA, we suggest evaluating the status of the superior mesenteric
artery, gastroduodenal artery, and other relevant collateral circulation, which
must be carefully documented on preoperative CTA or angiography.

Historically, surgical treatment of CAAs was the only
feasible option for management. Open surgical options
included aneurysmectomy, aneurysmorrhaphy, aortoceliac or aortohepatic bypass, and ligation.98,116 The necessity of celiac or celiac branch revascularization depends
on several factors, including the location of the aneurysm
and the nature of the collateral mesenteric circulation.
Simple ligation of the celiac artery is a viable option in
a meaningful proportion of cases and has been undertaken in as much as 35% of reported surgically treated
cases in the literature.116 Ligation of the celiac artery is
reportedly well tolerated in most cases but may be problematic in patients with underlying hepatic disease. Ligation can be used for emergency treatment of celiac trunk
aneurysms with a relatively low risk of hepatic
ischemia.113 When the celiac artery is ligated, collateral
ﬂow is provided by the superior mesenteric, pancreaticoduodenal, and gastroduodenal arteries. The standard
surgical approach involving revascularization is celiac
aneurysmectomy with aortoceliac bypass grafting, most
commonly using prosthetic materials.117 In one reported
series of nine patients undergoing elective open surgical
repair, revascularization was performed in 89%.117

eurysms considered appropriate for intervention.1 Reported successful endovascular techniques have included
coil or glue embolization, percutaneous or open thrombin
injection, and endovascular stent grafting.3,124-129 One
report of ﬁve cases of endovascular occlusion of CAA
revealed no ischemic sequelae and uniformly good technical results.130 Late coil migration into the stomach with
