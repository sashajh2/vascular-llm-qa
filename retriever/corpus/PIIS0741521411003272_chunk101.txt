Sclerosing agents. The mechanisms of action of sclerosing solutions are the destruction of venous endothelial
cells, exposure of subendothelial collagen fibers, and ultimately, the formation of a fibrotic obstruction. The higher
the concentration of the solution and the smaller the vein,
the greater the endothelial damage. Delivery of the solution
as a foam prolongs the time of contact and amplifies the
effect of the chemical. In the United States, current FDAapproved agents for sclerotherapy include sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS), polidocanol, sodium morrhuate, and
glycerin, which is usually used with epinephrine. Hypertonic saline, although not approved for sclerotherapy in the
United States, has also been used for many years (Table
VII).
Osmotic agents. Hypertonic saline is a weak hyperosmolar sclerosing agent that causes dehydration of endothelial cells through osmosis, which leads to endothelial cell
death. The usual concentration is used in 23.4% sodium
chloride. One formulation is manufactured as Sclerodex
(Omega Laboratories Ltd, Montreal, Quebec, Canada).
Burning pain is frequent during injection. Extravasation
may cause skin ulcers and tissue necrosis, and osmotic
agents are used for occlusion of small veins only.
Detergents. Detergents destroy the endothelium by
denaturation of the cell surface proteins. STS (as Sotrade-
