 agents
and a statin after intervention, both open and endovascular.139 The optimal antiplatelet agent regimen and
endovascular interventions for CMI remains unresolved.
Peeters Weem et al140 performed a meta-analysis to
examine the optimal antiplatelet regimen after endovascular arterial procedures. They did not support the use of
dual antiplatelet therapy (vs monotherapy) and actually
advised against it owing to an increased bleeding risk.
A meta-analysis examining the impact of more intense
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering strategies
reported that all-cause mortality was decreased by 10%,
largely from deaths owing to coronary heart disease, for
each 1 mmol/L reduction in low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87-0.93; P < .0001).141
The COMPASS Trial reported that the combination of
rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) and aspirin (100 mg
daily) was associated with a lower incidence of major
adverse cardiac and limb events than aspirin alone for
patients with stable peripheral and cerebral arterial disease.142 However, the role for rivaroxaban and ticagrelor
for patients with CMI undergoing revascularization remains to be determined.143,144 Enteral feedings can usually be reintroduced shortly after revascularization. A
completion imaging study, typically a mesenteric DUS
examination, should be performed in the early postoperative period to conﬁrm the technical adequacy of the

Recommendation.
1. The choice of open surgical revascularization for CMI
should be determined by anatomy, comorbidities,
prior interventions and provider preference. (Ungraded Good Practice Statement)
Rationale and background
The choice of open revascularization for CMI should
