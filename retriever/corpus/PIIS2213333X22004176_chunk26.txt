0 ms.56 The investigators concluded that “standing
allows more deﬁnitive closure of competent valves.” To
investigate reﬂux, manual compression of the thigh and
calf is suggested to assess reﬂux. In addition, both the
Valsalva technique and rapid cuff deﬂation have been
recommended.59 Masuda et al63 found that reﬂux in the
upper thigh veinsdcommon femoral, femoral, deep
femoral, and GSVs was similarly demonstrated in both
normal and symptomatic states using cuff deﬂation and

the Valsalva technique. To standardize the evaluation of
reﬂux, the panel recommends the generally adopted
guidelines of using a Valsalva maneuver or distal
augmentation to assess the common femoral vein and
SFJ and either manual compression or standardized cuff
deﬂation distal to the segment of interest to assess the
more distal veins.56,62
Guideline 1.3.
1.3.1. We recommend that a complete DU scanning
examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities
includes transverse grayscale images without and with
transducer compression of the common femoral vein,
proximal, mid, and distal femoral veins, popliteal veins,
the SFJ, and the GSV and SSV.
Level of recommendation: ungraded good practice
statement
1.3.2. We recommend that a complete DU scanning
examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities
includes measurement of the spectral Doppler waveform using calipers. Reﬂux at baseline and in response
to Valsalva or distal augmentation in the common
femoral vein and at the SFJ should be document.
Reﬂux in response to distal augmentation in the midfemoral and popliteal veins, GSV at the proximal thigh
and knee, in the AAGSV and SSV at the SPJ or proximal
calf should also be documented.
Level of recommendation: ungraded good practice

1.3.3. We recommend that a complete DU scanning
examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities
includes diameter measurements with the patient’s
leg in the dependent position, from the anterior to posterior wall, at the SFJ, in the
