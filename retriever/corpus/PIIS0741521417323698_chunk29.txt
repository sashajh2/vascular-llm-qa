Late rupture of AAA after EVAR

AAA, Abdominal aortic aneurysm; CTA, computed tomography angiography; DUS, duplex ultrasound; EVAR, endovascular aneurysm repair; ICU,
intensive care unit; MI, myocardial infarction; MRA, magnetic resonance angiography.

Consistent with prior estimates,34-38 an AAA was more
likely among men (OR, 5.7) and less common in
Hispanics (OR, 0.7), African Americans (OR, 0.7), and
Asian Americans (OR, 0.7).
This study also conﬁrmed the close epidemiologic
association of cigarette smoking and aneurysmal disease. A smoking history of <0.5 pack per day for up to
10 years carried a signiﬁcant increased risk of an AAA
(OR, 2.6), which increased in a dose-dependent manner
such that smoking more than one pack per day for >35
years was associated with a 12-fold increased risk
(OR, 12.1). Reduced risk was noted for smoking cessation,
diabetes mellitus, eating fruits and vegetables more than
three times a week, and exercise more than once a week.
The protective effects of healthy diet and physical activity
have been conﬁrmed in other reports.39-41 Increasing risk
has also been noted with increased salt intake,42 high
blood pressure, concomitant peripheral arterial disease
and cerebrovascular disease, and family history of AAA
(Table II).33
Given the prevalence of AAA-related risk factors in the
United States, the prevalence of AAA, as deﬁned by an

aortic diameter >3 cm, was estimated at 1.4% among
