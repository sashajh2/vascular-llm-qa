5% CI, 1.0-2.7). After adjustment for all
patient-level factors, provider volume remained an independent predictor of outcome, with signiﬁcantly
increased odds of mortality for volume quintile 1 (OR,
2.6; 95% CI, 1.3-5.2) and quintile 2 (12-22 CEA/year) (OR,
2.1; 95% CI, 1-4.3) surgeons. The authors concluded that
surgeon characteristics impact outcomes, with the best
results offered by high-volume, mid-career, specialty
trained surgeons.573
Kuehnl et al574 also reported on the association of
annual hospital volume with risk of in-hospital stroke or
death following CEA and carotid stenting by analyzing
the Statutory German Carotid Quality Assurance database. Hospitals were categorized into empirically determined quintiles according to annual case volume. The
resulting volume thresholds were 10, 25, 46, and 79 for
CEA and 2, 6, 12, and 26 for CAS procedures, and the analysis included 17,575 CAS procedures and 161,448 CEA. For
CEA patients, the crude risk of stroke or death decreased
from 4.2% (95% CI, 3.6%-4.9%) in low-volume hospitals
(ﬁrst quintile 1-10 CEA per year) to 2.1% (2.0%-2.2%) in
hospitals providing 80 or more CEA per year (ﬁfth

quintile; P < .001 for trend). The overall risk of any death
or stroke in CAS patients was 3.7% (3.5%-4%), but no
trend was observed for annual volume (P ¼ .304). Riskadjusted analysis conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant inverse relationship between hospital volume and risk of stroke or death
after CEA but not CAS.574
