samples of eversion endarterectomy in which 1855 patients underwent 2244 CEAs using the eversion technique. In this study, 410 patients had 474 CEAs by the
standard technique. Operative mortality risk was 1% on
the eversion group vs 2.2% in the standard group and
incidence of perioperative stroke was 2.3% in standard
CEA vs 0.8% for ECEA. Risk of 60% or greater post-CEA
stenosis was 0.3% for ECEA vs 1.1% for standard CEA.
Schneider et al295 compared results with ECEA (2365) vs
CCEA (17,155) using data from the VQI and the MidAmerica Vascular Study Group. compared with eversion,
CCEA was more often performed with general anesthesia (92% vs 80%; P < .001) and with a shunt (59% vs
24%; P < .001). Perioperative ipsilateral neuro events
(ECEA, 1.3% vs CCEA, 1.2%; P ¼ .86) and any ipsilateral
stroke (ECEA, 0.8% vs CCEA, 0.9%; P ¼ .84) were similar
in the two groups. ECEA tended to take less time (median 99 minutes vs 114 minutes; P < .001). However,
ECEA was more like to require a return to the operating
room for bleeding (1.4% vs 0.8%; P ¼ .002). Estimated survival and freedom from stroke at 1 year were similar, but
the 1-year freedom from recurrent stenosis of greater
than 50% was lower for ECEA (89% vs 94%; P < .001).

The authors concluded that ECEA and CCEA appear to
yield similar outcomes.
