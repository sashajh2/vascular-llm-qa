We suggest deferring open aneurysm repair for at least 6
months after drug-eluting coronary stent placement or,
alternatively, performing EVAR with continuation of dual
antiplatelet therapy.

In patients with a drug-eluting coronary stent requiring open
aneurysm repair, we recommend discontinuation of P2Y12
platelet receptor inhibitor therapy 10 days preoperatively
with continuation of aspirin. The P2Y12 inhibitor should be
restarted as soon as possible after surgery. The relative risks
and beneÔ¨Åts of perioperative bleeding and stent thrombosis
should be discussed with the patient.

Perioperative medical management of coronary
artery disease. The initiation of beta blockade before
noncardiac surgery has been associated with an
increased risk of stroke and all-cause mortality.103-105
The use of an a2 agonist is no longer recommended to
prevent cardiac events, nor is that of calcium channel
blockers, such as diltiazem and verapamil, given their
potential to impair myocardial function in patients with
reduced left ventricular function. Continuation of ACE
inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers is based on
individual clinical circumstances.91
Aspirin reduces adverse cardiovascular events among
patients with coronary artery disease and can be
continued during the perioperative period.106 Both
warfarin and the new oral anticoagulants (nonvitamin K
antagonist oral anticoagulants) should be discontinued
at least 5 days and 2 days, respectively, before major surgery.107 The need for low-molecular-weight heparin as a
bridge depends on the indication for anticoagulation.
We suggest continuation of beta blocker therapy during the
perioperative period if it is part of an established medical
regimen.
