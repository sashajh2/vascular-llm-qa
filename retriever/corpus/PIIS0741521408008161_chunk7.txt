 corresponding estimates
were 2.5% and 13.1%. To prevent one major or fatal ipsilateral stroke, nine patients would have to undergo carotid
endarterectomy.10
Results from ECST were similarly supportive of endarterectomy in symptomatic patients with 70% to 99% stenosis. The 3-year risk of ipsilateral stroke was 2.8% in patients
randomized to endarterectomy and16.8% in those randomized to medical therapy alone. The 3-year risk of disabling
or fatal stroke, or surgical death was 6.0% for the surgical
group and 11.0% for the medically treated patients. Therefore, to prevent an ipsilateral stroke or the composite
outcome of disabling or fatal stroke or surgical death, 7 and
20 patients had to undergo endarterectomy, respectively.12
Carotid endarterectomy for nonhemispheric symptoms, vertebrobasilar symptoms, acute stroke, or for stroke
or TIA with internal carotid occlusion is not supported by
high quality evidence but rather by very low quality evidence (case series and unsystematic observations).14-17 In
these settings, and faced with paucity of evidence, surgeon’s complication rate and patient’s values and preferences play a major role in decision making.
The exclusion criteria for NASCET withheld endarterectomy from patients with life expectancy of less than 5 years and
patients with significant comorbid conditions (massive stroke,
liver, kidney or respiratory failure, or cancer). They also excluded patients over the age of 79, those who had a prior
ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy, and those in which angiographic visualization of both carotid arteries and intracranial
branches was not possible. The risk benefit balance in these
populations is, therefore, unclear and our recommendation
requires judicious and selective application. In fact, some
observational studies support the safety and efficacy of carotid
endarterectomy in some of these excluded groups.18,19 Case
by case decision-making, involvement of patients’ values and
preferences, as well as surgeons experience and surgical center
outcomes should be considered.

There are no data to suggest that carotid endarterectomy
is less effective than medical management in any cohort of
