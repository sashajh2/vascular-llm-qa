 is deﬁned as an open lesion between the
knee and the ankle joint that remains unhealed for at least
four weeks and occurs in the presence of venous disease.
Studies reviewed in this guideline included patients with
venous leg ulcers, irrespective of the method of diagnosis of
venous reﬂux.36

HEALTHCARE SYSTEM GUIDELINES: A pure venous ulcer is deﬁned, by professional
agreement, as a leg lesion, which has not healed within
a month (except in cases of recurrent ulcers when a diagnosis can be made in less than a month); with a pathophysiology due to ambulatory venous hypertension, which may
be secondary to: reﬂux in superﬁcial, perforating or deep
veins, and/or obstruction of the deep veins, and/or calf
muscle pump dysfunction; where there is no arterial
involvement.37

mixed ulcers often have a different rate of healing and
require additional treatment beyond the appropriate
venous measures for healing to occur and recurrence to
be prevented. The importance of these diagnoses is that
analysis of healing times and effectiveness of surgical
treatment of the venous component requires separation
of pure venous from mixed ulcers to learn whether treatment of the venous component contributes to faster ulcer
healing and early intervention is favored over delayed
treatment.

VENOUS ANATOMY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

d

For the purpose of this Guideline document, we
recommend the following deﬁnition of VLU: A venous
ulcer is an open skin lesion of the leg or foot that occurs
in an area affected by venous hypertension. Venous hypertension is the result of reﬂux or obstruction. This
may occur as a focal phenomenon in the distal extremity
or as a central mechanism, as in iliocaval obstruction or
elevated inferior vena cava pressure from advanced truncal
obesity. The mere existence of either reﬂux or obstruction
does not appear to be the full cause of venous ulcers, with
additional biochemical factors due to activation of the inﬂammatory cascade, which may act as the inciting factor
for appearance of the actual ulcer. Identiﬁcation of these
additional factors awaits further advances in the
