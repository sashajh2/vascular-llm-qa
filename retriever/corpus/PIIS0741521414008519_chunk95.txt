owmetry showed that
sustained compression with a pressure around 40 mm
Hg increases the arterial ﬂow under the bandage in
normal volunteers.308 Similarly, a recent study performed
in patients with VLUs and concomitant arterial occlusive
disease (ABI of 0.5 to 0.85) demonstrated by multiple
metrics that arterial blood ﬂow is even augmented by inelastic bandages.309
For patients with VLU and concomitant PAD, use of
standard compression has been shown to be safe if ABI
$0.80.303,310,311 Modiﬁed compression bandages or
compression stockings with lower pressure ratings can be
used for ankle systolic pressure $60 mm Hg, digital pressure $30 mm Hg or ABI $0.50 with close monitoring,
but only after consultation with a vascular specialist.309,312
Use of ankle perfusion pressure of 60 mm Hg or greater
rather than ABI #0.5 as a cutoff for compression is
preferred because this correlates better with tissue perfusion pressure, and any sustained external compression pressure should never exceed this cutoff perfusion pressure.
One study showed that modiﬁed compression multilayered
bandages with reduced compression pressure can be beneﬁcial for healing of mixed ulcers.311

Guideline 5.5: Intermittent Pneumatic Compression
We suggest use of intermittent pneumatic compression when other compression options are not available,
cannot be used, or have failed to aid in venous leg
ulcer healing after prolonged compression therapy.
[GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) was
initially proposed as a method to promote VLU healing
by activation of the ﬁbrinolytic system and showed promise in decreasing VLU healing time in patients who had
previously failed to respond to conservative treatment.313,314 However, this theory remains to be rigorously tested. To date, only 387 patients have been
enrolled in RCTs comparing IPC with other treatment
modalities.36 Whereas it is advantageous to use IPC
compared with no compression therapy, currently there
is limited evidence to suggest that the addition of IPC
