alateral carotid occlusion.
A Cochrane Review of the several randomized trials229-235 looking at anesthesia showed no evidence of
decreased perioperative strokes (2.7% for local

anesthesia vs 2.7% for general anesthesia; P ¼ .99). Use
of local anesthesia was also associated with a signiﬁcant
reduction in risk of 30-day perioperative local hemorrhage (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.12-0.77; Table III).
A more recent Cochrane Review by Vaniyapong et al236
reported results comparing local vs general anesthesia
for CEA from 14 RCTs, concluding that risk of stroke or
death within 30 days of surgery did not differ signiﬁcantly
between the two anesthetic techniques (Table III).
More recently, Hye et al237 reported on anesthesia technique and risk of MI after CEA in the CREST trial. Between
2000 and 2008, 1151 patients underwent CEA (anesthetic
type available for 1149 patients), and 1123 patients underwent CAS within 30 days of randomization in CREST.
CEA patients were categorized by anesthetic type
(regional anesthesia vs general anesthesia). The results
showed that CREST patients undergoing CEA with
regional anesthesia had a similar risk of periprocedural
MI as those undergoing CAS, whereas the risk for CEA
with general anesthesia was twice that of patients undergoing CAS.
Dakour Aridi et al238 used VQI data for 2003 to 2017 to
compare real-world outcomes of CEA under regional or
local anesthesia vs general anesthesia. A retrospective
analysis showed that compared with patients undergoing CEA with general anesthesia, the 6684 (9%) CEA
cases of 75,319 that were were performed under local
anesthesia/regional anesthesia were more likely to have
a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists class
(class 3-5, 94% vs 93%) and more likely to be older (median age, 72 years vs 71 years) (all P < .0
