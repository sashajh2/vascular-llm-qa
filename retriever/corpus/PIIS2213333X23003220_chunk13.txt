mentation or induration. Miniphlebectomy or limited stripping
is safe and effective if the saphenous vein is close to the skin (<0.5 cm).

5.2.7.

For patients with large (>10 mm), nonaneurysmal saphenous veins, thermal ablation with EVLA or RFA should be performed
rather than using nonthermal ablation techniques.

5.2.8. The incidence of superﬁcial thrombophlebitis has been reported to be similar for thermal and nonthermal ablations.
5.2.9.

In patients with uncomplicated C2 disease (no venous claudication, thigh swelling, suprapubic or abdominal wall
varicosities) due to concurrent superﬁcial incompetence and iliac or iliofemoral venous obstruction, treatment of superﬁcial
incompetence ﬁrst is indicated.

6.1.1.

For patients with the early stages of symptomatic varicose veins we suggest preserving the
GSV using the ambulatory selective variceal ablation under local anesthesia (ASVAL)
technique, if performed by a physician who is familiar with the strategy.

For patients with symptomatic varicose veins, we suggest preserving the GSV using the
ambulatory conservative hemodynamic correction of venous insufﬁciency (CHIVA)
technique, if performed by physician who is familiar with the strategy.
