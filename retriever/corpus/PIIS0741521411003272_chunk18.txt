58% of his patients with
advanced CVD, studied with phlebography, never had a
previous DVT.
Varicose veins and venous ulcers can be a great
financial burden to patients and to society. Varicose veins
and associated complications may lead to chronic pain,
disability, decreased quality of life (QOL), loss of working days, and early retirement. In the United States, the
direct medical cost of CVD has been estimated to be
between $150 million and $1 billion annually.3,4 In the
United Kingdom, 2% of the national health care budget
per year (US $1 billion) is spent on the management of
leg ulcers.1
Venous ulcer is an under-recognized and undertreated
disease. A recently published supplement of the Journal of
Vascular Surgery details the noble goal of the Pacific Vascular Symposium 6 (PVS6) to lead a call to action to
formulate a doable and achievable plan to reduce the incidence of venous ulcers in the United States by 50% in 10
years.64
ANATOMY
During the past decade, new venous terminology has
been developed and adopted by vascular societies around
the world.47,49,61 The success of assigning uniform names
to common veins was accompanied by new information on
anatomy obtained with duplex ultrasonography, threedimensional computed tomography (CT), and magnetic
resonance (MR) imaging; all these resulted in better understanding of the anatomy of veins and the pathology of
CVD.33,62
Superficial veins
Superficial veins of the lower limbs are those located
between the deep fascia, covering the muscles of the
limb, and the skin. The main superficial veins are the
GSV and the SSV. All previous names used to describe
these vessels (greater, long, lesser) should be abandoned.
The GSV originates from the medial superficial veins of
the dorsum of the foot and ascends in front of the medial
malleolus along the medial border of the tibia, next to
the saphenous nerve (Fig 1). There are posterior and
anterior accessory saphenous veins in the calf and the
thigh. The saphenofemoral
