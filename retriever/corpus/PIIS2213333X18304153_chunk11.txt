lation or stripping.
Taking the evidence as a whole, one might conclude
that some compression is better than none. The recommendation of this committee is as follows: When
possible, compression (elastic stockings or wraps) should
be used after surgical or thermal procedures to eliminate
varicose veins. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Five studies addressed the dosage and modality of
compression after saphenous vein ligation/stripping or
thermal ablation.12,13,23,25,28 Four of these, representing a
total of 237 patients, compared outcomes associated
with different compression modalities and doses after
various types of saphenous vein surgery.13,23,25,28 The ﬁfth
study compared outcomes using different compression
modalities after endovenous ablation in 200 patients.12
Four were randomized trials,12,13,23,25 whereas one was a
case-control study.28 In one of the randomized trials,
the authors clearly stated that treatment was blinded25;
in the others, this was not speciﬁed.
Compression was achieved using a variety of stockings
of different strengths, wraps, and “eccentric” foam pads
or “bulk dressings,” placed directly over the treated
saphenous vein sites. The compression pressures of the
different modalities were reported in three studies,13,25,28
partially reported in one,12 and not reported in another.23
Compression pressures ranged from a low of 18 mm Hg
with a single stocking to a high of almost 100 mm Hg
with a combination of two stockings and an eccentric
pad in the standing position.13 Outcomes reported

complications (hematoma, bleeding through the dressings, skin irritation, phlebitis, and deep venous thrombosis [DVT]), and quality of life. Pain was assessed in all
