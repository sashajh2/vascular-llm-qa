otid bifurcation disease. It may be best indicated in patients with short bifurcation lesions, those
with elongated ICAs (coils and kinks) and in cases with

high bifurcations. The most commonly-accepted technique is that the ICA is transected while removing the
bulk of the plaque from the CCA as the ICA is transected.
This is followed by everting the distal media or the
external elastic lamina and the adventitia around the
core of atherosclerotic plaque until the end point is
reached. Visualization of the end point is mandatory
and in about 25% of cases, the ICA can be shortened as
it is reanastomosed to the CCA.294,311-318
Multiple studies have documented the numerous advantages of this technique. These include no risk of prosthetic infection, less operative time and cerebral
ischemic clamp time than patched CEA, preservation
of the anatomic and hemodynamic geometry of the
ICA/CCA, and possibly a decreased risk of restenosis.319
Although early studies reported decreased restenosis
risk, in meta-analyses it has been shown to be equivalent
to traditional patch angioplasty, and both patched and
eversion endarterectomies are superior to primary arterial closure. Patients with small internal carotid arteries,
such as women, may beneﬁt from eversion or patched
endarterectomy.320 Disadvantages of this approach are
that it may be difﬁcult to evaluate the end point in extensive and long ICA disease. If shunting in ECEA is necessary,
shunts
are
usually
inserted
after
the
endarterectomy is performed. This technique can be
very useful in patients who have carotid kinks or coils
by shortening the ICA.
Several randomized trials compared conventional CEA
(CCEA) with eversion,311-317 and all provided Level 1 evidence conﬁrming the equivalence of ECEA and CCEA
with patching in regard to perioperative results. The
largest Level 1 study was a multicenter randomized trial
comparing CCEA and eversion came from the EVERsion
