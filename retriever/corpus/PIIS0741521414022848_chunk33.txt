 highintensity exercise in improving claudication parameters,
provided the duration of exercise is extended in the lowintensity group to achieve similar levels of exercise exposure.110 However, use claudication end points of nearly
maximal pain vs onset of pain does appear to produce
greater changes in distance to onset and maximal pain.108
Data supporting nearly maximal pain during exercise are
derived from time to maximal claudication pain achieved
with treadmill testing and may actually underestimate beneﬁts under the submaximal conditions more characteristic of
everyday community walking.111
The time length of exercise training sessions as well as
its frequency and duration are important in achieving
maximal beneﬁt with training sessions: >30 minutes per
session provides greater beneﬁt than sessions for
<30 minutes, scheduling more than three sessions per
week is more effective than <3 sessions per week, and program lengths of >26 weeks are more effective than
programs <26 weeks.108
Exercise programs can vary from completely unstructured programs based on patient instruction done on their
own accord to programs that are supervised and institutionally based. All exercise programs depend on patient compliance, so it is not surprising that structured, supervised
exercise programs demonstrate superior outcomes to unsupervised programs (home exercise programs) and are therefore the preferred strategy for exercise therapy when possible.
As previously stated, reimbursement for structured exercise programs in the United States is currently lacking,
making self-directed home programs an important alternative for many patients. Home exercise programs may be
able to be modiﬁed or supplemented to improve their
effectiveness. Patterson et al112 determined a 12-week
home-based exercise program supplemented with a lecture
program and weekly exercise instruction resulted in
improvement at 6 months in initial claudication time and
in maximal walking time. The improvements were statistically signiﬁcant compared with baseline values, although

not as great as those achieved with supervised exercise.
Mouser et al113 found that patients completing a homebased exercise program demonstrated improvement in
the initial claudication distance and absolute claudication
distances, although less than what would be expected in
a supervised program. Unfortunately, 47% of those not
completing the program dropped out by not returning
for their follow-up appointment.
