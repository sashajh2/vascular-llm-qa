of a spinal cord protection protocol in patients at high
risk of spinal cord injury because of extensive coverage
length (>15 cm), poor hypogastric perfusion (occluded
or signiﬁcantly stenosed hypogastric arteries), or
coverage of important collaterals (subclavian/hypogastric
arteries). Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 18: We recommend prophylactic cerebrospinal ﬂuid drainage for spinal cord injury protection in TEVAR cases that are deemed high risk
(covering extensive length of descending aorta; previous
aortic coverage, including endovascular aneurysm repair
and open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair; compromised pelvic perfusion with diseased or occluded common or internal iliac arteries; diseased or occluded
vertebral arteries; planned left subclavian artery [LSA]
coverage; or deemed high risk by the operating surgeon).
Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of
Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 19: For elective TEVAR of a TAA
where coverage of the LSA is necessary for adequate
stent graft seal, we suggest preoperative or concomitant
LSA revascularization. Level of recommendation: Grade
1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 20: For patients in whom the anatomy to be treated compromises perfusion to vital structures, we recommend LSA revascularization. Level of
recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of
Evidence: B (Moderate)
Examples of these circumstances include the following:
Presence of a patent left internal mammary artery to
coronary artery bypass graft
Termination of the left vertebral artery into the posterior
inferior cerebellar artery
Absent, atretic, or occluded right vertebral artery
Patent left arm arteriovenous shunt for dialysis
