Osm/kg).137
However, rates of CIN for iopamidol (Isovue-370, 796
mOsm/kg, nonionic) are similar to those for iodixanol,
which suggests that other physiochemical properties,
apart from osmolarity, are important determinants of
CIN.138 Likewise, several randomized trials of ionic
and nonionic contrast agents have demonstrated no
difference in CIN.139
In summary, minimizing the volume of any type of
contrast agent is essential to reducing the risk of CIN,
and all nephrotoxic drugs should be stopped at least
48 hours before administration of contrast material.
Patients at increased risk for CIN should be hydrated
before and after EVAR. Normal saline at 1 mL/kg/h can
be administered for 6 to 12 hours before and after the
procedure. Alternatively, 5% dextrose/sodium bicarbonate can be administered at 3 mL/kg/h for 1 hour before
EVAR and at 1 mL/kg/h for 6 hours afterward. Periprocedural N-acetylcysteine may be of beneﬁt to reduce CIN.
Additional strategies to limit contrast agent load include
use of carbon dioxide,140 intravascular or duplex ultrasound,141 and fusion imaging.142
We suggest holding ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor
antagonists on the morning of surgery and restarting these
agents after the procedure, once euvolemia has been
achieved.

Diabetes mellitus. Diabetic patients have increased
operative mortality after AAA repair, with reduced

survival 2 to 5 years after surgery, consistent with an
increased burden of cardiovascular disease.143 However,
