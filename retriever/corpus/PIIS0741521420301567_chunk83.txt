as survival is unrelated to operative technique in
repair of intact aneurysms, endovascular repair of
ruptured aneurysms is associated with both improved
overall survival and aneurysm-related survival compared
with open surgery.4,209

Recommendation

evidence

3.1

In patients with intact and ruptured aneurysms, we recommend coil embolization as
the treatment of choice.

1 (Strong)

B (Moderate)

3.2

In patients in whom coil embolization is not feasible, we suggest covered stenting or
stent-assisted coil embolization as a treatment option in select cases of GDAA and
PDAA.

2 (Weak)

C (Low)

3.3

In patients with appropriate anatomy, we suggest transcatheter embolization with
liquid embolic agents as a treatment option for both GDAA and PDAA.

2 (Weak)

C (Low)

3.4

In patients with suitable anatomy, we suggest ﬂow-diverting, multilayered stents as a
treatment option for GDAA and PDAA, although these have not been adequately
studied to be recommended as a primary treatment modality.

2 (Weak)

C (Low)

3.5

In patients with nonruptured aneurysms, we suggest open surgical reconstruction if
needed to preserve ﬂow.

2 (Weak)

B (Moderate)

3.6

In patients with concomitant stenosis or occlusion, we suggest celiac artery
reconstruction.

2 (Weak)

B (Moderate)

Coil embolization of GDAA and PDAA has recently
become the treatment of choice whether the aneurysm
is ruptured or not.4,190,195,209,211-213,216 Different catheter
conﬁgurations can be employed, but a triaxial system consisting of a sheath-guiding catheter, a 4F or 5F catheter,
and a microcatheter provides stable support through
tortuous vessels or in treating distal arterial beds as well
as rapid exchange of the microcatheter if necessary.1
