Pentoxifylline increased the proportion of ulcer healing
compared with placebo, although this finding was only
statistically significant (P ⫽ .046) when a secondary adjusted analysis was conducted. Pentoxifylline in an oral dose
of 400 mg three times daily is suggested to patients with
venous ulcers in addition to local care, compression garment, or intermittent compression pump (ICP) in the
venous guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP; GRADE 2B).136
Diosmin and hesperidin. The effect of a combination
of flavonoid drugs, diosmin, and hesperidin, in the form of
MPFF, in addition to compression therapy, was evaluated
on ulcer healing and symptoms of CVD in an RCT by

Guilhou et al.137 Although the overall effect of the drug
when combined with compression therapy, was weak,
among patients with ulcers measuring ⱕ10 cm, more ulcers
healed in the MPFF group than in the placebo group (32%
vs 13%; P ⫽ .028) with a shorter duration of healing (P ⫽
.037). Sensation of heavy leg was less in patients treated
with MPFF (P ⫽ .030).
A meta-analysis of five RCTs that included 723 patients
with venous ulcers was reported by Coleridge-Smith et
al.130 The study found that at 6 months, the chance of
healing an ulcer was 32% better in patients treated with
adjunctive MPFF than in those managed by conventional
therapy alone (relative risk reduction, 32%; 95% CI, 3%70%). These results confirm that venous ulcer healing is
accelerated by MPFF treatment. For patients with persistent venous ulcers, flavonoids, in the form of MPFF given
orally or sulodexide administered intramuscularly and then
orally, are suggested in the ACCP guidelines (GRADE
2B).136 The SVS/AVF Guideline Committee also suggests
that MPFF or pentoxifylline be used for patients with
venous ulcers as an
