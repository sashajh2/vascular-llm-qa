rm that CEA and CAS can be performed safely in carefully selected asymptomatic patients.
Similar to patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis,
concerns remain whether the latter data can be translated into “real-world” experience in asymptomatic patients. In a 2009 study of asymptomatic patients using
VQI data, transfemoral CAS was associated with a significantly higher risk of major complications compared
with CEA.221 The 30-day outcome analysis of CAS and
CEA in 2,818 patients revealed the combined risk of
death, stroke, or MI for 1450 CAS patients was 4.6% vs
1.97% for 1368 CEA patients. However, the recent VQI
report by Hicks et al showed transfemoral CAS was not
associated with a signiﬁcant difference in stroke and
death when compared with CEA among low-risk, propensity-matched patients (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.76-2.90;
P ¼ .24).200
Transcarotid artery revascularization. The 30-day incidence of stroke and death in 485 asymptomatic patients
from the ROADSTER 1 and 2 trials was 1% and the 30-day
incidence of any stroke was 0.6%. Although these early
results are promising, further studies are needed to determine if these results are robust in larger populations.177,178 A
recent study of VQI data compared propensity score
matched asymptomatic patients and showed no difference in stroke and death risk between TCAR and transfemoral CAS (1.0% vs 1.5%; absolute difference, 0.42%
[95% CI, 1.30% to 0.47%]; RR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.37 to1.39]; P ¼
.32).207 A more recent study propensity scored patients
from the VQI that had undergone either TCAR or CEA were
compared. Of this cohort 9435 were asymptomatic. There
was no difference in stroke and death between CEA and
TCAR (1
