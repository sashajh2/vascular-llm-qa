 determine the hemodynamic signiﬁcance of a recurrent stenosis.77
The management of patients with a recurrent stenosis
and recurrent symptoms consistent with CMI is similar
to the management of a symptomatic de novo lesion.
Patients should undergo a CTA to facilitate the intervention, if not already performed. An endovascular-ﬁrst
approach is recommended for both failing endovascular
and open revascularization with the speciﬁcs of the procedure contingent upon the extent of the lesion, the
presence of thrombus, and the details of the initial procedure. It is interesting that endovascular revascularization has evolved from a “bridge to open
revascularization” to actually a “bridge to further percutaneous procedures.”171 The endovascular options include
thrombomechanical lysis for acute thrombus, balloon
angioplasty alone for in-stent restenosis, and/or the
placement of a balloon-expandable covered stent within
a bare metal stent. Tallarita et al172 reported their outcomes for patients undergoing reintervention after
mesenteric artery and stenting. Among the 157 patients
treated initially, 57 (36%) developed recurrent stenosis
at a mean follow-up of 29 months with 24 patients
(42%) with recurrent stenoses developing recurrent
symptoms (CMI, 21; AMI, 3). Repeat endovascular treatment was possible in 26 (87%) and was associate with
low mortality (3%) and excellent symptom improvement
(92%), despite a moderate complication rate (27% access
site, embolization/bowel ischemia, congestive heart failure, stent thrombosis). Importantly, 43% of the areas of
restenosis corresponded with technical defects identiﬁed at the index procedure. Admittedly, this is only a single series, but it suggests that many of the recurrent
stenoses are really inadequately treated index lesions,
underscoring the importance of completion imaging
and an adequate initial technical result.
