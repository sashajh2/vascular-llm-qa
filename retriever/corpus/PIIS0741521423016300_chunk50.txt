In a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer, when the wound
deteriorates or fails to signiﬁcantly improve (e.g., a less than
50% reduction in wound area within four weeks) despite
appropriate infection and glucose control, wound care, and
ofﬂoading, reassess the vascular status and consult with a
vascular specialist regarding possible revascularisation.

presentation is predictive of healing at 12 weeks.106e109
This has been shown to be the case independent of
the ulcer size at baseline and supports review of treatment protocols where adequate wound reduction is
not being achieved in the four week timeframe. Presence of suspected CLTI or a DFU that is failing to
adequately heal despite best practice care requires
prompt consultation with a vascular specialist and
assessment of whether a revascularisation procedure is
indicated. There is no direct evidence supporting the
recommendation which is a pragmatic statement based
on indirect evidence and expert opinion. Given the risk of
poor outcomes when PAD is left untreated in a person
with a poorly healing ulcer, a Best Practice Statement
has been made.

Best Practice Statement

Rationale
Multiple factors may contribute to delayed or nonhealing of DFU, including presence of infection, wound
size and depth, elevated foot pressures at the wound
site, and inadequate wound care. A number of studies
have demonstrated that a reduction in percentage of
wound area of more than 50% by four weeks after

Recommendation 16
In a person with diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and a foot
ulcer or gangrene, avoid revascularisation when the risk
ebeneﬁt ratio for the probability of success of the intervention
is clearly unfavourable.

Rationale
Revascularisation should not be performed if there is
no realistic chance of wound healing, when major
amputation is inevitable, a functional foot is unlikely
to be achieved, or when life expectancy is short and
there is unlikely to be beneﬁt to the person. The
Writing Committee considered that in such persons
any revascularisation procedure is unlikely to be of
beneﬁt to the person and
