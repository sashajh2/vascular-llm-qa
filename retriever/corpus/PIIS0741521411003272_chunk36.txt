botic syndrome, thrombotic or
nonthrombotic iliac vein obstruction (May-Thurner syndrome), pelvic
congestion syndrome, nutcracker syndrome, vascular malformations,
venous trauma, tumors, and planned open or endovascular venous
interventions.

tests are not routinely performed. In those with recurrent
DVT, thrombosis at a young age, or thrombosis in an
unusual site, we recommend screening for thrombophilia.
Laboratory examination is also needed in patients with
long-standing recalcitrant venous ulcers. One study found
2.1% of venous and arterial ulcers had a secondary etiology,
including neoplasia, chronic inflammation, sickle cell disease, vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and hydroxyurea.103 Patients who undergo general
anesthesia for treatment of CVD may need a blood cell
count or an electrolyte panel.
CLASSIFICATION OF CVD
The cornerstone for management of CVD is the proper
diagnosis and accurate classification of the underlying venous problem, which create the base for correctly directed
treatment. The clinical and laboratory evaluation of the
patient with varicose veins or more advanced CVD should
be completed by establishing the clinical class of the disease.
The CEAP classification was developed by the AVF in 1994
and later revised in 2004.76,77 The classification is based on

clinical signs of venous disease (C), etiology (E), anatomy
(A), and the underlying pathophysiology (P).
Clinical class includes the full spectrum of venous disorders, from no signs of visible venous disease (C0) to
telangiectasia or reticular veins (C1), varicose veins (C2),
edema (C3), skin changes, such as pigmentation or eczema
(C4a) or lipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche (C4b),
and healed (C5) or active (C6) ulcer. The presence or
absence of symptoms is also recorded as S (symptomatic) or
A (asymptomatic).
Etiology can be congenital (Ec), primary (Ep), or secondary (Es).
The anatomic classification separates superficial ven
