 mixed with the sclerosing agent. The carbon
dioxide– based foam group had 128 patients (115 women
and 13 men). Visual disturbances were experienced by 3.1%
(4 of 128) of the carbon dioxide group and in 8.2% (4 of
49) of the air group (P ⫽ .15). The incidence of chest
tightness (3.1% vs 18%), dry cough (1.6% vs 16%), and
dizziness (3.1% vs 12%) was significantly lower in the
carbon dioxide group compared with the air group (P ⬍
.02). Nausea occurred in 2% of the carbon dioxide foam
group and in 4% of the air foam group (P ⫽ .53). Overall,
the proportion of patients describing adverse effects decreased from 39% (19 to 49) to 11% (14 to 128) as carbon
dioxide replaced air for foam preparation (P ⬍ .001). The
authors concluded that adverse effects decreased significantly if carbon dioxide rather than air was used to make the
sclerosing foam for chemical ablation of superficial veins of
the lower extremity.
Results. Short-term and midterm results of liquid
sclerotherapy have been good for both reticular and varicose veins, but durable success depends largely on the
presence or absence of axial reflux. Those with untreated
incompetent saphenous veins have the highest rate of recurrence.295,328 Kern et al329 reported results of liquid
sclerotherapy of telangiectasia and reticular veins in 96
patients. Those who wore elastic stockings for 3 weeks after
treatment had an early success rate of 76%. Goldman330
