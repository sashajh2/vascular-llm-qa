 ulcer healing is
accelerated by MPFF treatment. For patients with persistent venous ulcers, flavonoids, in the form of MPFF given
orally or sulodexide administered intramuscularly and then
orally, are suggested in the ACCP guidelines (GRADE
2B).136 The SVS/AVF Guideline Committee also suggests
that MPFF or pentoxifylline be used for patients with
venous ulcers as an adjuvant therapy to compression to
accelerate ulcer healing (GRADE 2B).
Compression treatment
Compression therapy is the basic and most frequently
used treatment of varicose veins, venous edema, skin
changes, and ulcerations. Compression is recommended to
decrease ambulatory venous hypertension to patients with
CVD in addition to lifestyle modifications that include
weight loss, exercise, and elevation of the legs during the
day whenever possible.
The different forms of ambulatory compression techniques and devices include elastic compression stockings,
paste gauze boots (Unna boot), multilayer elastic wraps,
dressings, elastic and nonelastic bandages, and nonelastic
garments. Pneumatic compression devices (such as an
ICP), applied primarily at night, are also used in patients
with refractory edema and venous ulcers.138 The rationale

We suggest venoactive drugs (diosmin, hesperidin, rutosides, sulodexide, micronized
purified flavonoid fraction, or horse chestnut seed extract [aescin]) for patients
with pain and swelling due to chronic venous disease, in countries where these
drugs are available.
We suggest using pentoxifylline or micronized purified flavonoid fraction, if
available, in combination with compression, to accelerate healing of venous ulcers.
