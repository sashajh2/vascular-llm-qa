We recommend repair of all SMAAs and pseudoaneurysms as soon as the
diagnosis is made regardless of size.

We suggest careful observation of SMAA because of dissection unless refractory
symptoms develop.

SMAA represents 3.5% to 8% of visceral artery aneurysm
cases,1,98 and autopsy results suggest that these aneurysms constitute 1 in every 12,000 to 19,000 autopsies.169
Although the etiology of these aneurysms is diverse,
SMAA most commonly results from an infectious cause
or dissection,166 with the superior mesenteric artery the
most common site of infection outside of the aorta.166
The most common reason for mycotic aneurysm of the
superior mesenteric artery is subacute bacterial

same time, the overall mortality from elective repair of
SMAA is <15%,171 and the mortality is even better when
endovascular procedures are used for elective SMAA
repair.1 Given the signiﬁcant incidence of rupture and
the high mortality after repair of ruptured SMAA, once
SMAAs are diagnosed, they should be treated.
Inferior mesenteric artery aneurysms are rare and are
sparsely reported in the literature172-174; they have been
described in patients with collagen vascular disease or

guidelines were generated, and the management of
those patients should be individualized.
Some authors have pointed to the possible association
of dissection and aneurysmal degeneration of the
dissected artery.175 Yun et al168 classiﬁed these isolated
dissections into three groups based on angi
