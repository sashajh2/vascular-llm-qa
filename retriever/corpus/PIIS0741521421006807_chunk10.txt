Retrospective study

Recommendation 4: For asymptomatic patients with a life expectancy of $5 years, we suggest open PAA repair, provided that an adequate
saphenous vein is present; for patients with a diminished life expectancy, if intervention is indicated, endovascular repair should be
considered (grade 2C)
