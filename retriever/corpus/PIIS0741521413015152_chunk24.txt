 acute limb ischemia; acute “trash” foot; or
ischemia due to emboli, acute trauma/mangled extremity;

and those with wounds related to nonatherosclerotic conditions such as vasculitis, collagen vascular disease, Buerger’s
disease, neoplasm, dermatoses, and radiation.
The target population for this system includes any
patient with:
Ischemic rest pain, typically in the forefoot with conﬁrmatory, objective hemodynamic studies (ABI <0.40,
AP <50, TP <30, TcPO2 <20)
d A diabetic foot ulcer
d Nonhealing lower limb or foot ulceration of at least
2 weeks duration
d Gangrene involving any portion of the foot or lower
limb.
d

Since each of the three categories (wound, ischemia,
and foot infection) has four grades of severity, the system

Table III. Deﬁnition of terms
I. Components: The Society for Vascular Surgery Lower Extremity Threatened Limb (SVS WIfI) classiﬁcation system has three
components:
Wound
Ischemia
Foot Infection
II. Grades: Each component is graded on a spectrum from 0 (none) to 1 (mild) to 2 (moderate) to 3 (severe) according to the criteria
outlined in Table II.
III. Classes: Based on grades assigned to each of the three individual components, a WIfI class is assigned.
Example 1: A patient with ischemic rest pain, an ABI of 0.30, no wound, and no signs of infection would be classiﬁed as Wound 0 Ischemia
3 foot Infection 0 or WIfI 030.
Example 2: A 55-year-old man with diabetes, dry gangrene of two toes, and a <2-cm rim of cellulitis at the base of the toes, but without
systemic or metabolic toxicity has absent pedal pulses. The ABI is 1.5. The toe pressure is 35 mm Hg. He would be classiﬁed as Wound 2
Ischemia 2 foot Infection 1
