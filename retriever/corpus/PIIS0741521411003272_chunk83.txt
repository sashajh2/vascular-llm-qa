The use of RF for saphenous ablation was approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999,
and the first reports were published in 2000.251-253 Experience with RF rapidly accumulated,8,195,246,254-259 although the first-generation device was somewhat cumbersome to use. The current ClosureFast RF catheter (VNUS
Medical Technologies, San Jose, Calif), introduced in
2007, is more user-friendly, and treatment with it is faster
than with the first-generation device.260 This rendition
does not need an irrigation system, and the entire pullback

procedure takes 3 to 4 minutes. A second RFA system for
bipolar RF-induced thermotherapy, Celon RFITT, is now
available in Europe (Olympus Medical Systems, Hamburg,
Germany).261 This system generates heat at 60°C to 85°C
and operates with a continuous pullback technique at a
pullback speed of 1 cm/s. Clinical studies to investigate the
efficacy of this device are under way.
Patient selection. To select the right patient for endovenous thermal ablation, thorough preprocedural duplex ultrasonography must be performed. The identifica-

tion of all refluxing venous segments and their ablation
during the procedure is the key to minimizing recurrence of
varicose veins. Inappropriate vein size (⬍2 mm and ⬎15
mm for RFA), a history of superficial thrombophlebitis
resulting in a partially obstructed saphenous vein, and the
uncommon occurrence of a tortuous GSV on duplex examination are potential contraindications. Patients with ropy
varicose veins located immediately under the skin or those
with aneurysmal dilations of the SFJ are probably better
served with conventional high ligation, division, and stripping. Those with extensive deep venous occlusion should
undergo superficial ablation selectively, because superficial
veins in these patients may be important for venous outflow
