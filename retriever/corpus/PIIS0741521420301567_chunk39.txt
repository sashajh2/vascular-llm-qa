 deﬁned because of their overall scarcity. However,
it is clear even from the numerous case series in the literature that a signiﬁcant proportion of visceral artery aneurysms present with rupture; therefore, a relatively
aggressive approach to their diagnosis and management
certainly seems warranted. The overall mortality of
ruptured SAAs is as high as 25%.87
SAAs in young women are thought to have a particular
tendency toward rupture, especially during the third
trimester of pregnancy.88 Pregnancy may be associated
with 20% to 50% of all ruptures.89 Rupture of an SAA
during pregnancy has devastating maternal and fetal
mortality rates of 80% and 90%, respectively.90,91
Depending on the entirety of vessel wall involvement,
SAAs can be subdivided into true aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms.
Splenic
artery
pseudoaneurysms
certainly have a higher rupture potential than true aneurysms. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that
pseudoaneurysms display relatively rapid growth rates,
implicating a focus on early intervention regardless of
size. In the series by Tulsyan et al,1 in which 48 visceral
aneurysms were treated, 80% of 28 pseudoaneurysms
were symptomatic at presentation as opposed to
30% of 20 true aneurysms. Pitton et al92 reported a review of 233 patients with 253 visceral artery aneurysms.
The rate of rupture at presentation was noted to be
signiﬁcantly higher in visceral pseudoaneurysms than
in true aneurysms (76.3% vs 3.1%). There were 35 ruptures in their series. There was no signiﬁcant difference
in size between ruptured and nonruptured visceral aneurysms. The authors concluded that visceral

Nevertheless, several large case series of SAA management have included an observation cohort with acceptable results.93-95 General guidelines state that true
SAAs <3 cm, asymptomatic, and showing little or no
growth can be safely observed and monitored with serial
imaging studies. As indicated before, splenic artery pseudoaneurysms
