or stroke in CAS patients was 3.7% (3.5%-4%), but no
trend was observed for annual volume (P ¼ .304). Riskadjusted analysis conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant inverse relationship between hospital volume and risk of stroke or death
after CEA but not CAS.574
Using administrative claims databases, Hussain et al575
reported on the association between operator specialty
and outcome after carotid artery revascularization in a
population-based, observational cohort study of all patients who underwent CEA or CAS in Ontario, Canada,
between 2002 and 2015. In this report, 16,544 patients
were analyzed (14,301 CEA and 2243 CAS). Vascular surgeons performed a majority of CEA (56%) followed by
neurosurgeons (21%), general surgeons (15%), cardiac surgeons (8%), radiologists (82.5%), and neurosurgeons
(17.5%) performed CAS. In the CEA group, risk of stroke
or death was higher among patients treated by nonvascular surgeons (4%) compared with vascular surgeons
(2.9%; adjusted OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.6; P ¼ .008) but risk
of death was similar in the two groups. The 30-day risk
of stroke or death was higher in CEA patients treated
by neurosurgeons (4.1%; adjusted OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.001.6) and cardiac surgeons (4.4%; adjusted OR, 1.5; 95%
CI, 1.0-2.3) compared with vascular surgeons (2.9%). Patients who underwent CAS by radiologists and neurosurgeons experienced similar 30-day stroke or death risk
(8% vs 7.9%, respectively; adjusted OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.71.7; P ¼ .79).575
