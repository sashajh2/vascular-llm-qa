(91.7%) compared with 9 of 24 control
limbs (37.5%) that remained
asymptomatic (P < .05)

Retrospective study

Galland et al,29
2005

Consecutive patients with
symptomatic or
asymptomatic PAA

Variable

116 PAAs in 73 patients, 39 (34%) with
acute ischemia; size and distortion
were greater in PAAs presenting with
acute ischemia than in
asymptomatic PAAs (P < .01); degree
of distortion differentiated
symptomatic from asymptomatic
PAAs (P ¼ .0066); size was not
signiﬁcantly different between these
2 groups; for PAA $3 cm in diameter
with $45 distortion, sensitivity,
speciﬁcity, and positive and negative
predictive values for thrombosis were
90%, 89%, 83%, and 94%, respectively

Prospective study

Recommendation 3: We suggest that for patients with a PAA <20 mm, in the presence of thrombus and clinical suspicion of embolism or
imaging evidence of poor distal runoff, repair should be considered to prevent thromboembolic complications and possible limb loss
(grade 2C)
Ascher et al,30

34 PAAs in 25 patients; 14
(41%) had no symptoms
(group 1) and 20 (59%) had
symptoms (group 2)

PAA diameter averaged 2.8 6 0.7 cm
(range, 1.8-4.5 cm) in group 1 and
2.2 6 0.8 cm (range, 1.3-4.0 cm) in
group 2 (P < .03); PAA thrombosis
was present in 7 of 20 limbs in group
2; 4 of these patients had ipsilateral
SFA thrombosis; evaluation of
infrapopliteal arteries in group 1
