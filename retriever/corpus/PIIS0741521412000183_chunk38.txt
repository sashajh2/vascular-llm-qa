 of the current best
evidence in making decisions about the care of individual
patients.”101 This specifically involves integrating clinical expertise, the patient’s individual situation and preferences, and
the best available clinical evidence. The guidelines of the
Society for Vascular Surgery and American Venous Forum
should be interpreted as a guide to be applied in the context of
clinical judgment rather than as a rigid mandate. Furthermore,
there are many aspects of early thrombus removal strategies
for which little rigorous data exist and evidence-based guidelines are impractical at the present time. Clinical judgment is of
the utmost importance in such situations.
CONCLUSIONS
Unfortunately, the clinical evidence supporting virtually all strategies of early thrombus removal, including

catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, and surgical thrombectomy,
is of low quality. Large multicenter randomized clinical
trials are lacking, and existing series have often included
diverse patients and have largely evaluated only technical
outcome measures.16,17,74 Despite these obvious deficiencies, systematic review of studies comparing these
strategies with conventional anticoagulation does suggest some benefit with respect to reducing the incidence
of the postthrombotic syndrome.19 Successful application of any of these strategies requires careful patient
selection as well as a consideration of the patient’s underlying values and preferences. Accordingly, most recommendations are weak (Grade 2). Furthermore, because of the very low quality of the underlying evidence,
the details of these recommendations are likely to change
as better-quality evidence becomes available. In this
regard, the use of patient-important outcomes, such as
quality of life or objective measures of the post-thrombotic syndrome (Villalta score,102 Venous Clinical Severity Score103) should be strongly encouraged over technical outcomes such as lytic success and surrogate
markers such as reflux and residual venous obstruction.
