 an audible bruit in the neck may be an
appropriate indication for carotid imaging in selected
neurologically asymptomatic patients. Among patients
with a neck bruit, the prevalence of carotid stenosis of
more than 75% is 1.2%.30 However, the presence of a
neck bruit did not predict carotid stenosis of more than
60% in an asymptomatic patient population.30 These observations contrast to those in symptomatic patients, in
whom an ipsilateral bruit had a sensitivity of 63% and
speciﬁcity of 61% for high-grade carotid stenosis (70%99%).31 The presence of a bruit clearly increases the risk
of MI and cardiovascular death.32 However, in
population-based studies, the prevalence of severe stenosis is not high enough to make a bruit alone an indication
for screening. Thus, screening for a bruit alone should not
be done unless patients have other stenosis risk factors.3
It is reasonable to image the carotid bifurcation in patients with evidence of cerebral infarction on brain imaging, even without a relevant clinical history of stroke.
Although these patients may not be “symptomatic” as
deﬁned in the NASCET trial (hemispheric TIA, monocular
blindness or a nondisabling stroke within the previous
120 days),33 prior silent cerebral infarction in the carotid territory noted on brain imaging studies may be considered a
correlate of carotid territory neurologic symptoms.34 Additionally, the ﬁnding of Hollenhorst plaque on fundoscopic
examination of the retina is also correlated with presence
of signiﬁcant carotid bifurcation disease, and may therefore
also warrant carotid artery evaluation.3,35,36 Additional information regarding possible high-risk populations of neurologically asymptomatic patients who may be appropriate
for screening is discussed elsewhere in this section.

The most important features of imaging of carotid
