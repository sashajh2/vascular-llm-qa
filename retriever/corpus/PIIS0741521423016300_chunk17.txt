INTRODUCTION
The incidence of diabetes continues to increase in all
countries. Recent estimates are that 537 million people
are affected by diabetes (1 in 11 adults worldwide) and that
783 million individuals will be affected by 2045.25 Diabetes
is associated with signiﬁcant risk of foot complications
including ulceration, gangrene, and amputation. Development of diabetes related foot ulceration (DFU) precedes
up to 85% of non-traumatic amputations, with an annual
incidence of ulceration of approximately 2% and lifetime
incidence of DFU up to 34%.26 Diabetes related complications in the lower limb, including peripheral neuropathy
and PAD, typically precede the development of DFU.27
Collectively, these complications are a leading global cause
of disability, hospitalisation, and amputation, with a high
mortality rate following amputation.28

Diabetes is a signiﬁcant risk factor for development of
PAD. In a recent systematic review, Stoberock et al.29 found
that the prevalence of PAD was 10 e 26% in the general
adult population and 20 e 28% in those with diabetes. In
those with DFU, the prevalence of PAD was 50%, which is
consistent with the ﬁndings of the multicentre Eurodiale
study.29,30 PAD in people with diabetes is characterised by
a disease pattern that is frequently multisegmental and
bilateral with impaired collateral formation, often long
segment tibial artery occlusions, and is more distally distributed in the lower limb including frequent presentation of
infragenicular arterial occlusive disease, with an increased
risk of amputation.31e33 The diagnosis of PAD and chronic
limb threatening ischaemia (CLTI) is frequently complicated by the absence of classical symptoms of PAD such
as intermittent claudication and rest pain, probably due
to factors such as sedentary lifestyle and loss of pain sensation due to diabetes related peripheral neuropathy, which
is present in the majority
