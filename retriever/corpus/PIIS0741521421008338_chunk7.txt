). There was no statistically signiﬁcant
difference in primary patency at 3 years, secondary patency,
mortality, or the amputation rate. The open approach was
associated with lower embolic and thrombotic occlusions
at 30 days (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.24, 0.68). Forest plots are in
Supplementary Figs 1 and 2 (online only).
Data from the systematic reviews identiﬁed in the
search have shown that OAR was associated with lower
reintervention rate (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.17-0.45) more
wound complications (OR, 5.18; 95% CI, 2.19-12.26), and
longer length of stay, standardized mean difference of
2.16 (95% CI, 1.23-3.09).43
Studies of natural history. Studies of natural history
suggested that complications of popliteal aneurysms
develop at a mean observation time of 18 months.1 The
incidence of thromboembolic complications ranged
from 8% TO 100% across series and that in patients with
complications, amputation rate was 25%.1 In one series
with a longer follow-up, only 53% of patients treated
conservatively were free of complications at 5 years.35 In a
second case series, 36% of asymptomatic patients had
complications at 26 months.21
Certainty in estimates and publication bias. The risk of
bias was in general high across studies owing to a lack of
adjustment for prognostic risk factors. The certainty in
the comparative estimates was low owing to the observational nature of the studies and the small sample sizes.
Although we were unable to evaluate statistically for
publication bias, this type of bias is likely present in a
body of evidence that consists of smaller series that do
not require registration. It is plausible that published
results are more favorable than unpublished ones.

DISCUSSION
Main ﬁndings. We conducted a systematic review and
meta-analysis to support the Society for Vascular Surgery guideline on the management
