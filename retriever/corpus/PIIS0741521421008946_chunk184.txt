 in late ipsilateral stroke is small. The
2% to 3% stroke risk of reintervention (CEA or CAS)460,599
needs to be considered in the cost of any surveillance
protocol, given that the annual risk of ipsilateral (nonprocedure-related) stroke is only about 1% to 2%.600
A cost-effectiveness analysis of post-CEA ultrasound examination surveillance estimated total hospital charges
of $1,408,320 with a reimbursement of $702,400 for 489
CEAs followed up at 24 hours, 1, 6, and 12 months, and
annually thereafter. This surveillance protocol detected
only four patients with a greater than 80% restenosis,
raising concerns about overuse of surveillance ultrasound
assessments. The authors challenged the need for surveillance as not cost-effective and suggested decision
making based on severity of the contralateral carotid.596
Surveillance for contralateral carotid disease
Contralateral carotid disease progression after CEA and
its clinical signiﬁcance have been controversial in terms
of the need and frequency of surveillance as well as the
need for prophylactic surgical management among
asymptomatic patients.590,593,601-604
Irrespective of baseline contralateral ICA stenosis, by
2 years, 5% to 15% of patients will progress by one duplex
deﬁned categorical range (from <50% to 50%-69% or
from 50%-69% to >70%).590,593,603,605,606 More important
than the progression itself is the associated risk of stroke
with higher grades of stenosis. Many studies have
conﬁrmed associations between disease progression
and stroke. However, the low overall risk, partly related to
the protective role of the index CEA and partly to optimization of medical treatment, challenge the need for carotid intervention in patients with asymptomatic carotid
stenosis with prior contralateral CEA.590,593,602,603,605,606
