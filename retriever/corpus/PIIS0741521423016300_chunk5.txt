 a transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) measurement or a skin perfusion
pressure (SPP) to assess likelihood of healing.
A TcPO2 $ 25 mmHg increases the pre-test probability of healing
by up to 45% and value < 25 mmHg increases the pre-test probability of major amputation by approximately 20%. An SPP $ 40
mmHg increases the pre-test probability of healing by up to 30%.

Recommendation

9. In a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene, it is
suggested that the presence of peripheral artery disease and
other causes of poor healing should always be assessed. Diabetes
related micro-angiopathy should not be considered the primary
cause of foot ulceration, gangrene, or poor wound healing
without excluding other causes.

10. In a person with diabetes, peripheral artery disease and a foot
ulcer or gangrene, consider using the Wound/Ischaemia/foot
Infection (WIfI) classiﬁcation system to estimate healing
likelihood and amputation risk.
Treatment

11. In a person with diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and a foot ulcer
or gangrene who is being considered for revascularisation, evaluate
the entire lower extremity arterial circulation (from aorta to foot)
with detailed visualisation of the below knee and pedal arteries.

Best Practice Statement

12. In a person with diabetes, peripheral artery disease, a foot ulcer, and
clinical ﬁndings of ischaemia, a revascularisation procedure should
be considered. Findings of ischaemia include absent pulses, monophasic or absent pedal Doppler waveforms, ankle pressure < 100
mmHg or toe pressure < 60 mmHg. Consult a vascular specialist
unless major amputation is considered medically urgent.
