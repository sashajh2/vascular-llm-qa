56,87 Clinical data on
the efficacy of perforator ablations were obtained primarily
by using the SEPS procedure, but ultrasonographically
guided sclerotherapy or thermal ablations, when performed
with similar low complication rates, can be suggested as
alternative therapy for perforator treatment (GRADE 2C).
Pelvic varicosity and pelvic congestion syndrome
Valvular incompetence and retrograde flow to the ovarian veins and/or the internal iliac vein and its tributaries
may give rise to pelvic congestion syndrome and pelvic
varicosities, which may occur alone or together. Pelvic
congestion syndrome is associated with symptoms of pelvic
pain or heaviness, dyspareunia, and dysuria. Varicose veins
in the vulvar and perivulvar area are most often secondary to
previous pregnancy and are often associated with perimenstrual symptoms.
Evaluation. The appearance of varices in the region of
the pubis, labia, perineum, or buttocks suggests a pelvic
source of reflux. Several noninvasive diagnostic tests are
available, including lower extremity, transabdominal, and
transvaginal ultrasonography as well as CT and MR venography.372 All have been reported to be useful in documenting pelvic venous reflux, although the selection of the most
appropriate test largely depends on local institutional expertise. An ovarian vein diameter of â¬Ž6 mm on ultrasonography has been reported to have a 96% positive-predictive
