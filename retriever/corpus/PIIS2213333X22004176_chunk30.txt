 be used as an absolute
reference for venous reﬂux.

A high level of evidence on treatment decisions made using the vein diameter alone, however, is still lacking.
Analyzing the data from 242 patients who had participated
in a RCT, Attaran et al68 recently reported a poor correlation
between the GSV diameter and baseline VCSS (R ¼ 0.004;
P ¼ .95) and between the GSV diameter and VCSS improvement for #36 months of follow-up (R ¼ 0.04; P ¼ .55). Gibson
et al,69 in a study of 91 patients, also found a weak correlation between an increasing GSV diameter and VCSS and
no correlation between the GSV diameter and QoL scores,
including the CIVIQ (chronic venous insufﬁciency QoL
questionnaire) and VEINES for QoL and symptoms. These
investigators concluded that using the GSV diameter as
the sole criterion for determining the medical necessity
for treatment of GSV reﬂux is inappropriate.69 To establish
the minimal value for the diameter of incompetent superﬁcial truncal veins that could be used as a criterion for ablation, it is important to collect more data from patients for
whom DU was performed with the leg in the dependent
position, measured in the GSV at the proximal third of the
thigh.
Guideline 1.4.
We recommend the use of the 2020 upgraded CEAP
classiﬁcation of chronic venous disorders. The clinical
or basic CEAP classiﬁcation can be used for clinical
practice, and the full CEAP classiﬁcation system
should be used for clinical research.
Level of recommendation: ungraded good practice
statement
Rationale and evidence. Evaluation of the patients
should include documentation of the clinical class of
the chronic venous disorder. The panel recommends using the recently updated 2020 CEAP classiﬁcation system and reporting standards as a good practice
statement (Table II).15 Each clinical class (C0-C6) can be
further characterized with a subscript letter, according to
the presence or absence of symptoms (S, symptomatic;
A, asymptomatic; eg, C2A or C2S). Symptoms
