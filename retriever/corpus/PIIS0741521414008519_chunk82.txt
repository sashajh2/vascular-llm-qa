not sufﬁciently strong to justify their use as primary therapy
without an attempt at lower cost, evidence-based methods.
However, failure to demonstrate improvement after 4 weeks
of treatment with a decrease in wound size of at least 30% to
40% should lead the clinician to consider adjunctive treatment options.109 Re-evaluation of the patient and wound
should be performed before the use of adjuvant therapies
to ensure that compression has achieved edema control, bioburden is well controlled, and exudate is not excessive.
Guideline 4.19: Split-thickness Skin Grafting
We suggest against split-thickness skin grafting as
primary therapy in treatment of venous leg ulcers.
[GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B] We suggest
split-thickness skin grafting with continued compression for selected large venous leg ulcers that have failed
to show signs of healing with standard care for 4 to 6
weeks. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]

There is currently insufﬁcient information to recommend use of autologous skin grafting as a primary therapy
for VLUs. Studies have bias, small sample size, and indirect
comparators. A Cochrane review on skin grafting for VLUs
also failed to reach a deﬁnitive recommendation.255 A
recent RCT found that use of low-molecular-weight heparin resulted in decreased recurrence compared with skin
grafting without anticoagulation.256,257 After skin grafting,
patients should continue to use therapeutic compression.
Individual situations and patient preferences might
result in the use of skin grafting for VLUs. Some clinicians
consider skin grafting after standard of care has failed, for
large soft tissue defects, by the patient’s or clinician’s preference, and when there are speciﬁc reasons that require
more expeditious closure. In a nonrandomized study of
111 patients, Jankunas demonstrated improved healing
and durability with skin grafting compared with conservative therapy for large venous wounds that were present
longer than 6 months,, but only 65% of cases were judged
to have good take of the split-thickness skin graft.258 Skin
