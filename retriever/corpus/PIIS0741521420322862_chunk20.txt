when catheter-based arteriography was the primary
diagnostic imaging modality.
Because there is no reliable functional test for the diagnosis of CMI, the diagnosis must rely on the appropriate
clinical scenario and the presence of MAOD. Harki et al46
have attempted to develop a predictive model based on
the clinical presentation and anatomic ﬁndings to increase the diagnostic accuracy. They identiﬁed female
sex, weight loss, presence of cardiovascular disease, duration of symptoms, and the presence of SMA/CA stenosis
as diagnostic predictors. Van Dijk et al47 have recently
prospectively validated the predictive model (n ¼ 666)
and found that it discriminated well with the addition
of a predictor for the cause of the CA stenosis. Notably,
94% of the high-risk patients had CMI based on durable
symptom relief after revascularization, although the
diagnosis was conﬁrmed in only 8% of the low-risk
patients.
Mesenteric DUS examination is an excellent screening
tool for patients suspected of having CMI.48 Although
the test is technically demanding and requires an
advanced skill set, it can yield consistent, reproducible results in experienced hands. Patients are routinely fasted
for 6 to 8 hours to minimize the amount of bowel gas.
Nevertheless, obesity can complicate the examination
owing to the depth of the vessels. Comparison of mesenteric DUS ﬁndings with catheter-based arteriography

demonstrated that the CA and SMA were visualized 83%
and 93%, respectively, with ultrasound examination and
virtually 100% of the time with arteriography.49 The common DUS criteria for a SMA stenosis of 70% or greater is a
peak systolic velocity (PSV) of 275 cm/s or more, whereas
200 cm/s or more indicates a similar stenosis of the CA
with no ﬂow in either vessel consistent with an occlusion.
These criteria for the SMA were associated with a sensitivity of 92%, speciﬁcity of 96%, positive predictive value
(PPV) of 8
