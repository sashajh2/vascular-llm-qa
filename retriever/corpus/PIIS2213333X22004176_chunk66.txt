ities have a large number of perforating
veins, and their common locations have been identiﬁed
in elegant anatomic dissections.198,199 When perforating
veins are identiﬁed during the evaluation of varicose
veins, they will often be competent and functioning
normally. However, IPVs can also be identiﬁed in the

thigh and calf when a complete lower extremity venous
study is performed as a part of the initial evaluation
(Fig 3). Incompetent thigh perforator veins adjacent, or
connected, to incompetent saphenous veins are especially easy to identify, owing to their proximity to the
thigh truncal veins. Also, these perforator veins can occasionally be the single connection between an incompetent truncal thigh vein and the deep venous system,
functioning in a role similar to that of the SFJ.
When a venous DU examination identiﬁes an incompetent thigh or calf perforator vein, in conjunction with
incompetent truncal and/or tributary veins, in patients
with symptomatic CEAP class C2 disease, a decision is
required how to proceed. The question is whether it
would be better to perform ablation of the superﬁcial
truncal vein alone and treat the perforator vein later, if
needed, as a staged procedure. Previous guidelines
have recommended a combined procedure for patients
with more advanced chronic venous insufﬁciency.20,38
Evidence. The systematic review of Farah et al19 included
two RCTs with an intermediate risk of bias to deﬁne the role
of perforator ablation in patients with varicose vein CEAP
class C2 disease (Table IV).200,201 The ﬁrst RCT by Kianifard
et al200 had included patients with primary great saphenous varicose veins and IPVs who had undergone either
standard surgery (high ligation and saphenous stripping
and phlebectomy) or standard surgery combined with
subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS). Of the 72
randomized patients, 38 had undergone SEPS (71% with C2
disease) and 32 had not (75% with C2 disease). At
