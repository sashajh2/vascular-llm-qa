disease due to calf muscle pump dysfunction, but no reflux
or obstruction was noted on duplex scanning. Air plethysmography remains one of the few noninvasive techniques

“best practice” in the evaluation of patients with advance
CVD if duplex scanning does not provide definitive diagnosis on pathophysiology (CEAP C3-C6).
