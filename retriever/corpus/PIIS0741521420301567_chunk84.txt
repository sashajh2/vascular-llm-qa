conﬁgurations can be employed, but a triaxial system consisting of a sheath-guiding catheter, a 4F or 5F catheter,
and a microcatheter provides stable support through
tortuous vessels or in treating distal arterial beds as well
as rapid exchange of the microcatheter if necessary.1
Although it is not imperative, exclusion of all inﬂow and
outﬂow vessels is necessary to reduce the risk of recurrent
sac pressurization from antegrade or retrograde perfusion.6 End-organ perfusion is typically maintained by the
dense collateral network of these vessels, but isolated
coil packing of the aneurysm sac alone can be sufﬁcient
if the inﬂow vessel is vital for organ perfusion.217 Immediate
technical success rates are >90%.

Covered stenting may be performed when the artery
proximal and distal to the aneurysm is of suitable diameter with a low degree of tortuosity.212 Successful covered
stenting with a Viabahn stent (W. L. Gore & Associates,
Flagstaff, Ariz)220 as well as with an Advanta V12 stent
graft (Atrium Medical, Hudson, NH)221 has been reported.
Advantages of this technique include preservation of
ﬂow through the artery; however, it may be limited by
the discrepancy in arterial seal zone diameters as well
as by the ability to pass the stent through tortuous
anatomy.216
The liquid embolic agent n-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate
(NBCA) has been used to treat cases of both ruptured
and unruptured GDAA and PDAA.222 A theoretical
advantage of embolization with liquid embolic agents
is the ability to embolize small, tortuous vessels that
