 to use anticoagulation therapy instead of
antiplatelet therapy, extrapolating from the favorable
data for prosthetic graft patency with anticoagulation
therapy. However, a large analysis of meta-analyses
and randomized controlled trials concluded that the
best prophylaxis for vein bypass is anticoagulant therapy and, for prosthetic grafts, dual antiplatelet therapy.66-68
Recommendation 7: We suggest that patients with an
asymptomatic PAA who are not offered repair should
be monitored annually for changes in symptoms, pulse
examination, extent of thrombus, patency of the
outï¬‚ow arteries, and aneurysm diameter (grade 2C).
Patients with PAAs require a rigorous surveillance protocol with DUS because the risk of complications increases with time.49,50 Dawson et al20 observed in a set

of 42 patients with asymptomatic PAAs that 24% had
developed complications within 1 year and 68% had
developed complications within 5 years. In another
report, Dawson et al1 reported complications had
occurred at a mean 18 months, and the amputation
rate for patients with complications was 25%. Even
aneurysms <20 mm in diameter have been shown to
cause complications, as shown by Ascher et al.30 PAAs,
like most aneurysms, can result in complications that
result in limb loss if a high index of suspicion is not
used with serial surveillance.
