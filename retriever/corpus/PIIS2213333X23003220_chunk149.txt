DVT, Deep vein thrombosis.

after thermal ablation or FS of the GSV. Among studies
evaluating the incidence of thromboembolic complications after thermal ablation (12 RCTs, 19 case series) or
FS (12 RCTs, 6 case series), the individual incidence of
EHIT, DVT, and PE was <1% for all treatment modalities
(RFA, laser ablation, FS). Differences between treatment
modalities were judged not to be clinically meaningful.
While thrombotic complications after isolated endovenous ablation are uncommon, the incidence in patients
undergoing open procedures such as HL&S and/or phlebectomy may be as high as 6.25%.39,244 Concomitant
phlebectomy of tributaries has been identiﬁed as an independent risk factor for VTE development.242 These patients may not identify VTE symptoms due to pain
