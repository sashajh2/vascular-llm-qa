 review and meta-analysis, screening in
these deﬁned populations did reveal a beneﬁt with regard to the mortality outcome and less so for the stroke
outcome (Fig 4). Additionally, the systematic review
revealed that certain patient cohort populations might
be expected to have an approximate prevalence of
$20% of signiﬁcant carotid artery stenosis even if asymptomatic, making them appropriate to consider for
screening (Fig 5)14:

Subgroups
Patients with PAD. Patients with lower extremity PAD
have an increased prevalence of carotid artery stenosis
and might beneﬁt from screening.86,87 The prevalence
of $60% carotid artery stenosis in patients with symptomatic lower extremity PAD is likely $20% and was
nearly 25% in one epidemiologic study.87
Multiple studies have conﬁrmed the high prevalence of
carotid artery stenosis in patients with lower extremity
PAD.86,88-97 In one study of >400 patients with PAD undergoing surgery, patients with occult carotid stenosis
were also noted to have an increased risk of stroke in
the postoperative period.96 In that study, the risk of stroke
in patients with symptomatic high-grade stenosis was
ameliorated by performing CEA either before or simultaneously with the designated arterial bypass surgery.96
However, it has generally been accepted that if carotid
stenosis is asymptomatic, intervention for critical limb
ischemia can proceed before consideration of carotid
revascularization. Nevertheless, carotid screening for patients with lower extremity PAD is clearly appropriate,
considering the markedly increased risk of occult disease.
Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery.
Multiple reports have documented a markedly increased
prevalence of occult carotid artery stenosis in patients
with CAD, especially in those undergoing coronary artery
bypass surgery.84,85,98-107 Two direct comparative studies
regarding screening of CABG patients using the actual
outcomes of stroke and death have
