increased by 1.1% (OR, 1.011; 95% CI, 1.003-1.019; P ¼
.005). Even low levels of smoking increase risk: With
one cigarette smoked per day increment, the risk of
extracranial carotid disease increased by 1.0% (OR,
1.010; 95% CI, 1.001-1.020; P ¼ .03). Finally, with one
pack-year of smoking increment, the risk of extracranial
carotid disease increased by 0.7% (OR, 1.007; 95% CI,
1.002-1.012; P < .01).108 Cigarette smoking has been
demonstrated to be associated with plaque progression,109 but no signiﬁcant association was identiﬁed between cigarette smoking and intracranial carotid
disease.108
As comprehensive vascular specialists, vascular surgeons should counsel patients regarding the deleterious
impact of smoking on overall health as well as cerebrovascular well-being. There is clear evidence that counseling is an efﬁcacious strategy that can be supported
by a number of pharmacologic adjuncts.110 In an analysis
of 12 reviews including 267 studies and more than
101,000 participants, nicotine replacement therapy was
superior to placebo (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.71-1.99) and bupropion (Wellbutrin/Zyban) was also superior to placebo

(OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.60-2.06). Varenicline (Chantix) was also
superior to placebo in achieving quitting (OR, 2.88; 95%
CI, 2.40-3.47). Bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy were found to be equally efﬁcacious. Conversely, varenicline was superior to single forms of nicotine
replacement therapy (OR, 1.57; 95% CI,
