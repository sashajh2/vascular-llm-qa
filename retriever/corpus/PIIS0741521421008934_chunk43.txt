2,6,15,33,122 A greater degree of stenosis is generally thought to represent a progressively increased risk of
future stroke.6,33 However, plaque morphology also clearly
plays a signiﬁcant role.122 The morphologic features of the
plaque likely related to the risk of future stroke include heterogeneity, measurement of plaque area and juxtaluminal
black area, gray-scale median, and echogenicity.
Duplex ultrasound is safe, accurate, and reliable.
Because it is heavily dependent on technique, it should
be performed in an accredited ultrasound laboratory.15
Duplex ultrasound is the ﬁrst-line imaging modality for
carotid artery imaging, screening, and the identiﬁcation
of patients with 70% to 99% stenosis of the internal carotid artery.75,123 The rationale for the widespread use of
Duplex ultrasound include its low cost, ease of performance, and robust sensitivity (85%-92%) and speciﬁcity
(84%).123,124 Consensus ultrasound criteria for diagnosing
the varying degrees of carotid artery stenosis have been
extensively developed, widely used, and validated.125
Duplex ultrasound also has the ability to evaluate features of plaque morphology that might indicate patients
with a high risk of stroke.122
Determination of the degree of carotid stenosis is determined by an analysis of the hemodynamic parameters obtained from Doppler ultrasound analysis, including the
peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities. The ultrasound
criteria for the degree of carotid stenosis should be deﬁned
by the angiographic and imaging correlation in each
vascular laboratory. The most commonly recognized
consensus criteria include a cutoff peak systolic velocity of
the internal carotid artery of $125 cm/s to denote angiographic stenosis of $50%. A combination of peak systolic
velocity of 230 cm/s and an end-diastolic velocity of
$100 cm/s or a peak systolic velocity ratio between the internal and common carotid artery of $4 can be used to predict a stenosis of $70%.126 Using these criteria, the reported
sensitivity, speciﬁcity
