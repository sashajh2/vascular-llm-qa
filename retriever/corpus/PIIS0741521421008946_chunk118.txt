compared with the percutaneous approach, the inability
to use it in patients with calciﬁed and atherosclerotic
proximal CCA and proximal CCA diameter of less than
6 mm or in patients with less than 5 cm distance from
the clavicle to the carotid bifurcation. Short-term results from the ROADSTER study of high-risk patients
undergoing TCAR with the ENROUTE neuroprotection
and stent system showed the lowest stroke risk (1.4%)
compared with all other prospective and randomized

clinical trials of endovascular carotid intervention.177
These ﬁndings persisted up to 1 year with a 0.6% incidence of ipsilateral stroke and 3.7% overall mortality after
TCAR with dynamic ﬂow reversal.178 A recent study by
Malas et al from the VQI/SVS TCAR Surveillance Project
(TSP) showed that transfemoral CAS is associated with
twice the odds of in-hospital neurologic events
compared with TCAR.207,386,387 Another study by Schermerhorn et al388 from the TSP, showed no signiﬁcant
difference in stroke and death rate between TCAR and
CEA. A more recent and larger analysis by Malas et al208
from TSP showed a signiﬁcant reduction in risk of CNI
and MI in TCAR in comparison with CEA.
Although the transfemoral approach remains the most
commonly used access in daily practice, advances in
endovascular technology may result in shifting the access site to TCAR to optimize CAS safety, especially in
elderly patients and those with unfavorable aortic arch
anatomy. However, long-term follow-up is needed to
validate the beneﬁts of these new technologies.
Summary and recommendations.
1. Transfemoral CAS should be performed with distal or
proximal protection devices.
2. There is no evidence of superiority of one DEP device
vs the others.
3. There is some evidence that proximal protection offers advantage over DEP by avoiding unprotected
lesion crossing.
4. TCAR with cerebral ﬂow reversal had the lowest reported stroke rate to date compare to all transfemoral
CAS studies.
