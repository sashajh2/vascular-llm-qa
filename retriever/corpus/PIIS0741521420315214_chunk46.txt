 routinely.113,117-119 Risk factors for SCI after
TEVAR include length of aortic coverage (especially
when it is in excess of 15 cm of the DTA) and existence
of infrarenal aortic disease.120 In addition to these
anatomic risk factors, chronic renal failure may also be
an important risk factor.121 According to one systematic
review, the incidence of SCI after TEVAR with and
without prophylactic CSF drain placement was 3.2%
and 3.5%, respectively.122 In contrast, a 2016 systematic
review of the use of lumbar drains in open repair and
TEVAR (including three randomized trials) concluded
that spinal drains prevent early SCI with an OR of 0.48
(95% CI, 0.30-0.76; P ¼ .002), absolute risk reduction of
4.5%, and number needed to treat of 23 in favor of CSF
drainage.123
There are many differences in institutional protocols for
CSF drain management. They vary widely from where to
level the drain (earlobe or spinal exit site), draining to a
target pressure vs to a target volume, what the baseline
pressure should be and the units (centimeters of water
or millimeters of mercury), and the maximum amount
of ﬂuid that should be drained (per hour, per 4 hours,
or per day) to avoid intracranial bleeding or herniation.
Other adjunctive methods of SCI risk reduction include
the routine use of naloxone and steroids, avoidance of
long-acting narcotics, and hemoglobin management
strategies, which vary across centers.113,124 An often-used
hemoglobin target is >10 mg/dL, especially for patients
who have symptoms of SCI. Rescue protocols also exist,
which include a further increase in systemic blood pressure to >100 mm Hg, a drop in the CSF drain pressure
(often 5 mm Hg or 7 mm Hg), transfusion to a target hemoglobin level of >10 mg/dL, and the use of steroids.125
