atherosclerosis.3,25 It is for this reason that the goal of
carotid bifurcation imaging is to detect “high-risk” patients with signiﬁcant carotid bifurcation plaque who
would be likely to beneﬁt from therapy to reduce their
stroke risk.3
Many factors drive stroke risk, but among patients with
atherosclerosis of the carotid bifurcation, the most
important seem to be a history of prior neurologic symptoms, severity or degree of stenosis, and, to a lesser
extent, plaque characteristics such as ulceration, intraplaque hemorrhage, and composition.3
Symptomatic patients
It is important to image the carotid bifurcation in all
patients with symptoms of cerebral ischemia, whether
they present in as a TIA or completed stroke.3
Assuming signiﬁcant carotid artery disease is the cause
of symptoms, these patients are likely candidates for
carotid artery intervention to prevent an initial or secondary stroke.26
Typical carotid territory focal ischemic symptoms
include contralateral weakness of the face, upper extremity, lower extremity, or both; contralateral sensory
deﬁcit or paresthesia of the face, upper or lower extremity, or both; or transient ipsilateral blindness (amaurosis
fugax).3 Notably, more than 90% of people are right
handed, and language-related functions are controlled
by the left cerebral hemisphere in most of these individuals.27 In most right-handed individuals, if the right cerebral hemisphere is involved, other ischemic
manifestations may be observed. These include anosognosia, asomatognosia, neglect, visual, and sensory
extinction. To be noted that, even in left-handed individuals, speech is most often controlled by the left hemisphere. If the left hemisphere is involved, patients may
demonstrate aphasia, alexia, anomia, and agraphesthesia. Nonspeciﬁc neurologic symptoms that are not typically associated with carotid territory thromboembolic
events include vertigo, ataxia, diplopia, other visual disturbances, dysarthria, decreased consciousness, weakness, syncope, and dizziness.3 Although imaging is
most often performed with a car
