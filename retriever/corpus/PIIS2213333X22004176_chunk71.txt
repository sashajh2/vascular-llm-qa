 technical, with an
inability to treat the perforators in 8 of 34 limbs
(23.5%).201 Further studies to support perforator ablation
during the initial procedure in these unique situations
are warranted.
Guideline 4.2. For patients with varicose veins (C2)
and persistent or recurrent symptoms after previous
complete ablation of incompetent superﬁcial truncal
veins, we suggest treatment of IPVs if they are the
origin of symptomatic varicose tributaries.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak), quality of
evidence: C (low to very low)
Rationale. Once the incompetent truncal veins have
been treated in patients with CEAP class 2 varicose veins,
all these patients should return for procedural follow-up
and conﬁrmation that the symptoms and abnormal
