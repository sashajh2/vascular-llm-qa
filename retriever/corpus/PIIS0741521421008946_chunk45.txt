High risk for transfemoral CAS. Lesion morphology
has a signiﬁcant impact on outcomes for patients undergoing transfemoral CAS. Very tight stenosis, irregular
calciﬁed stenosis, and long lesions can limit the ability
to deliver the stent across the lesion.172,175 Carotid
bifurcation stent placement in heavily or circumferentially calciﬁed lesions has been associated with a
signiﬁcant risk of stent fracture and deformation.181
Fresh thrombus within the carotid bifurcation is a
contraindication to carotid stent placement with distal
embolic protection devices (EPDs) because of risk of
embolization while crossing the lesion as well
thrombus disruption and embolization after stent
placement. Similarly, long, complex lesions can increase risk of embolization during placement of the
distal EPD and should, therefore, be approached
cautiously when considering transfemoral CAS.175 It is
unclear how the presence of a carotid string sign impacts patient outcomes after transfemoral CAS.
High risk for TCAR. Similar to transfemoral CAS,
circumferential or large bulky carotid bifurcation plaques can limit the ability to deliver the stent across
the lesion. Carotid bifurcation stent placement in
heavily or circumferentially calciﬁed lesions has been
associated with signiﬁcant risk of stent fracture and
deformation. As a result, heavily calciﬁed carotid bifurcation lesions are a relative contraindication to stent
placement. Early data suggest that long, complex,
and echolucent lesions may be treated safely with
TCAR because of proximal ﬂow reversal before crossing
the stenosis. However, the level of evidence to support
this observation is much lower than that for CEA and
transfemoral CAS.
