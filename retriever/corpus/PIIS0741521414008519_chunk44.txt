 that both the vein wall and the
valve are involved in the primary events leading to venous
disease. Whether the vein wall changes precede valve
insufﬁciency or the valve insufﬁciency causes wall distention and wall changes is less clear.46 More important, evidence demonstrates that both vein wall and vein valve
are pathologically altered to cause primary venous disease. The perturbation in the microcirculation is a critical
component in the pathophysiologic process of CVD. The
endothelium is a key regulator of vascular tone, hemostasis, and coagulation. Injury, infection, immune diseases,
diabetes, genetic predisposition, environmental factors,
smoking, and atherosclerosis all have an adverse effect
on the endothelium, which in turn must compensate to
prevent further injury and maintain integrity of the
vascular wall. In CVD, the sine qua non is persistent
elevated ambulatory venous pressure. The effect on the
microcirculation begins with altered shear stress on the
endothelial cells, causing endothelial cells to release vasoactive agents and to express E-selectin, inﬂammatory
molecules, chemokines, and prothrombotic precursors.59,60 Mechanical forces, low shear stress, and stretch
are sensed by the endothelial cells through intercellular
adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1, CD54) and the mechanosensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid channels
that are present in the endothelium.60,61 It is well known
that patients with CVD have increased expression of
ICAM-1, which is expressed on endothelial cells and

activates the recruitment of leukocytes and initiates
endothelial transmigration, setting up an inﬂammatory
cascade.62,63 Initiating events likely involve altered shear
stress and mechanical stress forces on the endothelium
and its glycocalyx (a glycosaminoglycan on the surface
of endothelial cells); perturbations in nitric oxide production, in vasoactive substance release, and in the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1,
