 with arm elevation. The physical
examination can be used to estimate access diameter, its
depth from the skin, the presence of collateral veins and the
presence of accessory veins.
If upon clinical evaluation at 4 to 6 weeks the autogenous access is not clearly maturing adequately, further
investigation is warranted to identify potentially remediable
anatomic lesions. These may include a venous or arterial
stenosis, competing veins, large patent branches, or excessive depth from the skin.27 The assessment may be performed either by DU scanning or by an imaging study.
Several studies have demonstrated that at least 80% of
immature autogenous accesses can be salvaged after correcting one or more underlying lesions.84,85 Moreover,
immature autogenous accesses with correctable anatomic
lesions that are repaired percutaneously or surgically are
much more likely to achieve suitability for dialysis compared with those that do not undergo a corrective
procedure.86
A mature autogenous access requires three components: (1) an adequate diameter to permit safe cannulation
with dialysis needles without infiltration, (2) an adequate
access flow rate to permit achieving an access blood flow of
ⱖ500 mL/min,87,88 and (3) it must be sufficiently superficial to permit recognition of landmarks and accurate, safe
cannulation.27 The access blood flow increases dramatically
within 24 hours of autogenous access placement and
reaches most of its maximum flow within 3 to 6 weeks.89,90
Similarly, most of the increase in access diameter is achieved
within 4 to 8 weeks of autogenous access placement.87
When the clinical examination is equivocal, a postoperative DU study can be helpful. Specifically, measurement of
the vein diameter and access blood flow is useful in predicting access functionality. When the vein diameter is ⱖ4 mm
and the access blood flow is ⱖ500 mL/min, there is a 95%
likelihood that the autogenous access will be usable for
dialysis. If the vein diameter is ⬍4 mm and the access blood
flow is ⬍500 mL/min, only 33% of autogenous accesses are
likely to be suitable for dialysis. If only one of the two
criteria is met, the likelihood of access success
