The strength of the VCSS is in its evaluative properties
in identifying subtle intrasubject changes over time after an
intervention.122,123 An evaluation of each VCSS component allows outcome analysis on many levels, including
technical, patient-reported, and clinical outcomes. In this
sense, the revised VCSS is unique among clinical outcome
assessments and PROs. Although it is administered by a
physician, components such as pain are scored by patient
responses to subjective questions.78
To assess the benefit of a therapy, primary clinical
outcome standards are usually combined with a secondary
surrogate outcome assessment.124 Recommended reporting standards and outcome assessment for endovenous
ablation have recently been published in a joint statement
of the AVF and the Society of Interventional Radiology.124
Clinical outcomes. Clinical outcome studies evaluate
the results of procedures on patient-focused outcomes,
including symptom improvement, recurrence of varicosity,
healing or recurrence of skin ulcers, improvement in the
chronic, progressive symptoms of CVD, improved QOL,
and cosmetic improvement.124
Relief of symptoms. To report improvement in
symptoms of CVD, we recommend the use of the revised
VCSS in daily clinical practice.78 For research and publications to report outcomes, one of the validated, diseasespecific QOL instruments should be added, such as
VEINES-QOL/Sym questionnaire scale, CIVIQ-2, the
AVVQ, or the CXVUQ score in patients with advanced
venous disease.2,3,109-113 A validated Likert pain scale can
also be used, although most QOL questionnaires assess
pain and discomfort.
Disease severity. We recommend using the basic
CEAP clinical classification along with the revised VCSS in
routine clinical practice. The revised VCSS is the best
currently available instrument to quantify improvement
and assess changes in the severity of CVD during follow-up
(short-term, ⬍1 year, midterm, 1-3 years, long term, ⬎3
years; Table IV).108 For research purposes, the complete
CEAP classification should be used in addition to evaluation of QOL after treatment to help to assess the patient’s
perception of the burden of the disease
