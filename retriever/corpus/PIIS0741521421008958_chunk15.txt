3%, respectively), whereas peripheral artery disease alone was associated with a yield of 18%.
The certainty in the yield of screening outcome is likely
to be moderate or high.
Comparative studies did not show a statistically signiﬁcant difference between the screened and unscreened
populations in terms of death or stroke (2 studies; RR,
0.38; 95% CI, 0.00-1432.82; Supplementary Table I, online
only) and (2 studies; RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.00-1024.93;
Supplementary Table I, online only); respectively. Certainty
in evidence was very low owing to severe imprecision.
Question 5: Optimal sequence for carotid intervention
in patients with combined carotid and coronary disease
We included 26 studies, 2 of which were RCTs and 24
were observational studies. One RCT had a low risk of
bias, and the other one had a moderate risk owing to
unclear blinding of outcome assessors. Ten of the
observational studies had a low overall risk of bias
and 14 had a moderate risk of bias. The studies reported on 53,577 patients (mean age, 70 years; 72%
males). Common comorbidities were hypertension,

Combined CEA and coronary artery bypass grafting
vs coronary artery bypass grafting ﬁrst. Estimates were
highly imprecise to derive conclusions about the outcomes of death (10 studies; RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.32-1.05;

RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.34-2.22; Supplementary Table I, online
