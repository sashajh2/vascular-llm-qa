SPACE, ICSS, and CREST studies.38 These four trials randomized a total of 4754 symptomatic patients with
>50% internal carotid artery stenosis. The median length
of follow-up was 2 to 6.9 years. The risk of stroke or death
within 120 days of the index procedure was 5.5% for CEA
and 8.7% for CAS (risk difference, 3.2%; 95% CI, 1.7-4.7). After the periprocedural period of 120 days, no differences
were found in the annual rate of late ipsilateral stroke
(annual event rate, 0.60% for CEA vs 0.64% for CAS).
These ﬁndings lend support that both procedures have
similar durability, although the long-term outcomes
have continued to favor CEA owing to the lower periprocedural stroke and death rate (Figs 2 and 3).
Concern might exist regarding whether the data from
RCTs of CEA and CAS can be extrapolated to real world
experience. In general, those performing CAS in these trials were highly experienced and rigorously adjudicated
before being allowed to enroll patients. In a review of
physicians treating Medicare beneﬁciaries with

CAS, <10% of physicians would have met the criteria to
participate in the CREST owing to a lack of volume or a
high complication rate.39 It is unclear whether results
similar to those from RCTs will be obtained for CAS by
operators who might be less experienced or for patients
who would not be eligible for clinical trials. Nolan et al40
reviewed data from the Vascular Study Group of New England and showed a higher rate of stroke and death for
symptomatic patients treated with CAS compared with
those treated with CEA (5.1% with CAS vs 1.6% with
CEA; P ¼ .001). Similarly, Hicks et al41 studied almost
52,000 carotid procedures in the VQI and
