of the recommended interventions. The availability of
surgical expertise and institutional experience were
also factors that were considered when making the
recommendations. Stroke prevention was considered
the most critical outcome across all guideline questions, and the overall certainty of the evidence was
dependent on the certainty for this outcome. The
guideline committee made strong recommendations
for the third question (timing of revascularization)
despite the variable certainty of the direct evidence,
based on additional indirect evidence and by placing
greater value on avoiding the possibility of any worsening of neurologic deﬁcits. The strong recommendation against routine screening for average risk
patients was determined by the lack of comparative
studies showing improvement in outcomes with
screening.

Evidence and rationale
Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared
CEA and best medical therapy. The results of the ACAS
(asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis study)2 and ACST
(asymptomatic carotid surgery trial)5 favored CEA in the
treatment of low surgical risk patients with severe asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. The ACAS, which randomized 1662 patients to immediate CEA vs medical therapy
demonstrated the superiority of CEA over antiplatelet
therapy alone for asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis of >60% (5.1% for surgical patients and 11.0% for patients treated medically; aggregate risk reduction, 53%;
95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 22%-72%).2 The ACAS recommended CEA for patients aged <80 years as long as
the expected combined stroke and mortality rate for
the individual surgeon was not >3%. The conclusions
from the ACAS were supported by a subsequent larger
RCT that had randomized 3120 patients to immediate
CEA vs medical therapy.5
