or biochemical abnormality in the vein wall, although the
etiology can also be multifactorial. Labropoulos et al54
proposed that the origin of venous reflux in patients with
primary varicose veins can be local or multifocal structural
weakness of the vein wall and that this can occur together or
independently of proximal saphenous vein valvular incompetence. Varicosities can also develop as a result of secondary causes, such as previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT),
deep venous obstruction, superficial thrombophlebitis, or
arteriovenous fistula. Varicose veins may also be congenital
and present as a venous malformation.
Varicosities are manifestations of CVD.51,52 CVD includes various medical conditions of long duration, all
involving morphologic and functional abnormalities of the
venous system manifested by symptoms or signs (or both),
