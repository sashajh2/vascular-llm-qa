ABSTRACT
Background: To support the development of guidelines on the management of carotid disease, a writing committee
from the Society for Vascular Surgery has commissioned this systematic review.
Methods: We searched multiple data bases for studies addressing ﬁve questions: medical management vs carotid
revascularization (CEA) in asymptomatic patients, CEA vs carotid artery stenting (CAS) in symptomatic low surgical risk
patients, the optimal timing of revascularization after acute stroke, screening high-risk patients for carotid disease, and
the optimal sequence of interventions in patients with combined coronary and carotid disease. Studies were selected
and appraised by pairs of independent reviewers. Meta-analyses were performed when feasible.
Results: Medical management compared with carotid interventions in asymptomatic patients was associated with
better early outcome during the ﬁrst 30 days. However, CEA was associated with signiﬁcantly lower long-term rate of
stroke/death at 5 years. In symptomatic low-risk surgical patients, CEA was associated with a lower risk of stroke, but a
signiﬁcant increase in myocardial infarction compared with CAS during the ﬁrst 30 days. When the long-term outcome of
transfemoral CAS vs CEA in symptomatic patients were examined using preplanned pooled analysis of individual patient
data from four randomized trials, the risk of death or stroke within 120 days of the index procedure was 5.5% for CEA and
8.7% for CAS, which
