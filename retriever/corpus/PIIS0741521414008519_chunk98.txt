atomic venous system and presence of venous reﬂux or obstruction. The risk-to-beneﬁt ratio is weighed for
those procedures with more risk (lower, moderate, higher) considered later in the treatment when the beneﬁt is similar.

Superﬁcial Venous Reﬂux and Venous Leg Ulcer
Guideline 6.1 Superﬁcial Venous Reﬂux and Active
Venous Leg UlcerdUlcer Healing
In a patient with a venous leg ulcer (C6) and
incompetent superﬁcial veins that have axial reﬂux
directed to the bed of the ulcer, we suggest ablation
of the incompetent veins in addition to standard
compressive therapy to improve ulcer healing.
[GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 6.2 Superﬁcial Venous Reﬂux and Active
Venous Leg UlcerdPrevent Recurrence
In a patient with a venous leg ulcer (C6) and
incompetent superﬁcial veins that have axial reﬂux
directed to the bed of the ulcer, we recommend ablation of the incompetent veins in addition to standard
compressive therapy to prevent recurrence. [GRADE 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Our commissioned comparative systematic review and
meta-analysis of surgical interventions vs conservative
therapy including 11 studies (seven RCTs and four observational studies) favored open surgery vs compression for
ulcer healing, although the quality of the evidence was
low.31 In addition, other individual RCTs have shown a

difference that was not statistically signiﬁcant favoring surgical treatment of the superﬁcial venous system and
compression over compression alone.31,288,317 On the basis of these observations, the strength and grade of evidence favoring surgery for ulcer healing are limited to a
Grade 2C classiﬁcation. Regarding recurrence, our
commissioned comparative systematic review and metaanalysis included two RCTs, and each study favored
surgery plus compression over compression alone to a
statistically signiﬁcant degree for prevention of ulcer
recurrence.288,317,318 Because each study had some challenges in design and baseline imbalance, the strength
and grade of evidence is 1B.
