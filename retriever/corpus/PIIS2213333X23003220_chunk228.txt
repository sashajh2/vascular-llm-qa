1. VADs for CVD
This section reviews brieﬂy the scientiﬁc evidence supporting the clinical beneﬁt of Hydroxyethylrutosides, calcium dobesilate, Horse chestnut extract, Red vine leaf
extract and Sulodexide for patients with varicose veins
and CVD. None of these products are approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration for use in patients
with venous disease.
Clinical beneﬁt of hydroxyethylrutosides.
Rationale. Hydroxyethylrutosides are composed by
one or several bioﬂavonoids obtained from hydroxyethylation of rutoside (a combination of ﬂavonol quercetin
and disaccharide rutinose). Hydroxyrutoside is a potent
inhibitor of inﬂammation-related gene expression, and
production of inﬂammatory cytokines (nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1, IL-6) in macrophages and
neutrophils.101
Evidence. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 15
trials with 1643 patients17 evaluated the effect of
hydroxyrutoside,
with
or
without
compression
bandaging vs placebo, with or without compression
bandaging, and hydroxyrutoside vs compression
bandaging alone. Compared with placebo, a signiﬁcant
but modest reduction of pain, leg heaviness and cramps
were reported. The trials were of limited quality.
Clinical beneﬁt of calcium dobesilate.
Rationale.
Calcium
dobesilate
(calcium
2,5dihydroxybenzene-sulphonate) is a synthetic drug used
for CVI, hemorrhoids, and diabetic retinopathy. Experimental studies claimed a protective action against
oxidative stress in varicose veins291 and other beneﬁcial
effects such as regulation of apotosis,292 increased nitric
oxide synthase activity, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, diminished capillary fragility and hyperpermeability, reduction of platelet aggregation and
blood viscosity.101
Evidence. An RCT293 demonstrated improvement of
plethysmographic measurements after 6-month treatment. However, comparison vs placebo in another
