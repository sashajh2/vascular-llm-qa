 rates (93%100%) are of utmost importance in light of the young
age of many patients and excellent projected longterm survival that averages 90% at 10 years.31,32,49,59
The technical approach selected should be dictated
entirely by the patientâ€™s arterial and aneurysmal anatomy.
Whereas there are no prospective or randomized
data comparing open surgical techniques, Henke et al37
noted no difference in long-term event-free outcome
of patients undergoing aneurysmectomy with angioplastic closure or aneurysmectomy with bypass, with
mean life span calculated at 108 and 130 months,
respectively. Pfeiffer et al50 demonstrated superior
patency rates for angioplastic repairs in comparison
to those reconstructions requiring saphenous vein
interposition (100% vs 73%). Moreover, this technique
yields no recurrent aneurysmal degeneration with
follow-up.37,50 Whereas cooled (4 ) renal perfusion
supplemented with mannitol or prostaglandin E has
been advocated by several authors either routinely or

evidence

3.1

We suggest daily antiplatelet therapy (ie, low-dose aspirin) for patients with RAA.

2 (Weak)

C (Low)

3.2

We suggest open surgical reconstructive techniques for the elective repair of most
RAAs in patients with acceptable operative risk.

2 (Weak)

B (Moderate)

3.3

We suggest ex vivo repair and autotransplantation for complex distal branch
aneurysms over nephrectomy when it is technically feasible.

2 (Weak)

B (Moderate)

3.4

We suggest endovascular techniques for the elective repair of anatomically appropriate
RAAs to include stent graft exclusion of main RAAs in patients with poor operative
risk and embolization of distal and parenchymal aneurysms.

2 (Weak)

B (Moderate)

3.5

We suggest consideration of laparoscopic and robotic techniques as an interventional
alternative based on institutional resources and surgeon experience with minimally
invasive techniques.
