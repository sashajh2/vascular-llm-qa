 database, assessing 22,355 patients with CABG
between 2011 and 2016. Results showed that concomitant CEA did not reduce stroke risk regardless of the patient having an off-pump or on-pump CABG, although a
directly comparison to a staged approach was not
possible.537 An additional meta-analysis of 21,710 synchronous CABG-CEA patients and 23,185 staged patients,
found that the simultaneous CABG-CEA group had
higher 30-day mortality and stroke, but a lower risk of
MI compared with the staged group.538 These large
meta-analyses suggest that combined CABG-CEA may
not be indicated in most patients (see Clinical Practice
Guidelines document).
Although one may consider intervention in patients
with asymptomatic disease in some cases, a logical
follow-up question is whether all CABG patients should
be preoperatively screened for carotid disease. The prevalence of asymptomatic carotid artery disease (>70%) is
5% to 10% in patients undergoing CABG, but it is less
clear whether identifying the stenosis before CABG will
affect patient outcomes.539,540 However, when assessing
the literature in aggregate, screening for carotid stenosis
results in improved mortality (see Clinical Practice Guidelines). Several society guidelines, including those from
the American College of Cardiology Foundation, recommend screening among asymptomatic patients with
planned CABG. In addition, patients with clinical factors

that may increase the likelihood of identifying severe carotid stenosis including increased age, carotid bruit, history of prior stroke/TIA, and left main stem disease,
should undergo carotid imaging.525,541,542
CAS may be an option to reduce stroke risk before
CABG. Several studies demonstrate a trend toward
decreased stroke risk in patients treated with CAS before
CABG.543-545 A review of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample found a 62% higher perioperative stroke risk after
combined CEA and CABG (3.9
