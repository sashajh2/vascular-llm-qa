 better early outcomes, although
the effect may not be as durable even though the
long-term survival rates seem to be similar with appropriate reintervention when needed. Unfortunately, the
overall quality of the evidence was deemed to be low.
The ﬁndings from our meta-analysis are largely consistent with several other comparable reviews examining
the optimal revascularization strategy for patients with
CMI (Table II). Saedon et al110 (12 studies and 7365 patients) reported no differences in perioperative
morbidity, perioperative mortality or survival, but a
marked increase in patency (odds ratio [OR], 3.57; 95%
CI, 1.83-6.97; P ¼ .0002) in the open group. Cai et al111

(8 studies and 569 patients) reported no difference in
perioperative mortality or survival between the groups,
but a lower perioperative complication and higher recurrence rate in the endovascular group. Gupta et al113 (1939
patients) reported that the open repair was associated
with a higher perioperative complication rate, higher
5-year primary patency (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.4-5.8;
P < .001) and higher 5-year freedom from recurrent
symptoms (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 2.8-7.0; P < .001) despite no
difference in perioperative mortality or survival. Last,
Pecoraro et al112 (43 studies and 1795 patients) reported
lower
