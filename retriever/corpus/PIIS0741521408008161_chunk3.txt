the SVS requested an update of previous reviews to determine the current status of the research evidence about the
treatment of carotid artery stenosis in the two clinical
scenarios of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
In issuing clinical practice guidelines, the SVS has
adopted the GRADE system because it separates the quality
of evidence from the strength of recommendations.8 This
separation allows guideline users (clinicians, patients, and
policymakers) to recognize factors other than evidence,
such as patient values and preferences that guideline committees considered when making these recommendations.
Hence, despite lower quality evidence, the committee may
issue a strong recommendation if the values and preferences
that guideline developers bring to bear are such that when
considering even low quality evidence, they are confident
that the benefits of an intervention outweigh its undesirable
outcomes (or vice versa).9
The GRADE system depicts recommendations as either strong (GRADE 1) denoted by the phrase “we recommend” or weak (GRADE 2) denoted by the phrase “we
suggest”. Aside from the strength of recommendations, the
quality of evidence is rated as high quality (typically derived
from well conducted large and consistent randomized trials), moderate quality (typically derived from less rigorous
or inconsistent randomized trials or some observational
studies), and low or very low quality (derived from observational studies, case series, and unsystematic clinical observations).
In this article, the carotid committee of the SVS presents five key recommendations encompassing several permutations and clinical scenarios to clarify the roles of carotid endarterectomy, carotid stenting, and best medical
care, in the management of symptomatic and asymptomatic
patients with low, moderate, and severe degrees of stenosis.
Recommendations are followed by the corresponding evidence: values and preferences, which are factors other than
evidence that the committee considered when issuing recommendations; and if needed, technical remarks, describing the committee’s consensus regarding best practices in
medical management, carotid endarterectomy, and carotids stenting.
