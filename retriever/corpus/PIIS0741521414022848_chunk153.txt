SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL (online only).
A revised recommendation: Society for Vascular
Surgery practice guidelines for the management of
asymptomatic disease and claudication
The Society for Vascular Surgery has an established methodology1 for the development of clinical practice guidelines
that considers future emerging evidence. Changes in the evidence base necessitate subsequent updated recommendations. Recently, a report of a randomized controlled trial2
that compared ramipril to a matching placebo was retracted.3
The trial had shown that 10 mg/d of ramipril given for 24
weeks to patients with intermittent claudication (IC)
increased mean pain-free walking time, maximum walking
time, Walking Impairment Questionnaire scores and the
Physical Component Summary score. The Society guideline
published earlier this year4 had considered evidence from
this trial and suggested the use of ramipril in patients with
IC (Recommendation 4.11). The recommendation was a
weak one (ie, suggestion) because the trial was small and
the results had not been replicated in other trials with a longer
follow up period.
The Society’s committee charged with developing
guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower
extremities has decided to strike recommendation 4.11 based
on the current state of evidence after retraction of this trial.
The committee notes that many patients with IC may
still beneﬁt from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
