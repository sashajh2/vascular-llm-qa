ablation is unfortunately difﬁcult due to the very low
number of events and limited statistical power. Although
inconsistent across studies, suggested risk factors for
EHIT/DVT have included age, male gender, CEAP class,
personal or family history of VTE, known thrombophilia,
reduced mobility, obesity, hormone therapy, active cancer, concomitant procedures including sclerotherapy
and microphlebectomy, large GSV diameter, and a history of SVT.41,233,242,247,248 Given such uncertainty,
deciding who constitutes a high-risk patient requires
some degree of clinical judgment at present. Although
one single-center study has shown the Caprini risk

assessment score to be associated with the development
of EHIT (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.24-2.0; P ¼ .0002), only ultrasound identiﬁed EHIT I to II were found in this study and
it remains unclear whether the Caprini score is predictive
of clinically relevant thrombotic events after superﬁcial
venous intervention.248
Currently, no speciﬁc guidelines address the role of VTE
risk stratiﬁcation in the ambulatory surgery setting. Data
from patients undergoing both inpatient and outpatient
procedures suggests that identiﬁcation of patient and
procedural related risk factors allows for identiﬁcation
of 15- to 20-fold variation in VTE risk. Individualized risk
stratiﬁcation allows for the identiﬁcation of low-risk patients in whom the risk-beneﬁt ratio is unfavorable, and
potentially for the identiﬁcation of patients at high VTE
risk in whom the beneﬁt of receiving chemical chemoprophylaxis outweighs the attendant bleeding risk. A
widely accepted risk threshold is a calculated VTE risk
of 3%, assuming a two-fold reduction in VTE events
compared with expected bleeding events from administration of an anticoagulant.241 Currently, no VTE risk
assessment model (RAM) has been validated in patients
