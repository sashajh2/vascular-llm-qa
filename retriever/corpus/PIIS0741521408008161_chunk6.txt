led to quit. Counseling and smoking
cessation medications have been found to be effective in
helping smokers to quit. Lower quality evidence suggested
possible benefits of avoiding environmental tobacco
smoke, reduction of alcohol consumption by heavy drinkers, weight reduction for obese patients, and increasing
physical activity. Antiplatelet agents are recommended for
patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA.
Aspirin (50 to 325 mg/d), the combination of aspirin and
extended-release dipyridamole, and clopidogrel are all acceptable options for initial therapy.13

RECOMMENDATION
In symptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (â±–50%) we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus optimal medical therapy (GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence).
Evidence
Moderate stenosis. Among symptomatic NASCET
patients with stenosis of 50% to 69%, the 5-year rate of any
ipsilateral stroke was 15.7% in patients treated surgically
compared with 22.2% in those treated medically. To prevent one ipsilateral stroke during the 5-year follow up
period, 15 patients would have to undergo carotid
endarterectomy.11
High-grade stenosis. Symptomatic NASCET patients with stenosis of 70% to 99% who underwent endarterectomy had a cumulative risk of any ipsilateral stroke at 2
years of 9% compared with 26%for those who were treated
medically. To prevent one ipsilateral stroke, six patients
would have to undergo carotid endarterectomy. For a
major or fatal ipsilateral stroke, the corresponding estimates
were 2.5% and 13.1%. To prevent one major or fatal ipsilateral stroke, nine patients would have to undergo carotid
endarterectomy.10
Results from ECST were similarly supportive of endarterectomy in symptomatic patients with 70% to 99% stenosis. The 3-year risk of ipsilateral stroke was 2.8% in patients
randomized to endarterectomy and16.
