, a
portion of the venous duplex ultrasound examination should
be performed in the upright or standing position. Augmentation maneuvers include Valsalva maneuver for common
femoral vein and saphenofemoral junction and use of
manual or cuff compression/release placed distal to the
point of examination for lower extremity veins below the
femoral junction.151,152 Most studies suggest criteria for
valvular incompetence when valve closure time exceeds

$1 second for femoral and popliteal veins and $0.5 second
for great saphenous vein, small saphenous vein, tibial veins,
deep femoral vein, and perforating veins.153 However, use
of $0.5 second for all superﬁcial and deep vein segments
can signiﬁcantly improve the reliability of reﬂux detection.154 Perforator vein is deﬁned as pathologic when directional ﬂow is from deep to superﬁcial, valve closure time is
$0.5 second, vein diameter exceeds 3.5 mm, and location
of perforator is beneath healed or active VLU.155,156
Venous duplex ultrasound not only provides diagnostic
utility but also will identify patterns of venous disease that
may have therapeutic implications.157,158 Because VLUs
are usually associated with multilevel disease affecting the superﬁcial, deep, and perforating veins, better deﬁning these
variable patterns of venous disease is critically important
before any treatment. Evidence supports that 74% to 93%
of all patients with VLUs will have superﬁcial vein involvement, but superﬁcial venous reﬂux will be isolated in only
17% to 54% of the limbs, the remainder of which will have
either isolated or combined associated deep vein incompetence or obstruction or perforator incompetence.159-161
Additional anatomic patterns of axial reﬂux directed to the
bed of the VLU are important to be deﬁned.162

We suggest selective use of venous plethysmography in the evaluation of patients with suspected
