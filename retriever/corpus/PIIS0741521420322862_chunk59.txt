 the supraceliac
aorta (antegrade bypass) and the infrarenal aorta/common iliac arteries (retrograde bypass). The ultimate
determinant of the inﬂow choice (and the bypass conﬁguration) is contingent upon the distribution of the arterial
occlusive disease and the provider familiarity with
various exposures. The supraceliac aorta tends to be relatively spared from atherosclerotic disease, although the
exposure is a bit more complicated and mandates mobilizing the left lobe of the liver and incising the crus of the
diaphragm. It is possible to place a partial occluding

clamp on the supraceliac aorta (eg, Satinsky) and maintain visceral perfusion while avoiding some of the hemodynamic changes associated with a complete
supravisceral aortic clamp, although this maneuver is
not always possible. The infrarenal aorta and iliac vessels
can be suitable donor sites, although they are more
prone to atherosclerotic occlusive disease that preclude
their use, as seen in the case of a circumferentially calciﬁed infrarenal aorta commonly referred to as the porcelain aorta. The potential options in this setting included
replacing the involved aortoiliac segment or simply
choosing another inﬂow site. A variety of alternative
inﬂow sources have been describe, including the
ascending aorta,145 the descending aorta,145 and the axillary artery,146 although the published experience is small.
The retrograde open mesenteric stenting is a reasonable hybrid (ie, open and endovascular) alternative for
patients with extensive aortoiliac occlusive disease,
particularly for those involving both the infrarenal and suprarenal aorta, because it does not require the placement of an aortic (or iliac clamp).147 Oderich et al148
recently reported the collective experience (n ¼ 54)
with open retrograde stenting for both CMI (19%) and
AMI (81%) from the Low Frequency Vascular Disease
Research Consortium. The technical success rate was
excellent (98%) and the patency rates at 2 years (primary,
76% 6 8%; secondary 90% 6 8%)
