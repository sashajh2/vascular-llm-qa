 immediate EVAR with surveillance for AAAs between 4.1 and
5.4 cm (CAESAR) and 4.0 and 5.0 cm (PIVOTAL) and
found no survival beneﬁt for early EVAR, but neither
trial was designed to determine whether immediate
EVAR might be beneﬁcial or harmful for speciﬁc AAA
size ranges or age subgroups. A Cochrane database
review280 of these four studies demonstrated no advantage to immediate repair by open surgery or EVAR for
small AAAs (4.0-5.5 cm).
Patients with an asymptomatic fusiform AAA >5.4 cm
should be considered for repair, and surveillance is

recommended for smaller aneurysms. An individualized
approach may be appropriate for patients with an AAA
>5.4 cm but who are of advanced age or have signiﬁcant
comorbid conditions. Alternatively, young, healthy
patients, particularly women, with an AAA between 5.0
and 5.4 cm or those with rapid expansion of small
fusiform AAAs may beneﬁt from early repair.9,273,281,282

We recommend repair for the patient who presents with an
AAA and abdominal or back pain that is likely to be
attributed to the aneurysm.
