 would mandate further assessment and management before planned aneurysm
repair. In the absence of an active cardiovascular condition, further testing, as dictated by functional capacity
and cardiovascular risk factors, is indicated only if the results will change the planned treatment approach.
Functional capacity can be estimated from a simple activity assessment (Table IV). Patients capable of moderate physical activities, such as climbing two ﬂights of
stairs or running a short distance (MET $ 4), will not
beneﬁt from further testing. Those who do not function
at this level or in whom physical reserve cannot be
assessed will beneﬁt from cardiac testing if it will
change operative management.91 Recent studies suggest that low anaerobic threshold (#10 mL O2/kg/min)
during exercise testing, as a measure of aerobic capacity, is predictive of cardiovascular complications as well
as of early and late death after aortic aneurysm
repair.92-94
All patients should be evaluated with a 12-lead ECG
within 30 days of planned repair. Although resting
left ventricular function, as determined by an echocardiogram, does not predict postoperative MI or death,
echocardiography is recommended for those patients
with dyspnea of unknown origin or worsening
dyspnea in the setting of a history of congestive heart
failure.
In patients with active cardiac conditions, including unstable
angina, decompensated heart failure, severe valvular
disease, and signiﬁcant arrhythmia, we recommend
cardiology consultation before EVAR or OSR.

In patients with signiﬁcant clinical risk factors, such as
coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure,
cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal
insufﬁciency, and unknown or poor functional capacity
(MET < 4), who are to undergo OSR or EVAR, we suggest
noninvasive stress testing.

We recommend a preoperative resting 12-lead ECG in all
patients undergoing EVAR or OSR within 30 days of
planned treatment.
