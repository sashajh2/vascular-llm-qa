 position, no endoleak) in the
first 12 to 36 months, some have suggested decreasing the
frequency to 2 to 5 years, while others have expressed that,
lacking any evidence to the contrary, follow-up for traumatic thoracic aortic injuries should be no different than
those treated with TEVAR for other pathologies. There
was, however, some consensus suggesting that a combination of a multi-view chest x-ray and a magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) may be preferable over conventional
contrast computed tomographic angiography (CTA) for
long-term imaging, with due consideration of the metallic
composition of the endograft.
CONCLUSION
Although the quality of evidence is very low, TEVAR
for traumatic thoracic aortic injury is associated with im-

proved outcomes compared with open repair, especially
about its lower mortality and incidence of spinal cord
ischemia. However, this finding should be tempered by the
current lack of suitable devices that can accommodate the
unique anatomy of these patients, which has occasionally
resulted in severe procedure-related complications, and the
unknown natural history of the endovascular repair and the
optimal follow-up strategy.
