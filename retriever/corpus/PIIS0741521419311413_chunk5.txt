Abstract
Results: The systematic search revealed a total of 242 publications for possible inclusion. On the basis of title and
abstract review, two randomized controlled trials and nine case-cohort series ﬁt our inclusion criteria. There were
no statistically signiﬁcant differences in failure rates (pooled risk ratio [RR], 1.10; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI],
0.79-1.55; P ¼ .25), 1-year primary patency rates (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.83-2.06; P ¼ 0.24), 1-year secondary patency rates
(RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.54-1.77), 2-year primary patency rates (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 0.99-2.83; P [ .05), and 2-year secondary patency rates (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.54-2.63; P ¼ .67) between both groups. However, the two-stage procedure had
signiﬁcantly improved 2-year primary patency rates (RR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.66-3.74; P < .00001). There were no differences in steal syndrome, hematoma, infection, pseudoaneuryms, or stenosis, although there was a trend toward
an increased incidence of postoperative thrombosis (RR, 1.81; 95% CI, 0.95-3.45; P ¼ .07) in one-stage procedures.
