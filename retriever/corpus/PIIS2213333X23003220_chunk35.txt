 therefore, does not support routine preprocedure DUS for patients with C1 disorder.
1.5.3. In symptomatic patients with varicose veins
(CEAP Class C2), the deep venous system should be
routinely evaluated for infrainguinal obstruction or
valvular incompetence.

Rationale. Deep venous pathology, including reﬂux and
obstruction, may affect outcomes and complications
following interventions for superﬁcial venous incompetence. Evaluation of the deep system in C2 patients with
symptomatic CVD, therefore, is recommended.8,68
Evidence. Among 4881 patients who underwent endovenous ablation for superﬁcial truncal vein in the Vascular
Quality Initiative database, 2254 patients (46.2%) had
combined deep and superﬁcial reﬂux (Table II). After a
median follow-up of 336 days, symptoms improved in
both groups and improvement in VCSS score was greater
in patients with deep vein reﬂux. These patients, however,
had substantially higher rates of complications (10.4% vs
3.0%; P < .001), including paresthesia (2.5% vs 0.7%; P <
.001), skin pigmentation (1.2% vs 0.4%; P ¼ .023), superﬁcial
phlebitis (2.0% vs 0.9%; P ¼ .018), wound infection (0.8% vs
0.2%; P ¼ .040), and proximal thrombus extension (3.1% vs
1.1%; P < .001). After controlling for confounding factors,
the estimate of effect size for any complication had an
odd ratio (OR) of 5.72 (P < .001).74 Gianesini et al75 retrospectively analyzed long-term results of the CHIVA procedure in 381 patients and found an increased risk of GSV
reﬂux recurrence among those patients who initially had
reﬂuxing common femoral veins.75 Other investigators
found that ablation of superﬁcial reﬂux may restore
segmental competence of the deep veins76 and that
clinical outcome is excellent after superﬁcial ablation
