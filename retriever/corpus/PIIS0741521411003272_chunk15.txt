chronic venous disorder is reserved for the full spectrum of
venous abnormalities and includes dilated intradermal veins
and venules between 1 and 3 mm in diameter (spider veins,
reticular veins, telangiectasia; CEAP class C1).
Varicose veins can progress to a more advanced form of
chronic venous dysfunction such as chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).55,56 In CVI, increased ambulatory venous
hypertension initiates a series of changes in the subcutaneous tissue and the skin: activation of the endothelial
cells, extravasation of macromolecules and red blood
cells, diapedesis of leukocytes, tissue edema, and chronic
inflammatory changes most frequently noted at and
above the ankles.41,53 Limb swelling, pigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis, eczema, or venous ulcerations can
