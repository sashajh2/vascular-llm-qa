atomic
closure rates were higher after HL/S vs RFA. Compared
with RFA, HL/S was signiﬁcantly associated with an
increased risk of minor AEs. At 1 year, those who
underwent UGFS had a higher risk of reintervention
than HL/S and had a higher risk of recurrent reﬂux. At
5 years, anatomic closure was the lowest among patients
who had UGFS. There was no difference in clinical
outcomes, patient-reported outcomes, or QoL scores in
patients using any interventional techniques.
The third question addresses outcomes of thermal vs
nonthermal ablations. Perioperative pain was signiﬁcantly lower after CAC and UGFS than after EVLA. Patients who had the MOCA procedure or UGFS had
better early QoL scores than those who had EVLT.
Anatomic closure rates were signiﬁcantly lower, and reinterventions were more frequent at 1 and 5 years after
UGFS than after EVLA or RFA. Recurrent reﬂux was
most frequent after UGFS. In one study93 of RFA and
two studies75,76 of EVLA, there were signiﬁcantly more
AEs than CAC. In a RCT by Brittenden et al,102 diseasespeciﬁc QoL 5 years after treatment was better after
EVLA than after UGFS (2.86; 95% CI, 4.49 to 1.22;
P < .001) and better after HL/S than after UGFS (2.60;
95% CI, 3.99 to 1.22; P < .001). Generic QoL measures
were similar. Early results of CAC vs RFA found no difference in anatomic closure or minor AEs in patients
treated for SSV incompetence.
The fourth question addresses the role of incompetent
perforator veins in the early stages of chronic venous insufﬁciency, such as CEAP 2 and 3 disease. One reason to
address the evidence related to perforator vein treatment
is that many vascular laboratories include a complete DUS
study to evaluate all patients with varicose veins. Because
