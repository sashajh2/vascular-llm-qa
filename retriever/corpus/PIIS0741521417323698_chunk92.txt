ciﬁcation or a femoral aneurysm. In addition, a history of
prior groin surgery with or without a vascular graft or
patch and obesity may reduce success rates.386-390
Percutaneous access with large sheaths is improved by
ultrasound guidance.386,391-393
Acute limb thrombosis. Early graft limb thrombosis
may occur in 2% of patients because of the placement
of a large limb in a small vessel, iliac tortuosity with graft
kinking, inadequate angioplasty or stenting, arterial
dissection, or injury at the access site.359,360,370,394-396
Postimplantation syndrome. A self-limited inﬂammatory state characterized by fever and elevated inﬂammatory markers may be observed after EVAR as a result
of new thrombus formation within the excluded aneurysm sac.397-401
Ischemic colitis. Colon ischemia due to occlusion of
the IMA or HA or embolization is rare after EVAR
(<1%).334,364,396,402,403 Circumﬂex femoral and circumﬂex
iliac arteries should be preserved should HA occlusion be
planned. Suspected colonic ischemia should be assessed
by endoscopy, and if it is conﬁrmed, antibiotics should be
administered and the patient maintained on intravenous
ﬂuids. Colectomy should be performed if full-thickness
necrosis is suspected.
Role of elective EVAR in the high-risk and unﬁt patient
The EVAR 2 trial compared EVAR with observation and
found no beneﬁt to EVAR for patients who were considered unﬁt for open repair because of a history of MI or
cardiac revascularization, stable angina, valvular heart
disease, signiﬁcant arrhythmia, uncontrolled congestive
heart failure, forced expiratory volume in 1 second <1 L,
or serum creatinine concentration >2.3 mg/dL.309 However, of those randomized to EVAR, only 179 of 197
(91%) underwent surgery
