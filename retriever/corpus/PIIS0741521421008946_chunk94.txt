.4% vs 0.8%; P ¼ .002). Estimated survival and freedom from stroke at 1 year were similar, but
the 1-year freedom from recurrent stenosis of greater
than 50% was lower for ECEA (89% vs 94%; P < .001).

The authors concluded that ECEA and CCEA appear to
yield similar outcomes.
Recently, Deser et al322 conducted a study to determine
whether there is a difference in postoperative blood pressure changes, stroke risk and postoperative complications after CCEA and ECEA. Mean operative and
cross-clamping time were shorter for ECEA (72 6 14.3 minutes vs 115 6 17.4 minutes; P < .001) and (22 6 7.7 vs 34 6
6.3; P < .001), respectively. No signiﬁcant difference was
noted between the groups in incidence of perioperative
stroke (P ¼ .501) or postoperative blood pressure difference at the 6th hour or 24th hour after surgery.
Meta-analysis of standard CEA vs ECEA. A Cochrane
Review316 of ﬁve randomized trials311-315,317 of 2465 patients (2590 arteries) also provided Level 1 evidence. In
this review (except for the EVEREST trial in which where
the ECEA was compared with both patch angioplasty
and primary closure), only CEA with patch angioplasty
was considered for comparison to ECEA. Results showed
an overall risk of any perioperative stroke/death of 2.1%
(1.7% for ECEA vs 2.6% for CCEA) with no signiﬁcant difference between techniques. Nor were there signiﬁcant
differences risk of early carotid thrombosis, MI, and local
