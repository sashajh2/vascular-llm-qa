 sustained-release silver sulfadiazine foam reduced
the level of bacteria cultured from infected VLUs, but there
was no correlation with an improvement in wound size.241
A Cochrane review on the use of topical silver for infected
VLUs concluded that there is insufﬁcient evidence to
recommend the use of silver-containing dressings or topical
agents for treatment of infected or contaminated chronic
wounds.244

Primary Wound Dressings
Guideline 4.14: Topical Dressing Selection
We suggest applying a topical dressing that will
manage venous leg ulcer exudate and maintain a moist,
warm wound bed. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C] We suggest selection of a primary wound
dressing that will absorb wound exudate produced by
the ulcer (alginates, foams) and protect the periulcer
skin. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
There is insufﬁcient evidence suggesting that a speciﬁc
primary dressing that contacts the wound can result in a
higher rate of wound closure. Most VLUs produce large
amounts of exudate. This ﬂuid contains high concentrations of proteases and inﬂammatory cytokines that may
damage surrounding healthy skin.245 Removal of wound
drainage from the wound bed will reduce the inﬂammatory
environment that prohibits wound healing. We recommend use of dressings that will manage wound exudate
and maintain a moist wound bed. Primary dressings with
high absorptive capabilities, including foams, alginates,
and other specialty dressings, are often selected for the primary coverage layer for heavily exudative VLUs.246
Guideline 4.15: Topical Dressings Containing
Antimicrobials
We recommend against the routine use of topical
antimicrobial-containing dressings in the treatment of
noninfected venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL
OF EVIDENCE - A]
In the only prospective RCT of topical antibiotics, which
examined the treatment of noninfected VLUs, Michaels et al
randomized 213 patients with VLUs to silver-releasing dressings compared with non-silver-re
