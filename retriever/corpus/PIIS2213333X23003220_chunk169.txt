) of the distal saphenous
vein should be performed.
Consensus statement.
14.2. For patients with an asymptomatic superﬁcial
truncal vein aneurysm, located >3 cm distal to the
SFJ, endovenous ablation alone should be performed.
Thromboprophylaxis in these patients reduces the
risk of VTE.

Consensus statement. 14.3. Patients with symptomatic, thrombosed or large (>3 cm) aneurysms in the superﬁcial veins are best treated with surgical excision.
Rationale. Focal dilation of the saphenous veins (GSV,
SSV, AAGSV, or PAGSV) that measures $20 mm for
GSV and 15 mm for SSV, or has a diameter that is three
times the upper limit of the average saphenous diameter
is considered an aneurysm.273 Most patients are asymptomatic or have a palpable lump at the groin or in the
popliteal fossa.274 Many patients present only with
symptoms of varicosity or CVI.158,275,276 Patients occasionally complain of a tender lump,277 that can be ﬁrm, if
the aneurysm is thrombosed.278 Evaluation with duplex
scanning is usually satisfactory, but congenital superﬁcial
truncal vein aneurysms may occur in patients with
venous malformations (Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome)279
and saphenous aneurysms may occasionally mimic
femoral hernia,274 synovial,280,281 or Baker cyst282 or
venous leiomyosarcoma.283 In these patients further
evaluation with computed tomography or magnetic
resonance imaging is warranted. When the saphenous
aneurysm is near the femoral or popliteal vein, open
surgical excision is indicated, with ligation or oversewing
of a dilated proximal saphenous stump.
