“atypical” leg symptoms that may reﬂect other pathophysiologic mechanisms (eg, myopathy) or the overlay of concomitant conditions, such as neuropathy, arthritis, and lumbar
spine disease, that inﬂuence lower extremity function.
Numerous population-based studies have attempted to
ascertain the relative proportion of symptomatic patients
amongst all those with PAD; taken in aggregate, these
studies indicate that the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic PAD is on the order of 1:3.9,11,12
The risk factors associated with PAD are similar to those
classically identiﬁed in the context of coronary artery disease,
although the relative importance of these factors appears
different (Fig 1).8,11,13-18 Investigators from the Framingham Heart Study analyzing “factors of risk” for coronary artery disease were the ﬁrst to identify demographic and
comorbid factors independently associated with systemic
atherosclerosis.13,15 Numerous reports since have conﬁrmed
that advanced age, tobacco use, diabetes, hypertension,
and hypercholesterolemia are the primary risk factors
associated with PAD. More recent studies have identiﬁed

non-Hispanic black race,8,19 chronic renal insufﬁciency,8,20
and elevated homocysteine levels21,22 as additional factors
associated with the onset of PAD. Elevated markers of
inﬂammation, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein,
interleukin-6, ﬁbrinogen, soluble vascular cell adhesion
molecule-1, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, asymmetric dimethylarginine, b-2 macroglobulin, and cystatin C
are novel risk factors whose clinical utility for predicting
PAD onset or progression is not yet clear.23-32
2. DIAGNOSIS
Measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the
primary method for establishing the diagnosis of PAD. An
ABI of #0
