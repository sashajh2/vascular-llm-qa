, bone, and vascular structures
simultaneously. It is also able to evaluate the extent of vessel
calciﬁcation, especially in the aortic arch. CTA is less likely to
overestimate the severity of carotid stenosis compared
with MRA.15,75 The requirement for radiation and the use
of contrast remain its most signiﬁcant limitations. CTA is
not appropriate for screening purposes, because of its signiﬁcant cost and the degree of radiation exposure.75
Catheter arteriography was previously considered the
reference standard in the evaluation of carotid artery stenosis, especially preoperatively before CEA.75 Because of
its invasive nature and small, but present, risk of complications, it has no role in screening for extracranial cerebrovascular disease.
Recommendation 4.3: For asymptomatic patients
who are undergoing screening for carotid artery stenosis, we recommend duplex ultrasound performed in an
accredited vascular laboratory as the imaging modality of choice instead of CTA, MRA, or other imaging modalities (grade 1B).

Evidence and rationale
The recommendation for staged or synchronous carotid interventions in patients with 50% to 99% stenosis
and a history of stroke or TIA in the preceding 6 months
who require CABG is supported by the reported
data.128-133 However, the optimal timing for these interventions is unclear. In patients with severe (>70%) stenosis and symptomatic disease, minimal studies have
addressed the timing of the interventions.134 In an analysis of multiple observational studies
