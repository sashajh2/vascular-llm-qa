 two RCTs had an intermediate risk of bias. The studies
reported on 281 patients (mean age, 49.6 years; 68.4%
women) with CEAP class C2 to C6. One of the RCTs43,53
(HELP-2 [The Hull Endovenous Laser Project 2]) demonstrated that, when compared with EVLA, HL/S was associated with lower anatomic closure rates at one month
and an increased risk of minor sensory disturbance (RR,
0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.89; and RR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.23-9.94,

respectively). There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between the two groups regarding QoL scores,
recurrent varicosity, pigmentation, repeat intervention,
minor AEs, or serious AEs. Another RCT52 demonstrated
that HL/S was associated with lower anatomic
closure rates at 6 weeks (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58-0.90).
Anatomic closure failure was described in Roopram et al52
as 21% procedure failure/residual incompetence of the
SPJ in the HL/S group compared with 0.9% in the laser
group. HL/S was associated with an increased risk of
recurrent incompetence at 6 weeks, neurologic symptoms at 6 weeks, and surgical site infection (RR, 18.47; 95%
CI, 1.01-337.22; RR, 4.73; 95% CI, 2.06-10.85; and RR, 26.67;
95% CI, 1.53-465.40, respectively). HL/S was associated with
a lower risk of skin burn (RR, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.00-0.51). There
were no signiﬁcant differences for outcomes such as DVT
