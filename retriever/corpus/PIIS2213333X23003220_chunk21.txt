aries or limited
involvement of the GSV, we suggest phlebectomy as a safe alternative.

Consensus statement
12.1.5.

In patients with saphenous thrombophlebitis, ablation should be performed once the inﬂammation has resolved if there is
evidence of pathologic reﬂux on DUS.
13. Management of bleeding varicose veins

Consensus statements
13.1.

For patients presenting with acute bleeding from varicose veins, leg elevation,
direct compression, and sclerotherapy should be attempted before suture ligation
to control bleeding.

13.2.

For patients with bleeding due to varicose veins, prompt referral to a venous
specialist should be done.

13.3.

For patients who presented with bleeding from varicose veins, after the bleeding
has been controlled, evaluation for superﬁcial venous incompetence and
appropriate intervention on the responsible veins should be done to control venous
hypertension and reduce the risk of recurrent hemorrhage.

13.4.

Patients with varicose veins or venous ulcerations should be counseled on the
possibility of venous bleeding and their families, caregivers, or friends educated
regarding leg elevation and simple compression techniques to control severe
bleeding.
14. Management of superﬁcial vein aneurysms

Consensus statements
14.1.

For patients with superﬁcial truncal vein aneurysm, located within 3 cm of the SFJ
or SPJ, open surgical excision, with high proximal and distal ligations should be
performed. If symptomatic saphenous reﬂux is present, endovenous or open
surgical ablation (phlebectomy or limited stripping) of the distal saphenous vein
should be performed.

14.2.

For patients with an asymptomatic superﬁcial truncal vein aneurysm, located
>3 cm distal to the SFJ, endovenous ablation alone should be performed.
Thromboprophylaxis in these patients reduces the risk of VTE.

14.3.

Patients with symptomatic, thrombosed or large (>3 cm) aneurysms in the
superﬁcial veins are best treated with surgical
