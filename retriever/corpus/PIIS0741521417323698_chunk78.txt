 of the same risk factors
for mortality that had been previously identiﬁed among
patients undergoing open repair, including age, renal
failure, congestive heart failure, peripheral artery disease,
and liver disease.306 They found that only 3.4% of Medicare patients undergoing EVAR had an operative risk
>5%, but a subset, which represented <1% of patients
undergoing EVAR, was identiﬁed with a predicted mortality of >10%. In an analysis of Medicare patients undergoing open repair and EVAR, including a review of prior
Medicare claims data to obtain a reliable assessment of
pre-existing comorbidities, Giles and colleagues found
age, renal failure, heart failure, female sex, and peripheral
or cerebral vascular disease to be predictive of perioperative mortality for either EVAR or open aneurysm repair
(C statistic, 0.726).307 For the ﬁrst time, a single scoring
scheme was developed that could be applied to patients
to assess risk for either EVAR or OSR. Recently, Eslami
and collaborators used the Vascular Study Group of
New England database to develop a new risk model
that included anatomic features, such as aneurysm
diameter, neck length, and level of clamp placement,
that had not been incorporated in prior scoring schemes
(C statistic, 0.822; Table VI, A and B).308 This model has
since been validated using the VQI database and has
been recently endorsed by the VQI for risk stratiﬁcation
of patients under consideration for planned open repair
or EVAR.
The delivery of clinically appropriate care requires
balancing operative risk with the likelihood of late survival. Patients with aortic aneurysms suffer higher rates
of heart attacks, strokes, and major amputation and
have an increase in 5-year mortality compared with
age-matched controls.84 Bahia and colleagues recently
conducted a systematic review of long-term survival after
aneurysm repair.84 Patients with large aneurysms, at
greatest risk of rupture, also had signiﬁcantly worse 5year survival. As one would anticipate, many of the
same risk factors for perioperative death also have an
impact on life expectancy. One-year survival after hospital admission for heart failure is
