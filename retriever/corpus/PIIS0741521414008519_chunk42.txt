edema, skin changes, and VLUs. Failure for recanalization is a risk for development of PTS. When the mean
lysis time was reduced, the risk of reﬂux was signiﬁcantly reduced, especially in the femoral, popliteal,
and deep femoral veins, a critical parameter for preserving valve function.49 From a basic science perspective,
venous thrombosis and resolution involve important
factors including microparticles, P-selectin, coagulation
cascade and ﬁbrin, macrophages, adhesion molecules,
vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), inﬂammatory cytokines and interleukins, chemokines, plasmin, and plasminogen activators
and inhibitors, all of which affect the vein wall and its
compliance, including valvular function.50,51
Several epidemiologic studies have assessed the associated risk factors. Certainly, genetic and environmental
factors inﬂuence the predisposition to and perpetuation
of primary venous disease. Some important observations

are a family history, female gender, pregnancy, estrogen,
prolonged standing, sitting postures, and obesity. Genetic
conditions, such as Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome, cerebral
autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts
and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and FOXC2 gene
mutations, desmulin dysregulation, and Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome, display early
