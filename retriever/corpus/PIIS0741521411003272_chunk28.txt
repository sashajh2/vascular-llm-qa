been 500 ms.81 International consensus documents previously recommended 0.5 seconds as a cutoff value for all
veins to use for lower limb venous incompetence.5,22,86
This value is, however, longer, 1 second, for the femoral
and popliteal veins.81 For the perforating veins, cutoff

values of both 350 ms and 500 ms have been suggested.5,81
The Committee recommends 500 ms as the cutoff value for
saphenous, tibial, deep femoral, and perforating vein incompetence, and 1 second for femoral and popliteal vein
incompetence.
Perforating veins have been evaluated in patients with
advanced disease, usually in those with healed or active
venous ulcers (CEAP class C5-C6) or in those with recurrent varicose veins after previous interventions. The diameter of clinically relevant “pathologic” perforators (eg, beneath healed or open venous ulcer) may predict valve
incompetence. In a study by Labrapoulos et al,87 a perforator vein diameter ⬎3.9 mm had a high specificity (96%)
but a low sensitivity (73%) to predict incompetence, given
that almost one-third of the incompetent perforators had a
diameter of ⬍3.9 mm.87,88 Sandri et al,89 however, found
that a perforator diameter of ⱖ3.5 mm was associated with
reflux in ⬎90% of cases. The SVS/AVF Guideline Committee definition of “pathologic” perforating veins includes
those with outward flow of ⱖ500 ms, with a diameter of
ⱖ3.5 mm, located beneath a healed or open venous ulcer
(CEAP class C5-C6).5,81,88,89
Duplex findings in CVD. A duplex evaluation of
patients with CVD demonstrated that superficial vein reflux
was present in 90% and that 70% to 80% have reflux in the
GSV.
