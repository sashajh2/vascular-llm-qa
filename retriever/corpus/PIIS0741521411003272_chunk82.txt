ists.
We suggest preservation of the saphenous vein using the ambulatory selective
varicose vein ablation under local anesthesia (ASVAL) procedure only selectively
in patients with varicose veins.
We recommend ambulatory phlebectomy for treatment of varicose veins,
performed with saphenous vein ablation, either during the same procedure or at
a later stage. If general anesthesia is required for phlebectomy, we suggest
concomitant saphenous ablation.
We suggest transilluminated powered phlebectomy using lower oscillation speeds
and extended tumescence as an alternative to traditional phlebectomy for
extensive varicose veins.
For treatment of recurrent varicose veins, we suggest ligation of the saphenous
stump, ambulatory phlebectomy, sclerotherapy, or endovenous thermal ablation,
depending on the etiology, source, location, and extent of varicosity.
