 Almeida et al286 randomized 87
limbs to treatment with RF catheter or 980-nm EVLA.
There were no major complications. All scores referable
to pain, ecchymosis, and tenderness were statistically
lower in the catheter group at 48 hours, 1 week, and 2
weeks. Minor complications were more prevalent in the
EVLA group (P ⫽ .02). VCSS and QOL measures were
lower in the catheter group at all evaluations.286
In a similar trial, Shepherd et al285 randomized 131
patients to treatment with a new-generation RF catheter or
980-nm EVLA. Perioperative pain was less after RFA than
after laser, but clinical and QOL improvements were similar
in both groups at 6 weeks.
A recent RCT by Gale et al284 compared results of
810-nm wavelength laser with RFA. All veins were closed at
1 week after the procedure. The recanalization rate at 1 year
was significantly higher in the RF group (ClosureFAST
system) than after laser (11 of 48 vs 2 of 46, P ⫽ .002). The
mean VCSS score change from baseline to 1 week postpro-

cedure was higher for RFA than EVLA (P ⫽ .002), but
there was no difference between groups at 1 month (P ⫽
.07) and 1 year (P ⫽ .9). The authors concluded that both
methods of endovenous ablation effectively reduce symptoms of superficial venous insufficiency. EVLA was associated with greater bruising and discomfort in the perioperative period but may provide a more secure long-term
closure than RFA.
The Committee noted that the data support less bruising and less pain with the new RF catheter system than with
the 980-nm EVLA. However, further trials with higherwavelength EVLA, as well as with long-term follow-up, are
needed before any conclusion on the use of any EVLA vs
RFA can be made.
