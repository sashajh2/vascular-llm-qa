however, reﬂux from primary venous disease has a much
higher prevalence in patients presenting with the different
stages of CVD, which might also include venous ulcers.
However, obstruction from secondary venous disease
and valvular reﬂux are associated with a much more rapid
progression of disease and a higher rate of progression to
venous ulceration.40-44 Whether reﬂux or obstruction is
the cause of the patient’s clinical presentation and symptoms is unclear; both conditions lead to increased ambulatory venous pressure. The fundamental basis for CVD
and venous ulceration is inﬂammation within the venous
circulation that is subjected to increased hydrostatic pressure resulting in increased ambulatory venous pressure.45
The inﬂammation involves leukocytes (in particular

macrophages and monocytes), inﬂammatory modulators
and chemokines, cytokine expression, growth factors,
metalloproteinase activity, and many regulatory pathways
that perpetuate inﬂammation.46-48
The pathophysiologic process of primary venous
disease is a complex entity with multifaceted stages
leading to the dilated tortuous, valve-insufﬁcient varicose veins, venous hypertension, and the associated
clinical manifestations seen with CVD. The pathophysiologic mechanism of secondary venous disease involves
inﬂammation, thrombosis, recanalization resulting in
