agonists with hypotension on induction of anesthesia,
these medications should be held the morning of
surgery and restarted after the patient is euvolemic.122,123
Whereas the administration of many agents has been
evaluated, none have proved of value in limiting renal
injury after AAA repair. Antioxidants, such as mannitol,
before or during OSR have demonstrated no beneﬁt.124
Likewise, fenoldopam, dopamine, atrial natriuretic peptide, diuretics, and antiplatelet and anti-inﬂammatory
agents are of no value in the prevention or treatment
of acute kidney injury.125 Last, remote ischemic preconditioning has been studied as a strategy for reducing the
risk of renal dysfunction. However, systematic review
and meta-analysis of the current literature do not
conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of this technique in patients undergoing major vascular surgery.126-129
CIN is deﬁned as a 25% increase in serum creatinine
concentration or an absolute increase of 0.5 mg/dL 2 to
7 days after administration of contrast material. Patients
with renal disease (eGFR # 45 mL/min/1.73 m2), diabetes,
congestive heart failure, ejection fraction <40%, hypertension, anemia, advanced age, proteinuria, and gout
are at increased risk for CIN.130 Gadolinium is not a safe
alternative to iodinated contrast agents, given the risk
for nephrogenic systemic ﬁbrosis in patients with a GFR
of <30 mL/min/1.73 m2.
There is a linear relationship between the volume of
contrast material administered and the onset and
severity of CIN. For every 100 mL of contrast material
infused during coronary artery interventions, there is a
12% increase in the risk for CIN.131 Preprocedural hydration may be beneﬁcial, but fenoldopam, dopamine, atrial
natriuretic peptide, theophylline, and calcium channel
blockers are not.132 Preprocedural administration of oral
N-acetylcysteine is recommended for at-risk patients,
given its low cost, safety proﬁ
