complications. Current rapid-exchange stent platforms work
over the 0.014-inch wires of the EPDs. Self-expanding nitinol
stents are preferred; open and closed cell designs, as well as
tubular and tapered shapes have been approved for use in
the US. Reliable comparative studies are still required to
guide selection of one stent design over the other.
Post-stenting angioplasty is performed with a balloon
undersized by 20% to 40% of CA diameter and the stent
length. A moderate residual stenosis (20% to 30%) is generally acceptable since continued expansion of nitinol stents

In asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid
stenosis (â±–60%), we recommend carotid endarterectomy plus
medical management as long as perioperative risk is low.
(GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence).

including trial-eligible patients cared for in centers with not
as good surgical outcomes, requires judgment that considers the potential benefits and harms of the alternative
courses of action as well as the values and preferences of the
patient and their clinical circumstances; if applying our
recommendations to these contexts, clinicians should consider these as suggestions (GRADE 2). Similarly, newer
medical therapies (statins, more potent antiplatelet agents,
and improved management for diabetes and hypertension)
might favorably alter the outcome of medical management
sufficiently to diminish the strength of this recommendation. Newer therapies were included in ACST and their use
in that study did not result in a diminution of the benefit of
endarterectomy from that seen in ACAS.
