however, suggest that laser light with longer wavelengths
(1320-nm Nd:YAG laser, 1470-nm diode laser) may reduce adverse effects without compromising abolition of
reflux.
Another recent development is the introduction of the
ELVeS Radial Fiber, a fiber with a radial emitting laser tip
(Biolitec AG, Jena, Germany), which may decrease the
amount of energy required to occlude the vein, thus decreasing pain and adverse effects of thermal ablations. A

Gloviczki et al 29S

RCT by Doganci and Demirkilic270 compared early occlusion rates of two different laser fibers. The immediate
occlusion rate was 100% for both the 980-nm laser and
bare-tip fiber and the 1470-nm laser with the radial fiber.
Other clinical trials with such fibers are under way.
EVLA vs high ligation, division, and stripping. Seven
RCTs250,265,271-275 compared results of laser ablation with
open high ligation, division, and saphenous stripping. An
RCT by Rasmussen et al265 found no difference in shortterm safety and efficacy or early QOL between EVLA using
a wavelength of 980 nm and HL/S, but EVLA was more
expensive than open surgery. The recurrence rate of varicose veins at 2 years was 33% after high ligation and 26%
after EVLA (P ⫽ NS).177 The study concluded that treatments were equally safe and efficient in eliminating saphenous reflux, alleviating symptoms and signs of varicose
veins, and improving QOL.
Darwood et al271 performed an RCT comparing EVLA
with surgery for treatment of primary varicosity and saphenous incompetence. EVLA and surgery were comparable in
ablation of reflux and in disease-specific QOL, but return to
normal activity averaged a median of 2 days (range, 0-7
days) after EVLA vs 7 days (range, 2-26 days) after surgical
treatment (P ⫽ .00
