 imaging study
reveals a signiﬁcant technical deﬁcit, the endarterectomy
site itself must be reexplored.417 The distal ICA should not be
clamped initially to appropriately perform repeat thromboendarterectomy without causing fracturing and intracerebral embolization of any local thrombus or debris. The
clot is carefully extracted with the hope that existing
backpressure will help to achieve complete removal of the
existing thrombus from the cervical ICA. If there is no back
bleeding, gentle meticulous balloon catheter thrombectomy can be performed, but there is a risk of causing a
carotid-cavernous sinus ﬁstula.419 Once thrombus has been
extracted and back bleeding occurs, the ICA can be safely
clamped. The endarterectomy site must be meticulously
inspected for any technical deﬁcits that may have caused
the thrombosis or embolization and these should be
repaired as necessary.358,417,418 Most surgeons recommend
shunt insertion during reexploration for a perioperative
stroke to limit the ischemic event during repair, but this
must be done extremely carefully under direct
visualization.358

If no defect or thrombosis is noted at the endarterectomy site, the stroke is likely related to either ischemia
that occurred while the carotid artery was clamped or
intraoperative embolization during the dissection. Intraoperative arteriography may demonstrate an intracerebral embolus. Catheter-directed thrombolysis or other
neurologic rescue techniques can be used to salvage
these situations and restore ﬂow to the intracerebral vessels. However, if the ICA seems to be normal at reexploration, and no large intracerebral embolus can be
identiﬁed, this ﬁnding suggests that the patient may
have experienced either embolization before carotid
clamping or sustained a signiﬁcant period of ischemia
during the clamping period. These etiologies may not
be formally treatable with surgical or endovascular techniques. Therefore, treatment is primarily medical,
including supportive care, hemodynamic monitoring,
and anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents as deemed
clinically appropriate.
