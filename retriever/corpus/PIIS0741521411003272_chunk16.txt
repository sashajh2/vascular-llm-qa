hypertension initiates a series of changes in the subcutaneous tissue and the skin: activation of the endothelial
cells, extravasation of macromolecules and red blood
cells, diapedesis of leukocytes, tissue edema, and chronic
inflammatory changes most frequently noted at and
above the ankles.41,53 Limb swelling, pigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis, eczema, or venous ulcerations can
develop in these patients.
THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM
In the adult Western population, the prevalence of
varicose veins is ⬎20% (range, 21.8%-29.4%), and about 5%
(range, 3.6%-8.6%) have venous edema, skin changes or
venous ulcerations. Active venous ulcers are present in up
to 0.5%, and between 0.6% and 1.4% have healed ulcers.57
On the basis of estimates of the San Diego epidemiologic
study, more than 11 million men and 22 million women
between the ages of 40 and 80 years in the United States
have varicose veins, and ⬎2 million adults have advanced

CVD, with skin changes or ulcers.1 The incidence of postthrombotic venous ulcers has not changed in the past 2
decades for women, and it recently increased in men.58 In
the United States each year, at least 20,556 patients receive
a new diagnosis of venous ulcers.3
The Bonn Vein Study,59 which enrolled 3072 randomly selected participants (1722 women and 1350 men),
aged from 18 to 79 years, found symptoms of CVD in
49.1% of men and in 62.1% of women. Also reported were
varicose veins without edema or skin changes in 14.3%
(12.4% men, 15.8% women), edema in 13.4% (11.6% men,
14.9% women), skin changes in 2.9% (3.1% men, 2.
