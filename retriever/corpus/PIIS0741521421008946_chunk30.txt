-0.81; P < .001). Moderate or severe hemorrhage occurred in seven patients (0.3%) in the

clopidogrel-aspirin group and in eight (0.3%) in the aspirin
group (P ¼ .73) and the rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.3%
in each group.135 A subsequent meta-analysis assessed trials including the following regimens: Aspirin þ clopidogrel
vs aspirin; aspirin þ clopidogrel vs clopidogrel; aspirin þ
dipyridamole vs aspirin; aspirin þ dipyridamole vs dipyridamole; aspirin þ dipyridamole vs clopidogrel; and
cilostazol þ aspirin vs aspirin. This meta-analysis concluded
that dual antiplatelet therapy was associated with a 31%
relative risk reduction in stroke incidence compared with
monotherapy.136 Finally, consistent with recognition that
plaque instability is greatest early after an ischemic event,
dual antiplatelet therapy appears clinically beneﬁcial in
the early weeks following these events. A meta-analysis of
eight randomized clinical trials including 20,728 patients
demonstrated that short-term (<3 months) dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel compared with
aspirin alone signiﬁcantly decreased risk of recurrent stroke
but it did not increase risk of hemorrhagic complications.
Relative to monotherapy with aspirin, dual therapy with
aspirin and clopidogrel reduced risk of stroke recurrence
(RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.59-0.81; P < .01) and did not increase
the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.50-3.04;
P ¼ .65) or major bleeding events (RR, 2.17; 95% CI, 0.1825.71; P ¼ .54). However, short-term combination therapy
was associated with a signiﬁcantly lower risk of major
vascular events (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.69
