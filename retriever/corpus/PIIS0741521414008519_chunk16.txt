 Venous Reﬂux With Skin Changes at Risk for Venous Leg Ulcer (C4b), Healed (C5) or
Active (C6) Venous Leg UlcerdLigation
In a patient with infrainguinal deep venous reﬂux and skin changes at risk for venous leg ulcer (C4b), healed
venous leg ulcer (C5), or active venous leg ulcer (C6), we suggest against deep vein ligation of the femoral or popliteal veins as a routine treatment. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 6.11: Deep Venous Reﬂux With Skin Changes at Risk for Venous Leg Ulcer (C4b), Healed (C5) or
Active (C6) Venous Leg UlcerdPrimary Valve Repair
In a patient with infrainguinal deep venous reﬂux and skin changes at risk for venous leg ulcer (C4b), healed
venous leg ulcer (C5), or active venous leg ulcer (C6), we suggest individual valve repair for those who have axial
reﬂux with structurally preserved deep venous valves in addition to standard compression therapy to aid in venous
ulcer healing and to prevent recurrence. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 6.12: Deep Venous Reﬂux With Skin Changes at Risk for Venous Leg Ulcer (C4b), Healed (C5) or
Active (C6) Venous Leg UlcerdValve Transposition or Transplantation
In a patient with infrainguinal deep venous reﬂux and skin changes at risk for venous leg ulcer (C4b), healed
venous leg ulcer (C5), or active venous leg ulcer (C6), we suggest valve transposition or transplantation for those
with absence of structurally preserved axial deep venous valves when competent outﬂow venous pathways are
anatomically appropriate for surgical anastomosis in addition to standard compression therapy to aid in venous
leg ulcer healing and to prevent recurrence. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
