 the GSV of >500 ms).
One study24 had an intermediate risk of bias,
compared DUS with HHD examination (deﬁned as
continuous wave Doppler only with no color or gray
scale imaging or use of pulsed Doppler examination).
The study demonstrated that the sensitivity of the
HHD technique was 73% at the SFJ, 77% at the SPJ,
and 51% for thigh perforators. In primary varicose veins,
surgical treatment planned using HHD examination
alone would have left residual sites of reﬂux in 24%.
The study concluded that examination with HHD examination is not sufﬁciently accurate to plan varicose vein
surgery and suggested the need for duplex scanning.24
The second prospective study25 had a low risk of bias
and compared DUS with HHD examination complemented by physical examination. The study demonstrated that the accuracy of HHD was 71% at the SFJ
and in the GSV (previously called the long saphenous
vein). However, in 90% of limbs, duplex scanning did
not affect surgical management (Supplementary
Table IV, online only).
Key Question 2. Surgical stripping vs endovenous ablation by any technique
We included 30 RCTs (44 publications)26-60,100-108
enrolling 5610 patients, and 16 comparative observational
studies61-73,109-111 enrolling 3220 patients. Nineteen RCTs
(32
publications)26-29,34,35,38,43-57,59,100-108
had
an
intermediate overall risk of bias; 8 RCTs (9
publications)30,31,33,37,39-41,58,60 had a high risk of bias mainly
owing to inadequate randomization, inadequate random
sequence generation, allocation concealment, unclear
blinding of outcome assessors, possible selective reporting,
and other sources of bias such as funding sources; 3
RCTs32,36,42 had a low risk of bias
