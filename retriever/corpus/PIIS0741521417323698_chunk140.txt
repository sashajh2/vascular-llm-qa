and coworkers reported a nearly identical 2-year incidence of graft infection (<0.2%) for OSR or EVAR in a
review of 14,000 patients undergoing aneurysm repair.693
Graft infection after EVAR or open repair may occur in
isolation or with an aortoenteric ﬁstula.694,695
Whereas aortic graft infection presents on average 3
years or later after open repair, endograft infection often

is manifested earlier for reasons that remain unclear.681,696,697 Femoral artery extension of a prosthesis increases the incidence of graft infection from 1% to 3%.698
Other predisposing factors for graft infection include the
need for surgical revision and emergent indication for
initial surgery. Generalized sepsis, groin drainage, pseudoaneurysm formation, and ill-deﬁned pain may be presenting symptoms, and staphylococcal organisms are
the most frequent isolates.699 CT imaging may provide
an initial estimate of the extent of infection, determine
if a pseudoaneurysm exists at the proximal anastomosis,
and assist in operative planning for effective revascularization of the lower extremities.
The conventional treatment of graft infection is staged
excision of all infected graft material with extra-anatomic
reconstruction, particularly in the presence of extensive
contamination and gross purulence.681,700-704 In situ
reconstruction using the femoral vein, a silver- or
antibiotic-impregnated graft, or a cryopreserved allograft
represents an additional surgical option, particularly
appropriate in the presence of minimal contamination.
Placement of a silver or antibiotic prosthetic or PTFE
graft in a grossly contaminated ﬁeld is reserved for the
unstable patient.700,705-709
Treatment of an endograft infection poses unique challenges. A dense inﬂammatory reaction can completely
obliterate natural tissue planes, and endograft hooks or
suprarenal ﬁxation may dictate the need for supraceliac
cross-clamping to explant the device. Furthermore,
hooks and the suprarenal segment may be embedded
into the aortic wall or covered with
