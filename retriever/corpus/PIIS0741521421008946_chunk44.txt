 of CCA which make access difﬁcult are also relative contraindications.177,178
Lesion morphology
Lesion morphology such as echolucency, calciﬁcation,
long irregular plaques, the presence of fresh thrombus
or a string sign can affect outcomes and alter decision
making concerning carotid revascularization.172,175 This
section examines the impact of lesion morphology on
outcome following carotid revascularization techniques.

High risk for CEA. Lesion-speciﬁc morphology generally
does not have a signiﬁcant impact on CEA outcome. The
degree of lesion calciﬁcation, echolucency, and the presence of fresh thrombus have not been shown to impact
risk of neurologic events following CEA as these lesions
can be removed en bloc. Long complex lesions can also
be treated with no increase in complication if they do
not extend above the lower endplate of the C2 vertebral
body. The presence of a carotid string sign in which the
extra and intracranial ICA is diminutive may be a relative
contraindication. In most instances the carotid artery is
small because it is under pressurized, and patients with
a proximal ICA atherosclerotic lesion can be treated
safely.179 However, it is important to acknowledge that
there is little clinical evidence guiding treatment indications for patients with a carotid string sign, nor is there
guidance on whether CEA or carotid stenting are equally
effective in this setting. In a small series of patients undergoing intervention, the 30-day stroke risk for CEA was
2.1% vs 2.4% for CAS. Restenosis risk was 5% for both
groups over 1 to 5 years of follow-up.180
High risk for transfemoral CAS. Lesion morphology
has a signiﬁcant impact on outcomes for patients undergoing transfemoral CAS. Very tight stenosis, irregular
calciﬁed stenosis, and long lesions can limit the ability
to deliver the stent across the lesion.172,175 Carotid
bifurcation stent placement in heavily or circumferentially calciﬁed lesions has been associated with a
