of IC.
5.20. We recommend against EVT of isolated infrapopliteal disease for IC because this treatment is of
unproven beneﬁt and possibly harmful.
5.21. We recommend surgical bypass as an initial revascularization strategy for patients with diffuse FP
disease, small caliber (<5 mm), or extensive calciﬁcation of the SFA, if they have favorable
anatomy for bypass (popliteal artery target, good runoff) and have average or low operative
risk.
5.22. We recommend using the saphenous vein as the preferred conduit for infrainguinal bypass grafts.
5.23. In the absence of suitable vein, we suggest using prosthetic conduit for FP bypass in claudicant patients,
if the above-knee popliteal artery is the target vessel and good runoff is present.
EVT, Endovascular therapy; SFA, superﬁcial femoral artery.

Quality of evidence

EVT was associated with lower 30-day C (risk of bias, indirectness
morbidity (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.34- because most trials
enrolled CLI patients)
6.41) and higher technical failure
(OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.05-0.22) than
bypass surgery. No difference in 30day mortality (OR, 0.92; 95% CI,
0.55-1.51). Higher primary patency
in the surgical treatment arm was
found at 1 (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.374.28), 2 (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.203.4
