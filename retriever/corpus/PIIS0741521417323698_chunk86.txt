 underscoring the difﬁculty of
causal association in the setting of signiﬁcant comorbidities present in the older patient demographic at
risk for AAA disease.347 Several endovascular techniques have been described to preserve internal iliac
artery ﬂow, including the development of commercially
available aortoiliac endografts that incorporate an iliac
branch.348-351

We recommend preservation of ﬂow to at least one internal
iliac artery.
Level of recommendation

1 (Strong)

We suggest renal artery or SMA angioplasty and stenting for
selected patients with symptomatic disease before EVAR or
OSR.

Quality of evidence

A (High)

Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

We recommend using FDA-approved branch endograft
devices in anatomically suitable patients to maintain
perfusion to at least one internal iliac artery.
Level of recommendation

1 (Strong)

Quality of evidence

A (High)

We recommend staging bilateral internal iliac artery occlusion
by at least 1 to 2 weeks if required for EVAR.

Management of associated vascular disease. Coexistence of other vascular disease with an AAA is common.
Several series reporting observations of aortography have
documented >50% stenosis in 20% to 40% of renal arteries, 10% to 15% of celiac or superior mesenteric
branches, and 20% to 30% of iliac vessels.352,353
The decision to intervene is based on a consideration
of severity of associated lesions, presumed natural history of the diseased vessel and end organ, and anticipated morbidity and mortality risk of combined
repair. Prophylactic treatment of associated asymptomatic renal or mesenteric artery disease cannot be justiﬁed.354,355 The exception may be the patient presenting
with high-grade stenosis of the SMA and a meandering
mesenteric artery that is based off of a large IMA,
which will be sacriﬁced during the course of treatment.
