. CEA or TCAR may be
preferable in situations where ipsilateral tissue planes
remain relatively intact (Table II).
5. TCAR is preferred over CEA and transfemoral CAS in
symptomatic patients with 50% or greater stenosis
and lesion above C2 (Table II).

6. TCAR is preferred over CEA and transfemoral CAS in
high
surgical
risk
(both
anatomically
and
physiologically).
7. CAS is preferred over CEA in symptomatic patients
with 50% or greater stenosis and severe uncorrectable coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The
committee recognized the difﬁculty in clearly
deﬁning this group of individuals, both in symptomatology and risk assessment, and acknowledged the
potential increased role of aggressive medical management as primary therapy in this high-risk group
(Table II).
8. Neurologically asymptomatic patients deemed high
risk for CEA, TCAR, and transfemoral CAS should be
considered for primary medical management. Intervention can be considered in these patients only
with evidence that perioperative morbidity and mortality is less than 3%. CAS should not be performed
in these patients except as part of an ongoing clinical
trial.
9. There are insufﬁcient data to recommend transfemoral CAS as primary therapy
