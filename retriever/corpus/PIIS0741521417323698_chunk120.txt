Since 2013, an additional 53 patients presenting with an
aortocaval ﬁstula have been added to the previously
reported 250 cases.547 The majority have been successfully treated with EVAR alone, with occasional use of an
Amplatzer plug548 or additional placement of a covered
stent in the inferior vena cava.549-552

ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS AND
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT
Choice of anesthetic technique and agent. Open
aneurysm repair requires general anesthesia, except in
unusual circumstances, because of the required relaxation of the abdominal wall musculature and need for
wide exposure of the aorta and its branches.553 Insertion of monitoring lines before induction of anesthesia is
appropriate if such monitoring devices improve the
safety of induction. Infusion of an analgesic through an
epidural catheter, by controlling pain ﬁber input, appears
to lower the required dose of general anesthetic agents
and may be associated with a shorter time to extubation.554 In addition, it has been postulated but not proven
that there is decreased hemodynamic lability and cardiac ischemia.555,556 Nonetheless, it has been difﬁcult to
demonstrate signiﬁcant beneﬁt to either intraoperative
or postoperative epidural anesthesia, and traumatic
preoperative insertion of an epidural catheter with
blood-tinged cerebrospinal ﬂuid may preclude subsequent heparin administration and require cancellation of
the operative procedure. Use of epidural anesthesia with
low-dose inhalation anesthesia or in the awake patient
has been advocated for patients with severe COPD.557-559
EVAR can be safely performed under general, epidural,
or local anesthesia. Whereas a number of retrospective
studies suggest that the type of anesthetic inﬂuences
operative time, length of hospital stay, and risk of
morbidity, a mortality beneﬁt has yet to be identiﬁed.
In a retrospective analysis of nearly 4000 patients in the
EUROSTAR registry, local anesthesia was associated
with shorter operative times, reduced ICU admission,
shorter hospital stay, and fewer systemic complications.56
