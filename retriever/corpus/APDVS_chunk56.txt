Discussion: Performing an ankle-brachial index (ABI) requires an appropriately sized
manual blood pressure cuff and a hand-held, continuous-wave Doppler probe. The patient
should be in the supine position and allowed to rest before the examination begins. The
blood pressure cuff is placed above the ankle. The Doppler probe is used to locate the
dorsalis pedis (DP) or posterior tibial (PT) pulse. The pressure cuff is infated until the
Doppler signal is obliterated, and then the cuff is then slowly released. The pressure at
which the Doppler signal returns is the ankle pressure. The same process is repeated for
both legs (DP and PT signals) and both arms. The arm pressure must be measured with
the Doppler probe and the manual blood pressure cuff. To calculate an ABI, the higher
ankle pressure (DP or PT) is divided by the highest arm pressure (left or right). Note
that the higher arm pressure is used to calculate the ABI for both legs. For this specific

90

case, the highest arm pressure is 150. To calculate on the right, 165/150=1.1, on the
left 120/150=0.8. A normal ABI is 0.9 to 1.2. Patients with claudication usually have
an ABI ranging from 0.5 to 0.9, and those with ischemic rest pain or tissue loss usually
have an ABI less than 0.5. Sabiston Textbook of Surgery: The Biological Basis of Modern
