 causes claudication
ABI <0.5: often causes ischemic rest pain/tissue loss
Below, we will review how to calculate the ABI for the right and left lower extremity using
the following values:
Artery

Pressure (mm Hg)

Brachial
Dorsalis pedis (DP)
Posterior tibial (PT)

Right
150
145
150

Left
130
120
110

For both right and left lower extremities, the highest brachial pressure is 150 and will be used
for comparison for the ankle/brachial index.
On the right lower extremity, using the DP systolic pressure the ABI is 145/150 = 0.97 and
using the PT systolic pressure the ABI = 150/150 = 1.0. So the Right ABI is 1.0, because we
choose the highest of the two ankle pressures for the final value of the ABI.
On the left lower extremity, using the DP systolic pressure the ABI is 120/150 = 0.8 and using
the PT systolic pressure the ABI = 110/150 = 0.73. So the Left ABI is 0.8, because we choose
the highest of the two ankle pressures for the final value of the ABI.
For this above example, R ABI = 1.0 and L ABI = 0.8. So this patient may have some
peripheral vascular disease present in his left lower extremity as his ABI is less than 0.9.

Pulse volume recordings (PVR)
Pulse volume recordings (PVR) use pressure cuffs to record the shape of a pulse. The type
of waveform provides important information about the characteristics of blood fow. These
waveforms can be categorized as triphasic, bisphasic, or monophasic. Clinicians use these
waveform patterns to diagnose and monitor arterial diseases, assess the severity of stenosis,
and determine the effectiveness of treatment interventions.
