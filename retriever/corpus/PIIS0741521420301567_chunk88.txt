 GDAA or PDAA with aneurysms outside the visceral circulation. Therefore,
screening for concomitant aneurysms outside the
abdomen is of little value.
It is well known that endovascular treatment of GDAA
and PDAA may be associated with the long-term
complication of aneurysm reperfusion.6,209 Although no
studies have evaluated the recurrence rates of GDAA or
PDAA after endovascular coiling, recanalization after
endovascular treatment of visceral artery aneurysms occurs in 9% to 15% of patients.111,113,190,234 This may be
due to insufﬁcient packing, long-term coil compaction,
or delayed coil migration.235,236 Thus, follow-up imaging
is crucial.59,235
A radiopaque agent is necessary for embolization; however, this creates a signiﬁcant radioartifact on follow-up
imaging.1,56 Whereas CTA is the most commonly used
follow-up study modality, certain reports have found

Recommendations for follow-up and surveillance of PDAA and GDAA patients
Recommendation
5.1

In patients status post treatment of GDAA and PDAA, we recommend follow-up
imaging after endovascular treatment of GDAA and PDAA to rule out persistent ﬂow
through the aneurysm sac.

that it cannot accurately determine reperfusion of an
aneurysm sac because of the degree of radioartifact.237
More recently, three-dimensional contrast-enhanced
MRA has been shown to be a safe and effective way to
provide postoperative follow-up.238 This technique has
a 91% accuracy in deﬁning hemodynamic status and
complications with little metallic artifact.239
Concerns about repeated radiation exposure have
prompted some to recommend duplex ultrasound as
an alternative surveillance technique.1,6,56,209 Contrastenhanced ultrasound is a less expensive and noninvasive
technique that has been shown to clearly identify ﬂow in
and around a
