4. A patient with chronic venous disease (CVD) is evaluated using the CEAP classification
system and scored as C4b. What does this classification indicate??
A. Active venous ulcer
B. Skin pigmentation or eczema
C. Lipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche
D. Telangiectasias or reticular veins
Answer
C. Lipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche.
Discussion: The CEAP classification C4b indicates the presence of lipodermatosclerosis
or atrophie blanche, which are manifestations of chronic venous disease characterized by
changes in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Options A, B, and D correspond to other
classifications within the CEAP system.
5. A patient undergoes endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) for symptomatic varicose veins.
Post-procedure, what is a potential complication that should be monitored using duplex
ultrasound?
A. Allergic reaction to the laser
B. Endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT)
C. Superficial wound infection
D. Hypotension from anesthesia
Answer
B. Endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT).
Discussion: Endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT) is a potential complication of
endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), where heat generated by the laser can extend thrombus into the deep venous system. Monitoring with duplex ultrasound post-procedure
helps detect EHIT early. Allergic reactions, superficial wound infections, and hypotension are less common complications and managed differently.

6. A patient with chronic venous disease (CVD) undergoes surgical ligation and stripping of
the great saphenous vein (GSV). What is a known advantage of this procedure compared
to endovenous ablation techniques?
A. Lower risk of procedural complications
B. Shorter recovery time
C. Less risk of recurrence
D. Suitable for patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
Answer
C. Less risk of recurrence.
Discussion: Surgical ligation and stripping of the great saphenous vein (GSV) have
been associated with lower recurrence rates compared to endovenous ablation techniques.
While endovenous ablation offers advantages such as shorter recovery times and lower
procedural complications, it
