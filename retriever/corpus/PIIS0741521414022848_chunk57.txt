Prosthetic grafts (Dacron, expanded polytetraﬂuoroethylene [ePTFE]) are typically used for AFB and IFB
and have excellent durability. Small graft sizes (eg, 12 
6 mm) have been associated with decreased patency and
should be avoided.180 In the special circumstance of
infected or contaminated ﬁelds, or removal of a previous
infected graft, autogenous and cryopreserved conduits (artery or vein) have been used with good success.
Perioperative mortality for these procedures is
generally <3%,181 although morbidity may include cardiac,
pulmonary, infectious, wound, and gastrointestinal complications in 10% to 15%. Patency rates for AFB, aortoiliac endarterectomy, and IFB, as noted, have ranged from 80% to 90%
at 5-year and 10-year intervals.156,157,166,173,174,180,182 Functional outcomes for claudicant patients, although less
frequently reported, are generally quite good but depend on
the presence of infrainguinal disease and modiﬁcation of lifestyle and risk factors. Long-term complications include limb
occlusions, pseudoaneurysm, graft infection, and graftenteric ﬁstula. Although the overall results are excellent,
caution is warranted in certain subgroups of patients who
have demonstrated inferior outcomes, particularly younger
patients (age <50 years), hypercoagulable patients, and those
with very small-caliber outﬂow vessels.180 Younger patients
with premature AIOD are a high-risk group reﬂecting poorly
controlled risk factors, underlying genetic or biochemical predispositions, and a more aggressive vascular phenotype.183
Conservative management of younger patients with AIOD
is advocated because the initiation of surgical or endovascular
interventions at a premature age can lead to accelerated progression toward a more critical stage of disease. Furthermore,
recent data from clinical trials74 support the role of exercise
