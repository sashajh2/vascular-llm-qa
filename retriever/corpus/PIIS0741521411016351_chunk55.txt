have specifically addressed the outcome of carotid stenting
in asymptomatic patients. CAS has been applied in asymptomatic patients based on the benefit seen for CEA, with
the expectation that it would be equivalent or superior to
CEA because of its less invasive nature. Many studies of
CAS have been in the form of “high-risk” registries.96,97,163,216-219 Others, such as the Carotid and Vertebral Artery Transluminal Angioplasty Study (CAVATAS)
trial not, only had a small overall usage of stents (26%), but
only 16 of 504 patients (⬍5%) in the study population were
asymptomatic.220 A single-institution study by Brook et
al85 comparing CEA with stenting in asymptomatic patients was also limited by the small number of patients and
the lack of major postprocedural complications in either
group.221
Another trial that suffered from a limited number of
patients (⬍100 asymptomatic CAS) in addition to lack of
randomization was the Carotid Revascularization using
Endarterectomy or Stenting Systems (CaRESS) study. The
primary outcomes were not stratified according to the
presence or absence of neurologic symptoms, probably
because of the small number of enrollees. The overall
30-day composite of death/stroke/MI was not statistically
significantly different for CEA (4.4%) or for CAS (2.1%),
and noninferiority of CAS was not demonstrated by statistical methodology.222
In 2004, the Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection
in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE)
trial, which included “high-risk” patients, 70% of whom
were asymptomatic, demonstrated that the results of stenting with cerebral protection devices were not inferior to
those obtained with CEA.94 The primary end point of the
study was the 30-day cumulative incidence of death/
stroke/MI, which was 5.4% for asymptomatic patients who
underwent CAS and 10.2% for CEA (P ⫽ .20).
The critics of this study raised several
