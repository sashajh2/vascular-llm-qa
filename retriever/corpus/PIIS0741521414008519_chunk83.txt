 the patient’s or clinician’s preference, and when there are speciﬁc reasons that require
more expeditious closure. In a nonrandomized study of
111 patients, Jankunas demonstrated improved healing
and durability with skin grafting compared with conservative therapy for large venous wounds that were present
longer than 6 months,, but only 65% of cases were judged
to have good take of the split-thickness skin graft.258 Skin
grafting should be considered as primary therapy only for
large wounds (ie, >25 cm2) in which healing is unlikely
without grafting or as secondary therapy after there is a failure to achieve healing with standard of care.
Guideline 4.20: Cellular Therapy
We suggest the use of cultured allogeneic bilayer
skin replacements (with both epidermal and dermal
layers) to increase the chances for healing in patients
with difﬁcult to heal venous leg ulcers in addition to
compression therapy in patients who have failed to
show signs of healing after standard therapy for 4 to
6 weeks. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - A]
Apligraf, an allogeneic bilayer cellular therapy, has been
approved by the FDA for treatment of VLUs. The efﬁcacy
of Apligraf was studied in an RCT of 245 patients with
VLUs treated with standard of care compared with standard
of care plus the application of Apligraf.259,260 VLUs had been
present for at least 6 weeks and had not responded well to the
initial use of compression and the other aspects of standard
care. Subsequent research has identiﬁed improved outcomes
for recalcitrant VLUs (>1 year duration or large surface
area).262 No other living cellular therapies have demonstrated
beneﬁt for the treatment of VLUs in prospective RCTs.
Guideline 4.21: Preparation for Cellular Therapy
We suggest a therapeutic trial of appropriate
compression and wound bed moisture control before
application of cellular therapy. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL
OF EVIDENCE - C] We recommend that adequate
wound bed preparation, including complete removal of
slough, debris, and any necrotic tissue, be completed
before
