with EVT has lowered the threshold for invasive treatment
to include patients who were previously managed without
invasive treatment when the only option was conventional
surgery. However, there is no conclusive evidence supporting this more aggressive approach,192 especially compared
with supervised exercise.76 Treatment guidelines from the
American Heart Association43 and the revised TransAtlantic Intersociety Consensus document9 recommend
the use of EVT as a ﬁrst-line treatment for those patients
requiring invasive therapy for focal and moderate disease,
with open bypass recommended for diffuse disease or
long-segment total occlusions, or both. However, the quality of evidence of the long-term efﬁcacy of EVT compared
with open surgical bypass for the treatment of IC is low.
Consequently, the decision of which modality to use must
be individualized and should take into account other clinical
factors beyond arterial anatomy, including periprocedural
risks, availability of conduit, and anticipated risk of wound
complications. Patient preference, after full consideration
of the trade-offs, plays an important role as well.
