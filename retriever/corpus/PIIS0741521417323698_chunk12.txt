We suggest repair in women with AAA between 5.0 cm
and 5.4 cm in maximum diameter.

B (Moderate)

We suggest surveillance imaging at 12-month intervals
for patients with an AAA of 4.0 to 4.9 cm in diameter.

In patients with a small aneurysm (4.0-5.4 cm) who will
require chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or solid organ
transplantation, we suggest a shared decision-making
approach to decide about treatment options.
