approaches can be performed safely and is effective in
treating both left- and right-sided carotid lesions in patients with type III and bovine arch anatomy. These approaches are patient selective, and used based on the
operator’s experience. A preprocedural Allen’s test and
careful review of all imaging studies should be performed before considering these approaches.371 However, such access is technically difﬁcult for catheterization
of a nonbovine left ICA take-off (owing to its sharp angle)
and does not solve the problem of ostial stenosis.372
Multiple studies analyzing large cohorts demonstrate
low complication risk from radial approaches, while
others have noted beneﬁts of both radial and brachial
approaches.371,373-377 In particular, excellent results have
been achieved with right brachial approaches in patients
with left ICA lesions and bovine arch anatomy,373 and
with transradial access in patients undergoing CAS
with bovine and type III aortic arch anatomy.371 Although
some investigators have found it beneﬁcial to approach
CAS from a contralateral radial access,371 others reserve
the left radial access to treat left-sided lesions in patients
with previous debranching procedures (eg, left
common-to-subclavian bypasses, because this method
allows access to the ipsilateral ICA). The latter avoids
crossing all three great vessels and minimizes arch

manipulation; therefore, decreasing risk of embolic
events. The RADCAR (Radial access for Carotid artery
stenting) study randomized patients to transradial (n ¼
130) and transfemoral (n ¼ 130) groups and showed no
differences in major adverse events and hospitalization
between the two approaches. However, with transradial
access, crossover and radiation dose were higher. Moreover, hospitalization was shorter with transradial access
in the per-protocol analysis.378
Technique for radial/brachial approach. A micropuncture access set is used for brachial artery access, whereas a
GlidesheathÔ hydrophilic-coated nitinol micropuncture
set (Terumo Medical, Somerset, NJ), is used for radial artery
access.37
