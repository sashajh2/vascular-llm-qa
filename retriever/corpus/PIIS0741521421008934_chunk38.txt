ﬁcant carotid artery stenosis. In a reported
meta-analysis of studies describing the relationship between carotid bruit and carotid stenosis, 28 prospective
cohort studies involving >17,000 patients were
analyzed.109 The stroke rate was 1.6 per 100 patient-years
for those with bruits compared with 1.3 per 100 patientyears for those without carotid bruits. Thus, the
presence of a carotid bruit likely increases the risk of
cerebrovascular disease and, therefore, might justify
screening of otherwise asymptomatic patients.
In the Northern Manhattan study, the presence of
$60% carotid stenosis was 2.2%, and the presence of a
carotid bruit was 4.1% among 686 asymptomatic subjects.110 The positive predictive value of an ipsilateral carotid bruit was 25%, and the negative predictive value
was 99%. The sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and overall accuracy
was 56%, 98%, and 97.5%, respectively. However, in
another observational study of >1500 patients who had
undergone carotid ultrasound speciﬁcally because of
the presence of an audible bruit, 31% had had signiﬁcant
($50%) stenosis.111 However, for the patients with 50% to

99% carotid stenosis, the presence of a carotid bruit had
an accuracy of 75%, sensitivity of 71%, speciﬁcity of 81%,
and positive likelihood ratio of 3.65. Therefore, although
carotid bruits are not necessarily accurate enough to
conﬁrm or exclude the presence of signiﬁcant carotid
stenoses, these signs are thought to be an appropriate
indication for further directed screening with carotid
duplex ultrasound, especially if the carotid bruit is noted
in a patient with other atherosclerotic risk factors.
