 probe is used to assess the blood fow. The
doppler signal can be triphasic, or biphasic, or monophasic.
Doppler Signals:
 Triphasic and biphasic doppler signals indicate good blood fow.

 Monophasic signal correlates with moderate to severe decrease in arterial blood
fow.
 In severe ischemia, a soft continuous venous signal may be all that is heard.
Listen to examples of Doppler signals here.
On Exam:
 Temperature changes may help demarcate the level of disease.
 Sensory loss may be present in acute ischemia, chronic limb threatening ischemia,
and chronic neuropathy.

Head and Neck Exam:
Inspection:
 Pulsatile masses in the neck are usually tortuous carotid arteries mistaken for carotid
aneurysms. Carotid aneurysms are usually near the carotid bifurcation, while tortuous
carotid arteries are usually at the base of the neck. Carotid body tumors are also at the
carotid bifurcation. Both carotid body tumors and aneurysms are not visible until they
are large.
 If the patient complains of amaurosis fugax (i.e., transient vision loss), fundoscopy may
reveal cholesterol plaques called Hollenhorst plaques. These are thought to originate
from the carotid plaque.
Palpation:
 The carotid pulse is palpated on the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
Carotid palpation is generally not performed routinely as it may cause a syncopal episode
in elderly patients with sensitive carotid bulbs.
 A robust temporal pulse anterior to the ear is a sign of a patent common and external
carotid artery sign.
 A large supraclavicular pulse may indicate an enlarged subclavian artery. Otherwise, the
subclavian artery is usually not palpable.
Auscultation:
 Auscultate the carotid arteries for bruits.

 Using the stethoscope bell, you can hear the S1, and S2 heart sounds in the carotid artery
in the mid-neck. A bruit heard in the neck is not normal. This could be transmitted
from the heart or could be from a kink or narrowing in the carotid artery. The carotid
bruit is lou
