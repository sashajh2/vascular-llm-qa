 underwent CEA
and postoperative laryngoscopy evaluations, cranial
nerve injuries were found in 11.4% of 656 carotid operations.436 However, approximately one-third of the patients with documented cranial nerve injuries
diagnosed by otolaryngology examination were clinically
asymptomatic. In the CREST trial, the incidence of CNI
was 4.7%. However, there was no signiﬁcant adverse
impact of CNI on patient quality of life at 1 year after surgery.5,439 The most commonly injured nerves include, in
decreasing order of incidence, the hypoglossal, recurrent
laryngeal, superior laryngeal, marginal mandibular, glossopharyngeal, and spinal accessory nerves.417,435
In another study, a vast majority of CNIs were transient.
Only 47 patients (0.7%) had a persistent CNI at their
follow-up visit (median, 10.0 months; range, 0.3-

15.6 months). Predictors for CNI included urgent procedures (OR, 1.6), immediate reexploration after closure under the same anesthetic (OR, 2.0), and return to the
operating room for a neurologic event or bleeding (OR,
2.3).435
The most appropriate way to avoid CNI is with appropriate knowledge of the relevant anatomy and meticulous identiﬁcation and protection of the nervous
structures during the conduct of the operation. Sharp
dissection close to the arterial wall, and strict adherence
to some general surgical rules, including careful use of forceps, retractors, cautery, and arterial clamps is mandatory.
Perioperative dexamethasone administration has been
shown to reduce risk of temporary CNIs during CEA
without reducing the prevalence of permanent CNIs.440
However, there is a remarkable paucity of data concerning
treatment of CNIs once they have happened.250
Nerve injury is most often caused by blunt stretch injury
to the nerves, which can occur with excessive traction;
frank nerve transection is extremely
