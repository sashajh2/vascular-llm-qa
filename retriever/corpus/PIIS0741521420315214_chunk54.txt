 reduction in SCI and stroke,150
these complications certainly compromise the effectiveness of TEVAR. Off-label and emerging technologies offer
the potential to reduce the complications of LSA surgical
revascularization. For well over a decade, various techniques have been described for retrograde in situ graft
fenestration and stenting, in which the TEVAR graft is
punctured with a needle or laser and dilated and a
covered stent is inserted to bridge from the fenestration
to the LSA,151-153 although the impact of these techniques
on the durability of the graft is unknown. Chimney or
double-barrel stents have also been described, which
involve deployment of a covered stent in the LSA concomitantly with a thoracic stent graft, preserving ﬂow into the
LSA.154,155 More recently, TEVAR grafts with a branch for
the LSA have been developed and are actively being evaluated in clinical trials.156,157 Industry-sponsored trials of
fenestrated and branched distal aortic arch endografts
as well as multiple case reports of homemade or
physician-modiﬁed endografts will likely change the
approach to revascularization of the LSA in the future.
Recommendation 19: For elective TEVAR of a TAA
where coverage of the LSA is necessary for adequate
stent graft seal, we suggest preoperative or concomitant
LSA revascularization. Level of recommendation: Grade
1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 20: For patients in whom the anatomy to be treated compromises perfusion to vital structures, we recommend LSA revascularization. Level of
recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Examples of these circumstances include the following:
Presence of a patent LIMA to coronary artery bypass graft
Termination of the left vertebral artery into the posterior
inferior cerebellar artery
Absent, atretic, or occluded right vertebral artery
Patent left arm arteriovenous shunt for dialysis
Prior infrarenal aortic operation or EVAR with previously
ligated or covered lumbar and middle sacral arteries
Planned extensive coverage ($15 cm) of
