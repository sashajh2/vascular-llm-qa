 patients with associated, more advanced
CVDs, such as venous edema, skin changes, or ulcerations.
To accomplish this task, a joint Venous Guideline Committee of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the
American Venous Forum (AVF) was established.
Under no circumstance should these Guidelines be
construed in practice or legal terms as defining the “standard of care,” which is solely determined by the condition
of the individual patient, treatment setting, and other factors. Individual factors in a given patient, such as symptom
variance or combinations, comorbidities, work, and socioeconomic factors may dictate a different approach than that
described in the Guidelines. Because technology and disease knowledge is rapidly expanding, new approaches may
supersede these recommendations. As important new information on management of varicose veins and related
CVD becomes available, these recommendations will be
revised without delay.
METHODOLOGY OF GUIDELINES
Evidence-based medicine is the conscientious, explicit,
and judicious use of the current best evidence in making
decisions about the care of individual patients.14 Guidelines
for the care of patients with varicose veins, as recommended
in this report, are based on scientific evidence. The need for
adopting evidence-based guidelines and reporting stan-

dards for venous diseases has long been recognized by
international experts15 and by leaders of the SVS16 and
AVF.17-20 To define current guidelines, members of the
Venous Guideline Committee reviewed the relevant literature, including previously published consensus documents
and guidelines,21-31 meta-analyses,6-12,32-42 the AVF reports on the Venous Summit at the 2006 and 2009 Pacific
Vascular Symposiums13,43-46 and considered the recommendations published in the third edition of the Handbook
of Venous Disorders, Guidelines of the American Venous
Forum.47
The guidelines in this publication are based on the
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development,
and Evaluation (GRADE) system, as it was described by
Guyatt et al (Table I).48 For each guideline, the letter A, B,
or C marks the level of current evidence. The grade of
recommendation of a guideline can be strong (1) or
