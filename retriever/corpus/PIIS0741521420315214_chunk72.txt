2 patients treated for TAA,
only 11% required reintervention at 60 months of
follow-up.206 Indications for reintervention were type I
endoleaks in about 7% and infection and type III endoleaks in 1% each. No secondary intervention was performed for aneurysm expansion or endograft collapse.206
In contrast, 63 consecutive patients treated in Essen,
Germany, with TEVAR for PAU were followed up for a
mean of 46 months. In this experience, 19% required
reintervention for late endoleaks (6.3%), with the
remainder requiring reintervention secondary to disease
progression.210 A review of the outcomes captured in the
Hospital Episode Statistics database in England revealed
that 6% of patients treated for intact aortic aneurysms
required reintervention within 30 days after TEVAR.211
The average time to any reintervention was 28 months.
In contrast to those treated for intact TAA, 33% of patients treated with TEVAR for ruptured aneurysms will
require additional intervention at 3 years.211
Concern for long-term, cumulative radiation exposure
has been growing, especially when TEVAR is performed
in younger patients. Patients treated with TEVAR for
intact aneurysms with favorable imaging ﬁndings by
CTA at 1 month and 6 months are unlikely to have any
complication in their lifetime that will need reintervention.212 Given the good outcomes exempliﬁed in the
two scenarios described before, it is not surprising that
delayed follow-up imaging (>1.5 years) has been shown
to be relatively safe in midterm studies.213 However, there
is an absence of long-term data supporting this
approach. In addition, late stent graft collapse, infection,
and endograft disruption can occur,214 and late conversion to open repair occurs at an average of 5 years and
up to 98 months after initial implantation, suggesting
that patients undergoing TEVAR should be observed
for life.101,215

Recommendation 36: We recommend contrastenhanced CT scanning at 1 month and 12 months after
TEVAR and then yearly for life
