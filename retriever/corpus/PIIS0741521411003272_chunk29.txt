 flow of ⱖ500 ms, with a diameter of
ⱖ3.5 mm, located beneath a healed or open venous ulcer
(CEAP class C5-C6).5,81,88,89
Duplex findings in CVD. A duplex evaluation of
patients with CVD demonstrated that superficial vein reflux
was present in 90% and that 70% to 80% have reflux in the
GSV.90 Patients with venous ulcers usually have multilevel
disease affecting the superficial, deep, and perforating veins.
Duplex evaluations have also revealed that 74% to 93% of all
patients with venous ulcers have superficial vein incompetence, with superficial venous reflux being the only abnormality in 17% to 54% of the limbs. Of 239 patients with
venous ulcers evaluated with duplex scanning in three
different studies, 144 (60.3%) had incompetent perforating
veins, and 141 (59%) had deep vein incompetence or
obstruction.91-93
Plethysmography
Plethysmography (air or strain-gauge) is used for the
noninvasive evaluation of calf muscle pump function, global
venous reflux, and venous outflow obstruction.86,94-96 Straingauge plethysmography is usually performed with a modified
protocol of Struckmann, validated previously by comparison
with simultaneously recorded ambulatory venous pressure
measurements.97-100 Strain-gauge or air plethysmography
consists of exercise venous plethysmography, measurement of
passive refill and drainage, and outflow plethysmography.
Plethysmography quantifies venous reflux and obstruction
and has been used to monitor venous functional changes and
assess physiologic outcome of surgical treatments.95 For more
details of these examinations, the reader is referred to original
articles94,96,97 and a recent relevant book chapter.100
The use of plethysmography is less frequently indicated
in patients with CEAP C2 disease (simple varicose veins),
but these studies provide information on venous function
in patients
