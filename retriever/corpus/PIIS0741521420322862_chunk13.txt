 inferior mesenteric vein)
connect the inferior mesenteric (via the left colic artery)
to the superior mesenteric (via the middle colic artery).16
The disruption of these collateral networks, for whatever
reason (eg, IMA ligation during exposure of the infrarenal
aorta), can lead to AMI and CMI in patients with MAOD.
Because of this well-developed network of collaterals,
most patients usually do not develop symptoms of CMI
or AMI unless there is a signiﬁcant stenosis or occlusion
in at least two of the mesenteric vessels (ie, CA, SMA,
and/or IMA). Notably, Oderich et al6 described the arteriographic ﬁndings of more than 200 patients with CMI
and reported that 98% had signiﬁcant occlusive disease
in two of the three mesenteric vessels and 92% had an
occlusion or critical stenosis in the SMA. In a longitudinal
study of asymptomatic patients with mesenteric
ischemia, only patients with signiﬁcant occlusive disease
in all three mesenteric vessels eventually developed
symptoms.17 However, signiﬁcant occlusive disease in a
single mesenteric vessel, usually the SMA, can lead to
CMI if the collateral network is inadequate.4-6 Unfortunately, there is not a direct association between the
number of mesenteric vessels involved and the presence
of symptoms, thereby confounding the diagnosis and
underscoring the difference between MAOD and CMI.
During the fasting state, 20% of the cardiac output
courses through the mesenteric arteries.18 The gastrointestinal blood ﬂow increases after a meal, achieving
levels that exceed the fasting values by 100% to 150%
over the ensuing 3 to 6 hours.19 This hyperemic response
starts with the anticipation of the meal, but the major
hemodynamic effects become most evident after ingestion and movement of the food bolus into the small
bowel. The vasodilation of the mesenteric vessels begins
3 to 5 minutes after ingestion and persists for 4 to 6 hours
depending on the meal composition with the maximal
