antation. Surgery should be delayed for 14 days after
coronary angioplasty and 30 days after a bare-metal
stent if dual antiplatelet therapy cannot be continued
through the perioperative period. Likewise, OSR should
not be performed within 6 months after implantation
of a drug-eluting stent if cessation of dual antiplatelet
therapy is required.98 This recommendation assumes
the use of newer generation drug-eluting stents in
patients with stable ischemic heart disease. Thus, percutaneous EVAR should be considered the operative
method of choice if aneurysm treatment becomes
necessary within 6 months after placement of a drugeluting stent as dual antiplatelet therapy can typically
be continued with use of this approach.
In summary, a recommendation for percutaneous or
surgical intervention for coronary artery disease should
follow established clinical practice guidelines, regardless
of the need for aneurysm repair.91 Whereas simultaneous
open aneurysm repair and coronary artery bypass grafting has been reported for select symptomatic patients
with critical coronary artery disease,99-102 if it is anatomically feasible, EVAR under local anesthesia would be a
preferred option.
We suggest coronary revascularization before aneurysm repair in
patients with acute ST-segment or non-ST-segment elevation
MI, unstable angina, or stable angina with left main coronary
artery or three-vessel disease.

B (Moderate)

We suggest coronary revascularization before aneurysm repair
in patients with stable angina and two-vessel disease that
includes the proximal left descending artery and either
ischemia on noninvasive stress testing or reduced left
ventricular function (ejection fraction < 50%).

We suggest deferring open aneurysm repair for at least 6
months after drug-eluting coronary stent placement or,
alternatively, performing EVAR with continuation of dual
antiplatelet therapy.
