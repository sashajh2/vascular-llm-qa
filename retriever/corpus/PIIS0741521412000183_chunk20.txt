 obstruction and those related
to an underlying procoagulant–anticoagulant imbalance. The
development of limb-threatening venous ischemia may thus
be multifactorial, related to elevated venous pressures as well
as profound procoagulant–anticoagulant imbalances. Regardless of the mechanism, venous gangrene is associated with
death in one-third or more of patients and high rates of
amputation.52,54,57,59
The primary goals in the treatment of PCD with impending tissue loss are arresting thrombus progression,
thereby preserving patency of the collateral circulation, and
restoring venous outflow. Appropriate anticoagulation,
fluid resuscitation, and leg elevation are important early in
the management of PCD.53,57 The ACCP has developed
guidelines for the management of venous gangrene in the
setting of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.61 These
guidelines strongly recommend anticoagulation with a
nonheparin anticoagulant (Grade 1B) until the platelet
count has stabilized at a normal level. Warfarin should not
be instituted until the platelet count has recovered (Grade
1B). The clinician should consult the ACCP guidelines for
full details of the anticoagulant management of venous
gangrene associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.61 Although heparin is effective in cancer-associated
thrombosis, institution of warfarin may also lead to venous
gangrene and should be approached with caution.58
Despite the critical importance of appropriate anticoagulation in arresting thrombus progression, such treatment does
little to address underlying mechanical issues related to profound venous outflow obstruction. Older reviews of the literature suggested that heparin alone was ineffective in the treatment of venous gangrene.52 We recommend that all patients
with impending tissue loss related to venous thrombosis be
evaluated for iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction as
well as potential causes of profound hypercoagulability
such as malignancy and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Anticoagulation should be initiated according to the
