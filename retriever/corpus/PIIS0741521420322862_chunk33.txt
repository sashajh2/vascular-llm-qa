uate ligament with either a laparoscopic or open surgical approach. The reported experience with isolated IMA revascularization for the
treatment for CMI is limited to relatively small case series
and the outcomes have been somewhat equivocal.95,96
The isolated endovascular revascularization of the CA or
IMA in the setting of a severely disease SMA may be
considered as a bridge to open bypass or retrograde
SMA stenting.97
There has been a long-standing debate about the number of mesenteric vessels that should be revascularized
in patients with CMI that has persisted since the era
when only open surgical revascularization was an option.
There are some theoretical advantages to revascularizing
both the SMA and CA, but most reports indicate that
treatment of the SMA alone is sufﬁcient.33,94,98 Two
recent retrospective studies from the Massachusetts
General Hospital group and by Silva et al31 have shown
a nonsigniﬁcant trend towards a lower recurrence rate
with
treatment
of
both
vessels.98
However,
94
Malgor et al from the Mayo Clinic reported similar
recurrence rates at 2 years in patients treated with intraluminal stents in the SMA compared with those treated
with stents in both the SMA and CA. It is conceivable
that the lack of signiﬁcant difference in these studies
was due to the small sample size and a type 2 error.
Furthermore, there may have been a selection bias
with stent placement in both the SMA and CA reserved
for patients with a suboptimal results of SMA treatment
alone. Revascularization of both the CA and SMA may
have a role in select patients with severe gastric ischemia
and those without adequate collaterals. However, there
is no proven beneﬁt that revascularizing both vessels provides more durable relief, and the second (or additional)
intervention adds cost and potential risk.
There is likely a role for revascularization in patients
with symptoms consistent with CMI and occlusive disease isolated to single mesenteric vessel, particularly
the SMA. Patients with CMI typically have MAOD
affecting both the CA and the SMA or all three of the
mesenteric vessels as noted, and there has been a classic
teaching that stressed the
