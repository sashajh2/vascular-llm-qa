ow artery distal to the distal anastomosis. Most of these lesions occur within the ﬁrst 12 to
18 months after surgery but can continue to develop or progress years later. Relying on clinical assessment alone may miss
critical vein graft stenoses that threaten graft thrombosis, especially in patients treated for CLI (see below). Vascular
laboratory-based surveillance programs of lower extremity
vein grafts focus on detection using duplex ultrasound surveillance (DUS), grading, and monitoring of stenotic lesions
