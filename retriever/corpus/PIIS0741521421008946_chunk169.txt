 undergoing general surgery, 0.2% to 0.9%
with orthopaedic surgery, 0.6% to 0.9% lung operations,
and 0.8% to 3.0% of patients undergoing peripheral
vascular procedures.551,552 However, perioperative stroke
in these circumstances have devastating effects with as
high as 32% 30-day mortality and 58% major disability
in the POISE trial.550 Multivariate analysis of 523,059 patients identiﬁed age, history of MI within 6 months, acute
renal failure, a history of stroke or TIA, dialysis, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and current
tobacco use to be independent predictors of stroke.549 A
high body mass index corresponded with a lower stroke
risk.549
Patients scheduled for noncardiac surgery should be
queried about stoke or TIA symptoms. If there is clinical
evidence of a symptomatic cerebrovascular event
within the last 6 months, the patient should have imaging of the carotid and brain and undergo carotid revascularization, thereby postponing the noncardiac
surgery.549,553 In patients with peripheral arterial disease, the rate of asymptomatic carotid stenosis of
greater than 70% is 14%.554,555 Therefore, clinical judgement may dictate the need for preoperative imaging in
patients with peripheral arterial disease underdoing
noncardiac surgery. Most important, carotid stenosis

may be just one sign that the patient has diffuse atherosclerosis, in particular, coronary disease. In a prospective
series of 390 patients undergoing elective carotid stenting, 22% had three-vessel disease, and 7% had left main
disease, emphasizing the importance of risk factor
reduction and optimal medical management with antiplatelet agents, statins, and blood pressure control.151,556
However, there are other predictors of postoperative
stroke, such as female gender or renal failure that are
nonmodiﬁable.557 If not absolutely contraindicated,
statin and antiplatelet therapy should continue in the
perioperative period of non
