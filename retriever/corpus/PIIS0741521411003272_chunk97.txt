Endovenous thermal ablations (laser and radiofrequency ablations) are safe and
effective, and we recommend them for treatment of saphenous
incompetence.
Because of reduced convalescence and less pain and morbidity, we recommend
endovenous thermal ablation of the incompetent saphenous vein over open
surgery.

The Committee noted that these studies had shortterm to medium-term follow-up, 1 year in two studies, 2
years in one study, and 3 years in the fourth study. RFA
treatment resulted in faster return to work and normal
activities, higher patient satisfaction, less pain, and better
short-term QOL scores, with high-quality evidence confirming early efficacy and safety. The studies, however, did
not report bias protection measures; therefore, the evidence of midterm efficacy is of low quality and no evidence
is available on long-term efficacy.
Radiofrequency ablation vs endovenous laser ablation. Four RCTs compared RFA with EVLA.255,280,284-286
Morrison255 reported a single-center randomized trial performed in 50 patients with bilateral GSV reflux. One limb
was treated with RFA and the other with EVLA. The
saphenous occlusion rate was 80% with RFA and 66% with
EVLA (P ⫽ NS), and there was no difference in early
complication rates.
In the prospective, industry-sponsored, multicenter
Radiofrequency Endovenous ClosureFAST versus Laser
Ablation for the Treatment of Great Saphenous Reflux:
A Multicenter, Single-blinded, Randomized Study
(RECOVERY) trial, Almeida et al286 randomized 87
limbs to treatment with RF catheter or 980-nm EVLA.
There were no major complications. All scores referable
to pain, ecchymosis, and tenderness were statistically
lower in the catheter group at 48 hours, 1 week, and 2
weeks. Minor complications were more prevalent in the
EVLA group (P ⫽ .02). VCSS
