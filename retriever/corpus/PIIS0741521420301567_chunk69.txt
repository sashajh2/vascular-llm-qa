In patients with SMAA, we recommend CTA as the diagnostic tool of choice.

Symptomatic SMAA presents with similar symptoms as
other acute abdominal emergencies, such as perforated
viscus, making the diagnosis difﬁcult without an appropriate level of suspicion.163 Although many SMAAs show
a rim of calciﬁcation on plain kidney, ureter, and bladder
radiography164 and duplex ultrasound can be helpful in
diagnosis,165 CTA is the most expeditious and reliable
diagnostic tool.166 Isolated superior mesenteric artery
dissection has been diagnosed more routinely because
of an increase in use of CTA for patients who present
with abdominal pain.167,168

and trauma are the other causes of SMAA.169 Mycotic
SMAAs usually present in younger patients (<50 years
of age), whereas nonmycotic SMAAs are seen in older patients.169 Unlike other visceral aneurysms, 70% to 90% of
SMAAs are symptomatic at the time of presentation,
with abdominal pain the most common symptom, followed by abdominal mass, fever, nausea, and gastrointestinal bleeding.166,170 The natural history of SMAA
appears to be one of expansion and rupture,92,166 with
38% to 50% of patients presenting with ruptured aneurysm92,170; the mortality rate is 30% to 90%.92 At the

We recommend repair of all SMAAs and pseudoaneurysms as soon as the
diagnosis is made regardless of size.
