RAAs are associated with ﬁbromuscular dysplasia in up
to 68% of cases and concomitant arterial aneurysms
affecting the aorta and visceral and iliac vessels in 7%
to 30% of cases.14,31,34,36,37,39,40,50,51,58 The most recent scientiﬁc statement from the American Heart Association

addition, one-time screening for occult aortic or arterial
aneurysm in these patients is recommended.

diagnosis of incidental SAAs in the United States is primarily related to the liberal use of cross-sectional imaging studies.84 Most SAAs currently are detected

We suggest completion imaging after open surgical reconstruction for RAA, before
hospital discharge, by way of axial imaging with CTA or MRA or arteriography in select
cases, and long-term follow-up with surveillance imaging.

5.2

For patients managed nonoperatively, we suggest annual surveillance imaging until
two consecutive studies are stable; thereafter, surveillance imaging may be extended
to every 2 to 3 years

B (Moderate)

Most earlier series advocate completion imaging before
hospital discharge by way of arteriography or ultrasound.
In the more modern era, this can probably be replaced
with axial imaging with CTA or M
