in patients with symptoms of ⬍14 days of duration would
seem fairly secure. Although a benefit in patients with a
duration of symptoms of ⬎14 days cannot be excluded,
chronic thrombosis does appear to be associated with inferior results,16 and the relative benefits vs risks in such
patients should be considered on an individualized basis.
Given the options available for the treatment of acute
iliofemoral DVT, it is unlikely that all patients would
choose a strategy of surgical thrombectomy, catheterdirected pharmacologic thrombolysis, or pharmacomechanical thrombolysis. Individual patients undoubtedly place
different values on the benefits of avoiding the postthrombotic syndrome vs the risks and burdens of a surgical
procedure or bleeding. Most patients place a higher value
on avoiding early death than on avoiding late outcomes
that affect quality of life.51
A decision analysis evaluating systemic streptokinase in
the treatment of DVT suggests that patients would be
unlikely to accept more than a 1.7-fold increase in major
bleeding compared with heparin therapy.51 On the basis of
individual variation in values and preferences, strategies of
early thrombus removal should be considered a Grade 2
recommendation. Recommendation of a strategy of early
thrombus removal requires a careful assessment of the
potential risks and benefits for the individual patient, and
for those patients in whom early thrombus removal is
deemed a reasonable therapeutic option, a careful discussion with the patient to ensure that the physician’s recommendation is concordant with the patient’s values and
preferences.
2.2. We recommend early thrombus removal strategies as the treatment of choice in patients with limbthreatening venous ischemia due to iliofemoral deep
venous thrombosis with or without associated femoropopliteal venous thrombosis (phlegmasia cerulea dolens) (Grade 1A). Phlegmasia cerulea dolens (PCD) is
characterized by massive swelling, cyanosis, and pain resulting from extensive thrombosis of the iliofemoral venous
outflow.52,53 Pedal pulses remain palpable in ⬃50% of
patients.54,55 Massive fluid sequestration may lead to hypovolemia and hypotension
