We recommend a prompt evaluation for possible graft
limb occlusion if patients develop new-onset lower extremity claudication, ischemia, or reduction in ABI after
aneurysm repair.

We recommend antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent
graft infection before any dental procedure involving
the manipulation of the gingival or periapical region
of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa, including
scaling and root canal procedures, for any patient
with an aortic prosthesis, whether placed by OSR or
EVAR.

We recommend surveillance of type II endoleaks not
associated with aneurysm expansion.

After aneurysm repair, we recommend prompt evaluation for possible graft infection if a patient presents with
generalized sepsis, groin drainage, pseudoaneurysm formation, or ill-deﬁned pain.
