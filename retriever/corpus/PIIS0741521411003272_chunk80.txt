 A
third technique that recently emerged includes the use of
superheated steam, which destroys the endothelial layer
and causes shrinkage of the collagen.233 Early clinical application, as reported by Milleret et al,233 is promising, but
available data are not sufficient to include this technique in
our report in more detail. EVLA and RFA are similar
techniques in many ways, so a discussion of concepts and
data applying to both of these procedures is appropriate.
Occlusion (ablation) of the treated vein is achieved by
heat delivered into the vein through the percutaneously
placed laser fiber or an RF catheter. Endovenous thermal
ablation causes a direct thermal injury to the vein wall,
resulting in destruction of the endothelium, collagen denaturation of the media, and fibrotic and thrombotic occlusions of the vein. The endothermal ablations by laser also
provide direct heat injury to the blood.234 Blood coagulates at 70°C to 80°C, steam bubbles form at 100°C, and
carbonization of coagulum is observed at 200°C to 300°C.
Currently available laser fibers include hemoglobin-specific
laser wavelengths (810, 940, and 980 nm) and waterspecific laser wavelengths (1319, 1320, and 1470 nm).
Laser treatment was first recommended by Puglisi235 in
1989, but it was 10 years later that Boné236 reported the
first successful clinical application of a diode laser for the
treatment of varicose veins. Boné et al237reported EVLA
first in the English literature in 2001, and the technique was
soon adopted and perfected in the United States and
worldwide.7,238-250
