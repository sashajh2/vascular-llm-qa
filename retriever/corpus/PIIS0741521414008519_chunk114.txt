 functioning venous valve with pieces of vein tissue or
endoluminal scar to fashion competent valves by various techniques. These include suturing of tissue in place within the
opened vein; invagination of the stump of the great saphenous
vein into the femoral vein with appropriate sutures placed to
act as a valve; use of tacking sutures to secure the anterior

vein wall inside the vein lumen to act as valve, with a synthetic
patch used to replace the anterior wall; and dissection of the
intimal-medial wall of the often postphlebitic vein to form a
monocuspid or bicuspid valve, with proper sutures placed to
form a functioning valve. Regarding the ﬁrst three techniques,
small case series have been reported, but they lack corroborative series from other surgeons. Raju and Hardy reported ﬁve
of seven patients to have healed recalcitrant VLUs within 4
months without recurrence during a
