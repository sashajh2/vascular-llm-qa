4.2.3. For patients with symptomatic axial reﬂux of
the AAGSV or PAGSV, we suggest either thermal or
nonthermal ablation, with additional phlebectomy, if
needed, depending on the available expertise of the
treating physician and the preference of the patient.

5. Factors affecting choice of superﬁcial truncal ablation
and outcomes
5.1.1. In symptomatic patients with C2 disease, we
suggest against using truncal vein diameter to determine which patients need venous ablation.

Rationale. A commonly accepted diameter threshold
for ablation of the GSV or the SSV has been 5 mm. However, data show that ablation of veins <5 mm in diameter
also improves symptoms.122,123
Evidence. Several studies demonstrated a weak correlation between saphenous vein diameter and
increased CEAP clinical class or VCSS; a correlation between QOL and saphenous vein diameter has not been
found.122,124 Most studies segregated veins diameters
into >5 mm or <5 mm. Tan et al124 performed a systematic review of 11 studies and 2732 limbs. Four
studies correlated truncal vein diameter with QOL,
while seven reported only on clinical severity measures.
Four studies found a weak correlation between vein
diameter and VCSS, while one demonstrated correlation with VCSS components.124 The diameters were a
poor predictor of HRQOL, with no relationship to patients’ perceived impact on CVD. The review concluded
that vein diameters should not be used as a single
determinant of who needs venous intervention.124
Perrins et al examined the clinical and anatomical
outcomes of RFA of symptomatic small-diameter
GSVs.
