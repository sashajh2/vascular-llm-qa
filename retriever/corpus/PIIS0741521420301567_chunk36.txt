For patients managed nonoperatively, we suggest annual surveillance imaging until
two consecutive studies are stable; thereafter, surveillance imaging may be extended
to every 2 to 3 years

Most earlier series advocate completion imaging before
hospital discharge by way of arteriography or ultrasound.
In the more modern era, this can probably be replaced
with axial imaging with CTA or MRA, obviating the limitations of ultrasound in the postoperative period and the
invasiveness of angiography and long-term follow-up
with surveillance imaging.9,31,37,49,50,61
The natural history of RAAs appears to be that of slow to
null growth. Most recent estimates suggest a median
annualized growth rate of 0.06 to 0.6 mm.14,39,40 The
most recent and largest multi-institutional retrospective
series of nonoperative RAA surveillance found no difference in growth rate based on aneurysm morphology or
calciﬁcation.14 Whereas short-term follow-up at 1 year remains prudent for a newly diagnosed RAA, longer intervals between surveillance imaging may be appropriate,
provided the patient’s compliance with follow-up can
be ensured.

SPLENIC ARTERY ANEURYSM (SAA)

incidentally during diagnostic imaging performed for
other indications.83 Whereas plain radiography, ultrasound, CT, MRA, and arteriography have identiﬁed
SAAs, CTA remains the initial diagnostic and evaluative
tool of choice.83
CTA is an important imaging modality for the vascular
system and has been established as the method of
choice for the diagnosis, treatment planning, and
follow-up of most diseases of the abdominal arteries
including the aorta and visceral vessels. Besides being
able to assess the location and size of the SAA, CTA
may also reveal rupture, intra-abdominal hemorrhage,
and associated underlying diseases. In addition, nearly
all necessary data for planning endovascular treatment
can be obtained by multidimensional CTA.83 Ultrasound
examination of visceral vessels is inhibited by shadowing
from bowel gas as well as by obesity; however, its sensitivity to detect SAA <3 cm is poor.83,
