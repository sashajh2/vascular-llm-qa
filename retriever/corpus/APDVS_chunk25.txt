 and routine surveillance carotid duplexes.
Discussion: This patient has asymptomatic 50-69% left carotid stenosis with the associated risk factors of vascular disease which include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and
smoking history. Medical therapy needs to be employed to reduce these factors, thus a
single antiplatelet, statin, and blood pressure medication are indicated. Fortunately, the
patient is not a current smoker, however if she was, then smoking cessation counseling
would be added to her treatment plan. Carotid revascularization is indicated only for
asymptomatic carotid stenosis that is >70% based on current guidelines.

Operative Footage Questions
These questions are associated with the carotid endarterectomy (CEA) footage (short version) found at the bottom of the chapter.
1. What is the first muscle layer encountered in a CEA (i.e. the first muscle deep to skin)?
A. Sternocleidomastoid
B. Digastric
C. Platysma
D. Scalene
Answer
C. Platysma
Discussion: The platysma is the most superficial muscle in the neck. It covers most of
the anterior and lateral aspect of the neck. It is the first muscle layer encountered in
the neck during a CEA. It will be bisected and repaired upon neck closure. While the
sternocleidomastoid is superficial, it is deep to the platysma. The sternocleidomastoid
is an important landmark as it forms the anterolateral boundary of the carotid triangle.

You will dissect along its medial border and retract it laterally in order to access the
carotid sheath.The digastric muscle is a small, “two-bellied” muscle located under the
mandible. The posterior belly forms the superior border of the carotid triangle. It is often
visualized in patients with high carotid bifurcations.The scalene muscles are deep to the
sternocleidomastoid muscles and lateral to the cervical spine. They are not manipulated
in a CEA.
2. What structure is not found in the carotid sheath?
A. Internal jugular vein
B. External jugular vein
C. Common carotid artery
D
