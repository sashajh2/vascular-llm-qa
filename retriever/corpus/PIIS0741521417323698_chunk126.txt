Maintenance of body temperature. Maintenance of
body temperature above 36 C during aneurysm repair
appears to be beneﬁcial with respect to hemodynamics,
laboratory measures of clotting function, and metabolic
acidosis.586,595 Prospective randomized data support
the use of forced air warming blankets rather than
circulating water mattresses.595 In addition, prospective
studies support the use of low fresh ﬂow rate anesthetic

We recommend maintaining core body temperature at or

Role of the ICU. Increasingly, the care of the postoperative patient is occurring in a step-down unit or other
monitored settings to best focus use of the ICU on those
patients in greatest need.598 Selective use of the ICU after
aneurysm surgery is most effective if preoperative
criteria, such as pre-existing signiﬁcant coronary artery,
pulmonary, or renal disease, or intraoperative criteria,
such as a signiﬁcant arrhythmia, hemodynamic instability, or requirement for postoperative mechanical
ventilation, are established.599 In a study of 230 patients
undergoing aneurysm repair, 89% avoided admission to
ICU by use of systematic preoperative evaluation to
identify predictors of poor outcome.600
Goal-directed therapy using noninvasive monitoring of
cardiac output by esophageal Doppler or lithium indicator dilution and pulse power analysis has been shown to
improve short-term outcomes.601,602 Monitoring cardiac
output with a deﬁned treatment protocol has also
been shown to be cost-effective in the setting of major
