 recurrence vs ultrasound recurrence.37 Because the clinical relevance of ultrasound imaged recurrence is unclear, such data
should be interpreted with caution. Second, although
short-term outcomes such as postoperative pain, perioperative complications, and return to work and usual activities are important for many patients, superﬁcial venous
disease is a chronic disease, and long-term patient outcomes should be prioritized over the short-term clinical
outcomes. The committee elected to prioritize the outcomes in the following order: (1) QoL at 5 years; (2) recurrence and need for reintervention at 5 years; (3) major
and minor perioperative adverse events; (4) postoperative
pain and return to work and usual activities; (5) anatomic
closure at 5 years; and (6) cost of the procedure. The
guideline committee and the systematic review did not
include a formal cost-effectiveness analysis because
almost all reported and reviewed studies had been performed in the United Kingdom and other European countries, where the cost and reimbursement system differs
from that in the United States.19 Therefore, the costeffectiveness judgments in the evidence to decision tables were usually labeled as unknown.
Evidence synthesis. The guideline panel for the present
document (part I) prioritized ﬁve critical questions that are
most relevant to the current management of patients with
varicose veins. The questions were as follows: (1) the diagnostic utility of duplex ultrasound (DU) in adults with varicose veins (class C2-C6); (2) high ligation and surgical
stripping vs any endovenous ablation technique for

patients with varicose veins and axial incompetence of the
great saphenous vein (GSV) or small saphenous vein (SSV);
(3) thermal vs nonthermal endovenous ablation technique
outcomes for patients with varicose veins and axial
incompetence of the GSV or SSV; (4) incompetent perforating vein ablation vs no perforator ablation for patients
with simple varicose veins (CEAP class C2) with or without
axial incompetence of the GSV or SSV; and (5) treatment of
varicose tributaries with phlebectomy or sclerotherapy,
concomitant with, or staged after, endovenous ablation of
the incompetent G
