 on duplex scanning. Air plethysmography remains one of the few noninvasive techniques
that can quantify reflux reliably98,99 although other parameters have been reported to be variably useful. The Guideline Committee encourages using air plethysmography as
“best practice” in the evaluation of patients with advance
CVD if duplex scanning does not provide definitive diagnosis on pathophysiology (CEAP C3-C6).
Imaging studies
Contrast venography. Ascending or descending contrast venography for varicosities or other forms of CVD is
performed selectively in patients with deep venous obstruc-

tion, in patients with post-thrombotic syndrome, and if
endovenous or open surgical treatment is planned. It can be
used with direct venous pressure measurements to evaluate
patients with varicose veins and associated iliac vein obstruction (May-Thurner syndrome). Contrast venography
is routinely used in CVD to perform endovenous procedures, such as angioplasty or venous stenting or open
venous reconstructions.
CT and MR venography. Patients with simple varicose veins rarely require imaging studies more sophisticated
than duplex ultrasonography. The techniques of CT and
MR imaging have progressed tremendously in the past
decade, and they provide excellent three-dimensional imaging of the venous system. MR and CT are both suitable

For clinical examination of the lower limbs for chronic venous disease, we recommend
inspection (telangiectasia, varicosity, edema, skin discoloration, corona
phlebectatica, lipodermatosclerosis, ulcer), palpation (
