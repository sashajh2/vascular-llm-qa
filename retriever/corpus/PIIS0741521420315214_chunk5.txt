SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
Practice recommendations were made using the
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system.1
Recommendation 1: In patients considered at low or intermediate risk for a thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) based
on their history and physical examination ﬁndings, we suggest chest X-ray as the ﬁrst radiographic test as it may identify an alternative diagnosis for symptoms and may obviate
the need for additional aortic imaging. Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low)
Recommendation 2: In patients considered at high risk
for symptomatic TAA or acute aortic syndrome, we
recommend urgent imaging, usually computed tomography angiography (CTA) because of its speed and ease
of use for preoperative planning. Magnetic resonance
angiography and transesophage
