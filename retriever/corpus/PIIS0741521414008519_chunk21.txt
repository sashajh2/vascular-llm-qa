8.5: Primary PreventiondOperative Therapy
In patients with asymptomatic C1-2 disease from either primary or secondary causes, we suggest against prophylactic interventional therapies to prevent venous leg ulcer. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]

GUIDELINES
Guidelines present a synthesis of evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of a speciﬁc
medical condition.1 The value of a guideline is that it provides consistency among treatment protocols given to patients, resulting in improved efﬁcacy and the quality of

care and reduced cost. The need for cost containment of
health care has placed the development and implementation of clinical care guidelines as a high priority for health
care systems Both the prevalence of venous leg ulcers
(VLUs)d1% to 1.5% of the populationdand the economic impact of VLUs are two compelling reasons to
develop a speciﬁc guideline for this problem.2 The care

of VLUs can consume a signiﬁcant amount of resources, so
that an agreed on “best practice” algorithm can maximize
the quality and effectiveness of care while minimizing cost
and resource use.3 Moreover, VLUs are associated with
prolonged disability, important socioeconomic impact,
and signiﬁcant psychosocial morbidity. Because approximately 50% of VLUs may recur within 10 years, they are
marked by a signiﬁcant component of chronicity, which
compounds their economic impact and need for repetitive
care. VLUs also can be painful, so that a patient’s ability
to work may be compromised, and can also affect the
retired segments of the population, thereby compounding
both the indirect and direct costs of treating VLU.
Epidemiology of Venous Leg Ulcers. VLUs are the
most common ulceration on the lower extremity and account for 70% of all leg ulcers.4 Various estimates have
been made from observational studies on the prevalence of
VLU, ranging between 0.06% and 2%. The Edinburgh
study, which was a cross-sectional study of a random
sample of more than 1500 people between the ages of 18
