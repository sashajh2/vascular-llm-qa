 self-expanding stents should be viewed as complementary with the later potentially having a role in the
SMA for longer lesions (ie, beyond the oriﬁce), intraluminal dissections related to the initial endovascular technique, and for preserving any signiﬁcant collateral
vessels (eg, high take-off of a right hepatic artery).
Interestingly, there has been an evolution from angioplasty alone to balloon-expandable bare metal stents
to
balloon-expandable
covered
stents.32,128,129

Oderich et al compared the outcomes of patients
with primary or secondary endovascular interventions
for CMI between those undergoing treatment with
bare metal (n ¼ 164 patients and 197 vessels) or
balloon-expandable covered stents (n ¼ 61 patients and
67 vessels). They reported that the freedom from restenosis (92% 6 6% vs 52% 6 4%; P ¼ .003), freedom from
symptom recurrence (92 6 4% vs 50 6 4%; P ¼ .003),
freedom from reintervention (91 6 6% vs 56 6 5%; P ¼
.005), and primary patency at 3 years (92 6 6% vs 52 6
5%; P < .003) were all better for covered stents for the
treatment of the primary lesions. Similarly, they reported
that the freedom from restenosis (89 6 10% vs 49 6 14%;
P < .04), freedom from symptom recurrence (100% vs
64 6 9%; P ¼ .001), and freedom from reintervention
(100% vs 72 6 9%; P ¼ .03) were all better for the
covered stents in the reintervention group. Notably,

van Dijk et al130 have published the study protocol for a
randomized
trial
(CoBaGI)
comparing
balloonexpandable covered vs balloon-expandable bare-metal
stents for CMI.
