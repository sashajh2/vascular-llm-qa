 the long-term outcomes of treatment (QOL and recurrence), we
suggest treatment of the reﬂuxing superﬁcial trunk with endovenous laser ablation, RFA,
or HL&S, with additional phlebectomy, if needed, over physician-compounded UGFS
because of long-term improvement of QOL and reduced recurrence

4.2.1.

For patients with symptomatic axial reﬂux of the GSV, we recommend either thermal or
nonthermal ablation from the groin to below the knee, depending on the available
expertise of the treating physician and the preference of the patient.

5. Factors affecting choice of superﬁcial truncal ablation and outcome
Guidelines

In symptomatic patients with C2 disease we suggest against using truncal vein diameter 2 (weak)

Consensus statements
5.2.1.

In asymptomatic patients with C2 disease, prophylactic intervention does not prevent progression of venous disease. Weight
control, compression stockings, and avoiding prolonged standing may be beneﬁcial.

5.2.2.

Interventions to treat varicose veins can be performed in an ofﬁce-based setting, surgery center, or hospital operating room,
at the discretion of the physician, who is specialized in vein care. Better patient experience
