/AVF agreed that because of the
minimally invasive nature and similar or better early-term and
equivalent midterm results, endovenous thermal ablations
should be recommended over open surgery as the first line of
treatment of varicose veins associated with axial reflux. The
Committee also recognized that results of foam therapy have
improved but that they are not yet equivalent to those obtained after endovascular or open venous surgery. The Committee recommended that there was an urgent need for wellperformed, large RCTs comparing adverse effects and longterm saphenous occlusion rates of surgery, endovenous
thermal ablations, and foam sclerotherapy. These studies
should include detailed analyses of safety and costs and should
also evaluate the QOL of patients who undergo treatment
using any of these procedures.

SPECIAL VENOUS PROBLEMS
Perforating veins
An association between incompetent perforating veins
and venous ulcers was established more than a century ago
by Gay,338 and surgical perforator interruption was recommended to treat venous ulcers by Homans,339 Linton,340
Cockett et al,341,342 and Dodd.343 Hauer344 introduced
SEPS in 1985, Oâ€™Donnell345 was the first to use laparoscopic instrumentation, while the Mayo Clinic team346 and
Conrad347 improved the technique and added carbon dioxide insufflation to the procedure. Between 1992 and
2008, SEPS became the technique of choice for perforator
ablation, primarily because of the reduced rate of wound
complications.62,348-350
However, the emergence of ultrasonographically guided
thermal ablations and sclerotherapy in recent years has transformed the techniques of perforator ablation.351-356 Advantages of percutaneous ablation of perforators (PAPS) include the low risk of a minimally invasive procedure that is
easily repeatable and can be performed under local anesthesia in an office setting.357
Techniques of perforator ablation
Subfascial endoscopic perforator vein surgery. SEPS is
performed under general or epidural anesthesia. The
