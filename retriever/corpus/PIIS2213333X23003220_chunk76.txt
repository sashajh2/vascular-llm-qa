.2.3. In patients with symptomatic C2 disease, isolated SFJ incompetence does not justify ablation of
an otherwise competent GSV.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. The impact of junctional reﬂux on clinical
manifestations and treatment outcomes is not clear.
Reﬂux patterns and the presence or absence of SFJ
reﬂux have been evaluated in multiple studies and a signiﬁcant percentage of symptomatic patients have been
shown to have lower extremity reﬂux without SFJ insufﬁciency.141-143 Nevertheless, the presence of junctional
reﬂux often determines insurance coverage for ablation.
Assessing the role that junctional reﬂux plays in patients
with symptomatic varicose veins is important to ensure
appropriate care.
Evidence. Studies have indicated that the theory of
descending saphenous valvular incompetence starting
at the SFJ may be inaccurate and therefore there is no
rationale for treatment of SFJ incompetence in the
setting of a normal GSV.141-143 Abu-Own et al141 used
DUS to assess 190 limbs with primary varicose veins.

Sixty-three limbs (33%) had no SFJ incompetence. Labropoulos et al144 looked at 255 limbs in 217 patients with
superﬁcial venous insufﬁciency and normal deep veins
and perforator veins with DUS. Isolated below-knee
reﬂux was associated with more symptoms and signs
than isolated above-knee reﬂux.144 Another study by
Labropoulos et al142 looked at the prevalence of reﬂux in
age-matched asymptomatic young patients and found
that reﬂux can occur in any vein segment and the most
common site was the below knee GSV. Fassiadis et al
studied 611 limbs with primary varicose veins. Of 454
limbs that showed GSV reﬂux on DUS, 240 limbs
exhibited reﬂux of both the GSV and SFJ and 214 limbs
(35%) showed isolated GSV reﬂux with a competent SFJ.
The authors suggested that reﬂux starts distally and
progresses proximally.14
