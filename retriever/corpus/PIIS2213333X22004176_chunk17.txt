 relative importance of different
aspects of their care vary greatly and must be considered when evaluating treatment approaches. In a
pre-evaluation survey of 111 patients from the United
Kingdom, most of the patients (56%) were not concerned about missing work, and the importance of
postoperative discomfort and risk of recurrence varied.35 Because 80% of the patients reported that their

treatment decision would be inﬂuenced by the
opinion of their treating physician, it is important that
physician preferences be recognized and that the risks
and beneﬁts of all treatment options are discussed.
Another study, which had only considered the early
postoperative period, found that out-of-pocket expenses were the most important factor for many patients, followed in order by postoperative discomfort,
risk of adverse events, time to return to normal activity,
number of skin punctures required for tumescent
anesthesia, and number of required treatment visits.36
Most patients with CEAP class C2 symptomatic varicose
veins will recognize the need for long-term follow-up
vein care. The panel considered mortality, venous thromboembolism, anaphylactic shock, or stroke as extremely
rare but the most severe outcomes, followed by less severe outcomes such as wound complications, infection,
allergy, and varicose vein recurrence.
The recommendations in the present guidelines were
based on several assumptions. First, patient-centered outcomes such as QoL and recurrent varicose veins are more
important than surrogate outcomes such as anatomic
closure rates. Signiﬁcant heterogeneity in the reporting
of recurrence was found in previous systematic reviews,
with trials variously reporting overall limb recurrence vs
site-speciﬁc recurrence and clinical recurrence vs ultrasound recurrence.37 Because the clinical relevance of ultrasound imaged recurrence is unclear, such data
should be interpreted with caution. Second, although
short-term outcomes such as postoperative pain, perioperative complications, and return to work and usual activities are important for many patients, superﬁcial venous
disease is a chronic disease, and long-term patient outcomes should be prioritized over the short-term clinical
outcomes. The committee elected to prioritize the outcomes in the following order
