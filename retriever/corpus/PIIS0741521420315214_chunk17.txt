87 to 2002 in
patients with thoracic aortic dissections (ADs) or aneurysms in Sweden. Of 14,229 individuals with thoracic
aortic disease, the diagnosis was made in 11,039 (78%)
before death. The incidence of thoracic aortic disease
rose by 52% in men and 28% in women to reach 16.3
and 9.1 per 100,000 per year, respectively. The authors
concluded that the prevalence and incidence of thoracic
aortic disease were higher than previously reported and
have been steadily increasing. The rising prevalence of
TAA has been attributed to a number of factors,
including improved imaging techniques, an aging population, and increased patient and physician awareness.12
Population affected. TAA is primarily a disease of the
elderly. The average age of patients with TAA is 65 years
at diagnosis, with a male to female ratio of 1.7:1.10 In
contrast, in patients with AAA, the mean age is 75 years,
with a male to female ratio of 6:1.13 TAAs clearly have a
genetic component, with >20% of patients having a ﬁrstdegree relative affected by aneurysm disease.14-16
Risk factors for disease and rupture. Many risk factors
are common to both AAA and TAA patients, including
hypertension, smoking, and atherosclerosis in other arterial beds.10,17-19 Systemic hypertension, especially
elevated diastolic blood pressure >100 mm Hg, has been
associated with aortic growth and rupture.20,21 Although
most often described as degenerative in etiology, up to
20% of patients have TAAs that are the sequelae of
chronic AD. Importantly, for this document, TAA related
to chronic type B ADs and those associated with inherited connective tissue disorders are intentionally
excluded and are the subject of future SVS documents.
Natural history and rupture rate of TAA. Published
data on the natural history of isolated TAAs is not as
readily available as it is for infrarenal AAA, partially related
to their
