Judgment

How substantial are desirable effects
of the strategy?

Overall, there was a moderate Quality of Evidence for calcium
Probably yes
dobesilate and low Quality of Evidence for hydroxyethylrutosides
or horse chestnut extract or red vine leaf extract or sulodexide to
determine whether these compounds are effective in
symptomatic patients with varicose veins for treatment of vein
related pain, leg heaviness and/or sensation of swelling.

How substantial are the undesirable
anticipated effects?

Main side effects for hydroxyethylrutosides or horse chestnut
extract or red vine leaf extract or sulodexide are mild
gastrointestinal disturbances potentially alleviated by
administration with a meal. Calcium dobesilate adverse events
included fever, gastrointestinal disorders, skin reactions,
arthralgia, and agranulocytosis.

Monitor
agranulocytosis with
calcium dobesilate

Do the desirable effects outweigh the Probably yes
undesirable effects?

Monitor
agranulocytosis with
calcium dobesilate

What is the overall certainty of the
evidence of effects?

Moderate for calcium dobesilate, low for hydroxyethylrutosides
or horse chestnut extract or red vine leaf extract or sulodexide.
Most of the studies address the cohort of patients with CVD and
varicose veins patients are only part of them

Moderate to low

How large are the resource
requirements associated with the
intervention?

Only horse chestnut extract or red vine leaf extract are available Low
in the United States as inexpensive nutritional supplements

How large is the incremental cost
relative to the net beneÔ¨Åt?

No available data

Unknown

What would be the effect on health
inequalities?

None
