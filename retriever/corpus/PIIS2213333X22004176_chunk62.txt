580 Limbs of 500
patients with
varicose veins
(GSV; C2-C4)

EVLA (n ¼ 125);
RFA (n ¼ 125);
HL&S
(n ¼ 124)

UGFS with
physiciancompounded
foam (n ¼ 124)

Postintervention pain
score signiﬁcantly less
after UGFS and RFA; at
1 year, GSV closure was
signiﬁcantly lower
after UGFS; QoL
improved in all groups;
at 3 years, incidence of
recanalization and
reoperation after UGFS
was greater; QoL
improved in all groups

RCT

Gonzalez-Zeh
et al,185 2008

98 Patients with
varicose veins
(GSV; C2-C6)

EVLA (n ¼ 45)

UGFS with
physiciancompounded
foam (n ¼ 50;
n ¼ 53)

Procedure-associated
pain worse after EVLA
(P < .0001); at 1 year,
GSV closure higher
after EVLA (93% vs
77%; P < .046); VCSS
improved in both
groups (P < .0001)
