The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the American Venous Forum (AVF) have developed clinical practice
guidelines for the care of patients with varicose veins of the lower limbs and pelvis. The document also includes
recommendations on the management of superficial and perforating vein incompetence in patients with associated, more
advanced chronic venous diseases (CVDs), including edema, skin changes, or venous ulcers. Recommendations of the
Venous Guideline Committee are based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation
(GRADE) system as strong (GRADE 1) if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, burden, and costs. The suggestions are
weak (GRADE 2) if the benefits are closely balanced with risks and burden. The level of available evidence to support the
evaluation or treatment can be of high (A), medium (B), or low or very low (C) quality. The key recommendations of
these guidelines are: We recommend that in patients with varicose veins or more severe CVD, a complete history and
detailed physical examination are complemented by duplex ultrasound scanning of the deep and superficial veins
