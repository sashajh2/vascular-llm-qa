 with 3.6%, 4.0%, and 5.4% among those
who had undergone CEA at 3 to 7, 8 to 14, and 15 to
180 days after the acute neurologic event, respectively.
A multivariate analysis demonstrated that patients
who underwent CEA within the ﬁrst 2 days after an
acute neurologic event experienced a relative OR of
4.24 (95% CI, 2.07-8.70; P < .001) for perioperative complications compared with those undergoing surgery
within 3 to 7 days.58 These data were corroborated by
Hasan et al14 in their meta-analysis concerning the
timing of the intervention after index stroke. Avgerinos
et al60 demonstrated an increased risk of complications
if CEA were performed within 48 hours of the index
event (RR, 2.3053) for stroke but no difference between
2 and 14 days. This short delay could allow for a more
complete patient evaluation and to allow the symptoms
to stabilize and plateau.
The preponderance of evidence indicates that CEA performed early (<2 weeks) after an acute stroke is preferable
to a delay of 4 to 6 weeks to CEA.61-67 The data on CAS in
the setting of acute stroke are scant, even in the recent
meta-analysis by Hasan et al.14 Most reports were based
on anecdotal studies; thus, we could not draw any signiﬁcant conclusions regarding the beneﬁts of CAS for acute
strokes with carotid-based lesions. At present, CEA is the
procedure of choice for patients with stable strokes and
>50% carotid bifurcation stenosis.
Recommendations for management of acute neurologic syndrome
3.1: For patients with a recent stable stroke (modiﬁed
Rankin scale score, 0-2), we recommend carotid revascularization for symptomatic patients with >50% stenosis to be performed as soon as the patient is
neurologically stable after 48 hours but deﬁnitely
before 14 days after the onset of symptoms (grade IB).
3.2: For patients undergoing revascularization within
the ﬁ
