 within 1 year, with 3
endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHITs) and no
major complications. Only 23% needed additional
treatments.135 Cost was signiﬁcantly lower when
compared with RFA procedures performed in a day
surgery setting.135 Combining thermal ablation and other
venous treatments such as phlebectomy and sclerotherapy during the same procedure is also safe and
effective. Jarjous et al treated 72 extremities in 63
consecutive patients with RFA of the truncal and perforator veins, combined with UGFS procedures of tributary

and accessory veins.136 They reported 100% closure of the
treated GSV and SSV and 91.7% closure of tributary veins,
13.9% needed additional treatment and there were no
major or minor complications.136 Lin et al reported on
3073 ofﬁce-based venous procedures: 285 saphenous
vein ablations, 185 miniphlebectomies, and 261 venous
ablations with concomitant miniphlebectomy.137 Overall
technical success was 99.2%, with a complication rate of
1%.137 There are a few studies that looked at patient
satisfaction in an ofﬁce setting compared with an operating room setting. Varetto et al treated 112 patients with
GSV insufﬁciency. Approximately one-half underwent
EVLA in day-surgery and one-half in an outpatient ofﬁce-

based setting. There was no statistical difference in the
postoperative success or complications between the two
groups.138 QOL measures did not signiﬁcantly differ between groups, except for the >65-year-old group, which
demonstrated better QOL in ofﬁce-based setting
compared with the day surgery group.138 Another prospective study sent questionnaires to patients who underwent endovenous ablation with concomitant
phlebectomy in the ofﬁce-based
