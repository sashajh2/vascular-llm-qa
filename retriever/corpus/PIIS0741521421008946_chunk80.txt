 reduction in:
Ipsilateral stroke (1.5% vs 4.5%; P ¼ .001)
Carotid thrombosis (0.5% vs 3.1%; P < .0011)
Return to operating room (3.1% vs 1.1%; P ¼ .01)
Long-term outcome reduction in:
Ipsilateral stroke (1.6% vs 4.8%; P ¼ .001)
Any stroke (1.4% vs 4.6%; P ¼ .002)
Rate of restenosis (4.3% vs 13.8%; P < .01)

Systemic analysis
of RCTs

Cao et al, 2001294

5 RCTs
2,590 CEAs (2,465 patients)

ECEA vs CCEA:
Perioperative stroke/death rate of 2.1% (1.7% vs
2.6%)
No signiﬁcant differences in rate of early carotid
thrombosis, MI and local complications:
Neck hematoma (4.2% vs 5.5%)
CNI (3.8% vs 5.6%)
No signiﬁcant difference in restenosis at later
follow-up (1-69 months) or stroke rate (2.0% vs
2.4%)
