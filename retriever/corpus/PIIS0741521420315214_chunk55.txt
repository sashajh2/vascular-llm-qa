 these circumstances include the following:
Presence of a patent LIMA to coronary artery bypass graft
Termination of the left vertebral artery into the posterior
inferior cerebellar artery
Absent, atretic, or occluded right vertebral artery
Patent left arm arteriovenous shunt for dialysis
Prior infrarenal aortic operation or EVAR with previously
ligated or covered lumbar and middle sacral arteries
Planned extensive coverage ($15 cm) of the DTA
Hypogastric artery occlusion or signiﬁcant occlusive
disease
Presence of aneurysm disease in the young patient, for
whom future therapy involving the distal thoracic aorta
may be necessary
Recommendation 21: For patients with acute thoracic
emergencies, for whom TEVAR is required urgently and
coverage of the LSA is necessary, it is suggested that

revascularization be individualized and addressed on
the basis of the patient’s anatomy and urgency of the
procedure. Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Renal protection strategies for TEVAR
Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurring during hospitalization
or after surgery has one of the highest risks of predicting
mortality, especially if the AKI progresses to dialysis. When
AKI occurs after TEVAR (w10%-15%), it increases the OR of
death to almost 10 even without a need for dialysis.158,159
Many risk factors for AKI are associated with patients undergoing TEVAR (advanced age, chronic renal failure, diabetes,
congestive heart failure, exposure to injectable contrast
dye, blood loss, major surgery) and possibly embolic injury
from endovascular manipulation within the aorta.
Importantly, contrast-induced nephropathy is the third
leading cause of AKI in hospitalized patients. Although it
is plagued with inconsistent deﬁnitions in the literature,
its incidence varies between 5% and 25%. Factors consistently shown to increase risk for contrast-induced nephropathy include age, diabetes, previous renal disease,
and escalating doses of contrast material.159-161
Strategies reported to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy are also marred by inconsistent reporting
standards and patient risk factors.160,1
