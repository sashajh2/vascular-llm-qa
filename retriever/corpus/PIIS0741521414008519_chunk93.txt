Guideline 5.3: Multicomponent Compression
Bandage
We suggest the use of multicomponent compression bandage over single-component bandages for the
treatment of venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL
OF EVIDENCE - B]
The possible difference in healing outcomes between
single-layer and multilayer compression bandages has
been evaluated in four trials, three of which have been published. In two trials, the number of participants was small
(n ¼ 27 and 34) and showed no difference between treatment groups.279,294,295 However, a large RCT with 245
patients demonstrated improved healing at 24 weeks
(67% vs 49%; P ¼ .009) in the multilayer (4LB) bandage
group compared with the single-layer group.296 In addition, 4LB were associated with faster wound closure (78
vs 168 days; P ¼ .001) compared with the single-layer
group.
A recent meta-analysis identiﬁed six trials directly
comparing multicomponent bandages containing elastic
with those not containing elastic. Data from 797 patients
(ﬁve trials with independent patient data available) demonstrated 30% improved healing with 4LB compared with
those with SSB (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.09-1.58;
P ¼ .0005).297 These data might in part be explained by
the skill of the health care professional in achieving optimal
sub-bandage pressures and graduated compression. In
comparing 4LB with SSB in countries where the medical
staff is familiar with applying SSB (eg, Netherlands and
Austria), there was no signiﬁcant difference between the ulcer healing rates after 3 months (33 of 53 ¼ 62% healed
with 4LB vs 43 of 59 ¼ 73% with SSB).297-299 Studies
comparing different versions of the 4LB (proprietary and
nonproprietary) were similar in outcomes, and thus a speciﬁc 4LB is not endorsed.3
