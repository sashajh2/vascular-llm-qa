only to intracranial hemorrhage.1,2 It has been estimated
that less than 25% of patients with such an injury live to be
evaluated in a hospital,3 and of those who do, up to 50%
will die within 24 hours.4 Given the location of injury in
50% to 70% of cases,4 conventional surgical repair typically
involves a high posterolateral thoracotomy with or without
cardiopulmonary bypass and significant blood loss, which
can negatively impact the pulmonary, cardiac, and neurologic status of the patient. Historically, open repair of
traumatic aortic injuries has been associated with a 28%
mortality rate5 and a 16% paraplegia rate.6 There has been
a risk of delayed rupture in the unrepaired thoracic transection that has been estimated to be 2% to 5%.7
Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is a rapidly evolving therapy in the treatment of a variety of thoracic aortic pathologies. TEVAR involves placing an endovascular stent graft into the
