In patients with a small aneurysm (4.0 cm to 5.4 cm) who will
require chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or solid organ
transplantation, we suggest a shared decision-making

Medical management during the period of aneurysm
surveillance
In the presence of a small aortic aneurysm, several
approaches have been proposed to prevent further
enlargement.47 Smoking cessation is the most important
intervention for a patient with an aneurysm.9,272,273,283,284
Hemodynamic control with propranolol has not been
shown to inhibit aneurysm expansion.285,286 Despite the
beneﬁts of statins in cardiovascular disease, their ability
to limit aneurysm expansion is lacking.287-290 ACE inhibitors and losartan, an angiotensin receptor antagonist,
decrease the rate of AAA expansion in mice, but clinical
investigations have reported conﬂicting results.291,292
Clinical trials of b-adrenergic receptor blockade demonstrate no effect on the rate of aneurysm progression.285,286 Likewise, beta blockade, lipid-lowering
agents, and angiotensin receptor blockade do not
appear to alter rupture risk, but an increased risk of
rupture has been reported for patients who recently discontinued ACE inhibitors.293
Some have suggested that serologic evidence of Chlamydophila pneumoniae infection may be associated
with AAA expansion,294 but a prospective randomized
trial demonstrated that azithromycin had no effect on
aneurysm enlargement.295 Doxycycline can inhibit
matrix metalloproteinases in plasma and an
