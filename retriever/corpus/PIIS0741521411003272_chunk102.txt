asation
may cause skin ulcers and tissue necrosis, and osmotic
agents are used for occlusion of small veins only.
Detergents. Detergents destroy the endothelium by
denaturation of the cell surface proteins. STS (as Sotrade-

col, Bioniche Pharma USA, Lake Forest, Ill; Fibro-Vein,
STD Pharmaceutical Products Ltd, Hereford, UK; Tromboject, Omega Laboratories) is a long-chain fatty alcohol.
A critical micellar concentration is needed to cause endothelial cell injury, and repeated treatments are frequently
desirable. The solution is safe and painless when injected.
When the solution is injected in higher concentration,
extravasation may result in tissue necrosis. Hyperpigmentation, matting, and allergic reactions have been described.
Foaming of this agent is easy and will result in longer
exposure of the agent to the vein wall using a smaller
amount of the solution.
Polidocanol (Asclera injection, Bioform Medical Inc,
San Mateo, Calif), another detergent, was approved for use
in the United States in 2010. This is the most commonly
used sclerotherapy agent in the world; it is safe and painless
when injected, with a low risk of tissue necrosis when used
in a low concentration. It may cause hyperpigmentation,
but has a very low rate of allergic or anaphylactic reaction.
Morrhuate sodium (Scleromate, Glenwood, LLC,
Englewood, NJ) is a detergent that is used less frequently
because of the relatively higher incidence of skin necrosis
observed with extravasation and because of the higher risk
of anaphylactic reactions.
