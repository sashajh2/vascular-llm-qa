Because involvement of the iliofemoral venous segments is associated with worse outcomes, the most proximal extent of thrombus should be clearly defined in the
clinical management of patients as well as in research
studies and clinical trials. Routine use of the term proximal venous thrombosis should be discouraged in favor
of more precise characterization of these thrombi as
involving the iliofemoral or femoropopliteal venous
segments.
1.2. If iliofemoral venous thrombosis is suspected
but not confirmed using standard diagnostic modalities
such as venous ultrasound imaging, we recommend the
use of adjunctive imaging modalities, such as computed
tomography venography or magnetic resonance venography to characterize the most proximal thrombus extent (Grade 1C). Several strategies for the diagnosis of
DVT, incorporating combinations of clinical risk stratification,33,34 measurement of D-dimer levels,35-39 and venous
ultrasound imaging, have been developed. As a component
of such strategies, venous ultrasound imaging has become
the most important diagnostic test for acute DVT. Compared with venography, accuracy studies have shown duplex has a mean sensitivity and specificity of 97% and 94%,
with mean positive and negative predictive values of 97%
and 98% for symptomatic, proximal DVT.40 Unfortunately, many ultrasound departments do not routinely evaluate the iliac veins, and even if examined, adequate imaging
of these segments is often limited by body habitus, depth,
overlying bowel gas, and incompressibility of the retroperitoneal veins. Although visualization of at least one iliac

vein segment has been reported in up to 79% of ultrasound
studies, the common iliac vein was adequately imaged in
only 47%.41
Indirect findings in the common femoral vein, including continuous venous flow, absent respiratory variation,
and continuous flow with Valsalva, may suggest proximal
obstruction but cannot exclude nonocclusive thrombus or
extrinsic compression. Contrast venography may similarly
fail to demonstrate the pelvic veins due to contrast dilution
by the unopacified deep pelvic veins.42
Because multiple venous segments are usually
