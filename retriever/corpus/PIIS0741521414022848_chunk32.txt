 such advanced disease and disability
that meaningful participation in an exercise program is not

realistic. In addition, although supervised exercise programs
are the most effective and well-studied form of exercise
therapy, many U.S. insurance carriers do not currently
provide beneﬁts for participation in such programs. At present, this represents a major obstacle to the use of exercise
therapy for IC in clinical practice.
Components of an exercise program for IC. Exercise programs for IC potentially consist of various forms
of lower extremity exercise alone or in combination
(walking, running, cycling, etc) or upper extremity exercise, or both, and vary with respect to intervals of training,
duration of training, intensity of training, and claudication
end points. Programs may be self-directed, supervised, of
varying intensity, institution based or home based, and

may be combined with medical or interventional therapies, or both. A classic meta-analysis of the potential
components of an exercise program for IC determined the
greatest effects were achieved with a >6 month walking
program that had at least three sessions per week of durations >30 minutes per session that used nearly maximal
claudication pain as the claudication pain end point.
Claudication pain end point, mode of exercise (walking),
and duration of the exercise program were all independent predictors of increased walking distance with an
exercise program.108
Type, duration, and intensity of exercise. The superiority of walking over other forms of lower extremity exercise, including cycling, stair climbing, tiptoe raises, dancing,
and static and dynamic leg exercises, has been demonstrated.111 Moreover, neither lower extremity strength
training nor upper extremity aerobic exercise appear to
augment responses to a walking exercise program.109 Lowintensity exercise appears as equally effective as highintensity exercise in improving claudication parameters,
provided the duration of exercise is extended in the lowintensity group to achieve similar levels of exercise exposure.110 However, use claudication end points of nearly
maximal pain vs onset of pain does appear to produce
greater changes in distance to onset and maximal pain.108
Data supporting nearly maximal pain during exercise are
derived from time to maximal claudication pain achieved
with treadmill testing and may actually underestimate bene
