 alone (Sidawy and Perler 2023e). After the GSV is ligated at
the SFJ, a vein stripper is passed distally and a second incision is made near the knee. The
GSV is then tied to the stripper and both the stripper and the vein are drawn out through
the distal incision, stripping in a downward direction, avulsing its tributaries and removing
it from circulation. Top-down passage of the stripper minimizes the potential for saphenous
nerve injury as well as unintentional passage of the stripper into the femoral vein through a
thigh perforator (Sidawy and Perler 2023e).
Stab Phlebectomy
Stab phlebectomy, also known as ambulatory phlebectomy, is a technique used to remove
residual superficial varicosities following endovenous ablation or high ligation and stripping
(HLS) of the great saphenous vein (GSV) or small saphenous vein (SSV). These residual
varicosities, if not addressed, can continue to drain via alternative pathways, remaining both
symptomatic and cosmetically displeasing. The procedure involves making small 1-3 mm
incisions through which varicose veins are hooked, extracted, and removed. This method
has largely replaced older techniques that left larger scars, as these smaller incisions typically
heal with minimal scarring and do not usually require sutures. The phlebectomy not only
improves aesthetic outcomes but also helps alleviate symptoms by removing venous pressure
from untreated tributaries (Sidawy and Perler 2023e).
Sclerotherapy
Injection sclerotherapy is a minimally invasive percutaneous technique that uses chemical
irritants to close unwanted superficial veins. Primarily employed in the treatment of telangiectasias, reticular veins, and small nonaxial varicose veins less than 6 mm in diameter, sclerotherapy can address both symptomatic and asymptomatic veins. This method involves injecting

for smaller veins, larger varicosities may require foam sclerotherapy, which uses
