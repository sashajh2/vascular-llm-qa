 event is typically caused by atherosclerotic occlusive disease at the oriﬁces of the mesenteric vessels (ie,
celiac artery [CA], superior mesenteric artery [SMA], inferior mesenteric artery [IMA]), although a variety of other
etiologies have been incriminated. The presence of
mesenteric artery occlusive disease (MAOD) is a relatively
common ﬁnding in the elderly population, particularly in
those with evidence of occlusive disease in other vascular
beds. In a prospective study of more than 500 patients,
Wilson et al1 reported that 17% of elderly adults had evidence of signiﬁcant occlusive disease in the CA or SMA.
Furthermore, more than 25% of patients undergoing a
catheter-based arteriogram for lower extremity occlusive
disease were found to have a greater than 50% stenosis
in either artery.2,3 Despite the high prevalence of
MAOD, CMI is signiﬁcantly less common given the extensive collateral network and redundancy in the mesenteric circulation. It is generally accepted that symptoms

do not occur unless at least two of the mesenteric vessels
are involved although symptoms can develop in patients
with single-vessel disease, particularly the SMA.4-7 The
diagnosis of CMI requires the appropriate clinical symptoms, the presence of MAOD, and the exclusion of other
potential causes of postprandial abdominal pain. Deﬁnitive treatment with mesenteric revascularization is
required with the treatment goals of reversing the symptoms, facilitating weight gain, improving the overall quality of life, and preventing bowel infarction.
Both the diagnostic imaging and deﬁnitive treatment
for CMI have evolved over the past 2 decades, paralleling
the larger discipline of vascular surgery, with an increased
emphasis on triphasic multidetector CT arteriography
(CTA) and percutaneous endovascular treatment. CTA is
currently recommended as the ﬁrst-line imaging study
for mesenteric ischemia (both acute and chronic) by the
American College of Radiology Appropriateness criteria
and has largely replaced catheter-based arteriography as
the gold standard for diagnosis
