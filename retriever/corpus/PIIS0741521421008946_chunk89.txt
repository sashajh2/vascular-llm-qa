 the ICA.
Several randomized trials compared conventional CEA
(CCEA) with eversion,311-317 and all provided Level 1 evidence conﬁrming the equivalence of ECEA and CCEA
with patching in regard to perioperative results. The
largest Level 1 study was a multicenter randomized trial
comparing CCEA and eversion came from the EVERsion
CEA vs Standard Trial (EVEREST) (1353 patients).314,315 Risk
of 30-day perioperative major stroke/death was similar
for both groups at 1.3%. The risk of 30-day all stroke was
also similar: 1.9% for CCEA vs 2.2% for ECEA (P ¼ .80).
At 33 months, carotid restenosis rate was noted in 2.8%
with eversion, 7.9% for primary closure and 1.5% for CEA
with patching. The cumulative, 4-year postcarotid stenosis was lower in the ECEA comparted to primary closure:
3.6% vs 9.2% (P ¼ .01). However, the difference in postCEA stenosis was comparable when eversion was
compared with patching (2.8% for eversion vs 1.5% for
patching). There was no signiﬁcant difference in cumulative risk of ipsilateral stroke (2.2% for standard vs 3.9% for
eversion; P ¼ .2) or death (13.1% vs 12.7%). Of 18 variables
that were analyzed for their effect on risk of post-CEA stenosis, ECEA (HR, 0.3; P ¼ .0004) and patch CEA (HR, 0.2;
P ¼ .002) were negative predictors (protective) of postCEA stenosis. Also, in the CREST trial, patients undergoing eversion endarterectomy had lower risk of cranial
nerve injuries than those with patched CEA.
Observational studies also show somewhat similar results. Shah et al321 reported data on one of the largest
