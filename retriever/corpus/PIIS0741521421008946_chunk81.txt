25 studies (20 Observational
Studies, 5 RCTs)
49,500 CEAs (33,251
CCEAs/16,249 ECEAs)

RCT Data
CCEA, ECEA did not confer signiﬁcant reductions in 30 day perioperative stroke, death,
stroke/death, stroke/death/MI or neck
hematoma
ECEA was associated with reduced late restenosis (OR, 0.40; P ¼ .001)
OS Data
ECEA (compared with CCEA) associated with
signiﬁcant reduction in:
30-day perioperative stroke (OR, 0.58; P < .0001)
Death (OR, 0.46; P < .0001)
Stroke/death (OR, 0.52; P < .0001)
Stroke/death/MI (OR, 0.50; P < .0001)
Late restenosis (OR, 0.49; P ¼ .032)
RCT and OS Data Combined
ECEA (compared with CCEA) associated with
signiﬁcant reduction in:
30-day death (OR, 0.55; P < .0001)
Stroke (OR, 0.63; P ¼ .004)
Stroke/death (OR, 0.58; P < .0001)
Late restenosis (OR, 0.45; P ¼ .004)
ECEA vs patched CCEA: there were no differences between the two procedures, except for
neck hematoma, where ECEA was better than
patched CCEA
