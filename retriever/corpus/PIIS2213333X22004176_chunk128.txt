Post-thrombotic syndrome

Chronic venous symptoms and/or signs secondary to deep vein thrombosis and its sequelae

Primary venous reﬂux

Retrograde venous ﬂow of abnormal duration in any venous segment, caused by idiopathic
venous valve dysfunction

Reticular veins

Dilated bluish subdermal veins ranging from 1 to <3 mm in diameter and usually tortuous; this
excludes normal visible veins in people with thin, transparent skin; synonyms include blue
veins, subdermal varices, and venulectasias; in CEAP classiﬁcation, reticular veins are part of C1
clinical class

Secondary venous reﬂux

Retrograde venous ﬂow of abnormal duration in any venous segment, caused by thrombosis,

Sclerotherapy

Telangiectasia

Small, dilated, ﬂat, thin-walled, blue or red veins <1 mm in diameter seen near skin surface;
numerous telangiectasias near foot and ankle are termed corona phlebectatica; commonly
termed spider veins, they are distinguished from reticular veins by having no proﬁle; however,
telangiectasia, spider veins, and reticular veins are all classiﬁed as C1 using the CEAP
classiﬁcation

Tessari technique

Method of producing foam for immediate use by agitating liquid sclerosant with a gas at a
predeﬁned ratio using two interconnected syringes, which are
