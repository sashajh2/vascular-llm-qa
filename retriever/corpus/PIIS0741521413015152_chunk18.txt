 50%-80% range. Both the Eurodiale53,54 and
Circulase trial11 data conﬁrm that infection is frequently
the trigger to amputation in patients with a threatened
limb. Infection appears to be especially detrimental in
patients with PAD compared with those with normal
perfusion. In fact, the combination of infection and PAD
in the Eurodiale study tripled the likelihood of wound nonhealing.54 Infection can augment the need for perfusion
both by increased metabolic activity and small vessel
thrombosis attributable to angiotoxic enzymes. Worsening
severity of ischemia likely further increases amputation risk
in the presence of infection, although the severity of
ischemia was not speciﬁed in Eurodiale. Despite the clear
importance of infection in the pathway toward major
limb amputation in patients with lower extremity wounds
and PAD, infection is not even mentioned in the TASC,
Rutherford, or Fontaine classiﬁcation systems. Therefore,
we adapted the IDSA system into WIfI (Table II). The

ISCHEMIA GRADES
Ischemia in many DFU schemes is deﬁned as an
ABI <0.8 and is considered as a simpliﬁed 6 variable
without gradations of severity. Multiple studies suggest
that patients with ABI >0.8 are at lower risk for amputation and unlikely to require revascularization to achieve
healing.34,44,54 In these patients, wound and infection
severity are the major determinants of amputation risk.
Patients with ABI >0.8 were therefore classiﬁed as
ischemia grade 0. At the other end of the perfusion
