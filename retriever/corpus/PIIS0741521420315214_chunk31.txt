 rupture, preoperative imaging should
be adequate to evaluate whether the patient’s anatomy
is amenable to endovascular repair. This typically consists
of CTA of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (from above the
clavicles to the femoral heads) to evaluate the proximal
and distal seal zones and to evaluate for vascular access
options. If coverage of the LSA is planned, CTA through
the head and neck is useful to determine the anatomy
of the vertebral arteries. In addition, identiﬁcation of
blood or effusions in the thoracic cavity may suggest
that the lesion to be treated is acute in nature. CTA
may also be useful in the setting of aortoesophageal
and aortobronchial ﬁstulas to determine the best way
to approach the patient and to determine additional interventions (eg, esophagectomy, lung resection) that
may be needed.
Elective repair. Preoperative evaluation in the elective
setting consists of cardiac risk stratiﬁcation and includes
weighing of the patient’s inherent clinical risk with the
risk of surgery. This algorithm is well detailed in the
2014 ACC/AHA guideline on perioperative cardiovascular
evaluation and management of patients undergoing
noncardiac surgery.2
Assessment of left ventricular function
Recommendation 3: For elective TEVAR cases, we suggest assessment of left ventricular function by transthoracic echocardiography in a patient with dyspnea of
unknown origin or in a patient with known congestive
heart failure with worsening dyspnea. Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C
(Low)
Additional testing
Practice Statement: Although there are few supporting data, in trying to determine whether a patient with
severe COPD is a candidate for open TAA repair or
TEVAR, the committee recommends considering pulmonary function testing preoperatively in an attempt
to determine baseline pulmonary function, especially if
general endotracheal anesthesia is being considered,
to determine risk of ventilator dependency postoperatively and ultimately to guide the choice of anesthesia
