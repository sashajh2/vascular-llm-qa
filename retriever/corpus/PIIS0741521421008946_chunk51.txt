 Both NASCET and ECST
demonstrated the beneﬁt of CEA in neurologically symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis that reduced
diameter of greater than 50%.28,37,168 NASCET demonstrated an absolute risk reduction of stroke of 17% at
2 years (24% in medical arm vs 7% in surgical arm) for
patients with a greater than 70% carotid stenosis. The
ECST demonstrated a similar decrease in stroke risk in
symptomatic patients after 3 years. The stroke risk in the
medical arm was 26.5%, compared with 14.9% in the
surgical group, an absolute reduction of 11.6%.37 In both
studies, the risk of stroke in the medical arm, and
therefore the beneﬁt of CEA, increased with degree of
stenosis. The results of these trials established CEA as the
treatment of choice for patients with severe carotid stenosis, and they are widely accepted throughout the
medical community. At 5 years, the beneﬁt of CEA
among patients with stenosis of 50% to 69% was more
moderate, but still statistically signiﬁcantda 15.7% stroke
rate after CEA vs 22.2% with medical therapy.168 Stenoses
of less than 50% do not beneﬁt from CEA.
Transfemoral CAS in symptomatic stenosis. A number of trials examined transfemoral CAS in management

of neurologically symptomatic patients with a greater
than 50% diameter stenosis. Several early trials in high
surgical risk patients such as Stenting and Angioplasty
with Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE), demonstrated overall equivalence of
transfemoral CAS and CEA in management of carotid
stenosis, although the number of symptomatic patients
was too small for subgroup analysis.201 Two large randomized European trials, Endarterectomy vs Angioplasty
in Patients with Symptomatic Severe Carotid Stenosis
(EVA-3S)7 and Stent Protected Angioplasty vs
