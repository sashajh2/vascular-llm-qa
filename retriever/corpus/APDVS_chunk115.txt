Key Facts
1. Chronic venous disease (CVD) is highly prevalent in the United States, affecting
25% of women and 15% of men, with 1% to 4% progressing to advanced stages such
as chronic venous insuﬀciency (CVI) with venous ulcers.
2. The economic burden of CVD is substantial, with estimated annual healthcare costs
in the US ranging from $1.9 to $3 billion, primarily impacting Medicare.
3. CVD arises from venous hypertension due to valvular incompetence, thrombotic
obstruction, or extrinsic compression, leading to manifestations such as edema,
hyperpigmentation, and venous ulcers.
4. Superficial, deep, and perforating veins play crucial roles in venous circulation,
with dysfunctional valves in the great saphenous vein commonly causing significant
venous refux.
5. Duplex ultrasound is the primary diagnostic tool for CVD, assessing venous obstruction and refux. The Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification system categorizes disease severity based on clinical manifestations and
pathophysiology.
6. The Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) complements CEAP for evaluating dis-

ease progression and treatment outcomes.
7. Management of CVD includes conservative approaches (compression therapy), pharmacological interventions, and various procedures including endovenous ablation,
phlebectomy, and sclerotherapy.
8. Endovenous treatments such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and endovenous
laser ablation (EVLA) are preferred over traditional surgeries due to lower morbidity and quicker recovery times.
9. Surgical interventions significantly improve quality of life and symptom relief compared to conservative therapies for severe CVD.
10. Long-term surveillance with duplex ultrasound is essential to monitor disease progression and recurrence post-treatment, with early intervention shown to accelerate
ulcer healing and reduce recurrence rates.
