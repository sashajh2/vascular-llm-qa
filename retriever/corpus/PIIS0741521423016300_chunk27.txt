Rationale. PAD is present in approximately half of the
people with a DFU.29,30 Therefore, in any person with
diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene, PAD should be
considered and should be excluded with the appropriate diagnostic strategies. Subsequently, once diagnosed the second question is whether the PAD is of
sufﬁcient severity to contribute to delayed wound healing and increased risk of amputation. This will inform
whether further investigation or intervention is required.
In addition, although cardiovascular risk factor modiﬁcation is always indicated in people with diabetes, those
with symptomatic PAD (i.e., including those with a DFU)
belong to the very high cardiovascular risk category and

need more intensive risk treatment, as described in the
‘Treatment’ section.
Apart from taking a clinical history, all people with a DFU
or gangrene should undergo a complete physical examination, including palpation of the lower limb pulses which
can help to determine the presence of arterial disease.55 In
the systematic review on diagnosis, one low quality study
that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of pedal pulse
assessment in a population where all participants had a
DFU was identiﬁed.56 Pulse palpation had a PLR of 1.38
and a NLR 0.75 for PAD in people presenting with a foot ulcer.56 These likelihood ratios represent a very small ability
of the test to identify or exclude disease. Pulse palpation
should be seen as the ﬁrst step in a systematic evaluation
of the affected limb and foot, but when DFU is present
further diagnostic procedures should be performed with
non-invasive bedside testing techniques as clinical examination is not sufﬁcient to exclude PAD. Although of
limited value it should not be discarded as in the early
phase of management other tests are sometimes unavailable, or ﬁndings may be difﬁcult to interpret. The evidence
base is small with low certainty but as previously discussed
this form of testing has low resource requirements
