17 In patients with spontaneous dissection of the visceral arteries, aneurysmal
degeneration is rare.120,121 There is no evidence to suggest

tomatic at presentation as opposed to 30% of 20 true aneurysms. Pitton et al92 reported a review of 233 patients
with 253 visceral artery aneurysms. The rate of rupture
at presentation was noted to be signiﬁcantly higher in
visceral pseudoaneurysms than in true aneurysms
(76.3% vs 3.1%). There were 35 ruptures in their series.
There was no signiﬁcant difference in size between
ruptured and nonruptured visceral aneurysms. The authors concluded that visceral pseudoaneurysms are at
increased risk for rupture and that diameter is not necessarily a reliable predictor of rupture.92
In an additional series of 155 patients with visceral
aneurysms, Guo et al122 found no signiﬁcant difference
of the diameters between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (36.9 vs 33.6 mm). Pseudoaneurysms
were more common in the patients who presented
with rupture. Symptomatic patients had a signiﬁcantly
higher 30-day mortality.122 Celiac aneurysms were
more likely to be in the symptomatic group, whereas
splenic aneurysms were more likely to be in the
asymptomatic group. Most of the ruptures were in
pseudoaneurysms (80%).122 Of a total of eight celiac
lesions, ﬁve were symptomatic. Tetreau et al123
reviewed 112 patients with splanchnic aneurysms,
including 44 splenic aneurysms and 6 celiac aneurysms. Of the celiac aneurysms, one was ruptured at
a diameter of 17 mm.

In the appropriate clinical scenario, speciﬁcally in patients with pancreatitis or infected pancreatic pseudocysts, coexisting CAAs should be suspected
