iﬁcation. Regarding recurrence, our
commissioned comparative systematic review and metaanalysis included two RCTs, and each study favored
surgery plus compression over compression alone to a
statistically signiﬁcant degree for prevention of ulcer
recurrence.288,317,318 Because each study had some challenges in design and baseline imbalance, the strength
and grade of evidence is 1B.
Regarding the choice of method of saphenous ablation, there are multiple RCTs showing strong and consistent evidence that modern open surgery, radiofrequency,
and laser ablation are equivalent in effect and safety
(Table IX).319-330 Endovenous ablation can be extrapolated to be as effective as open ligation and stripping
used in these earlier trials. Moreover, endovenous ablation
can be carried out under local/tumescent anesthesia as an
ofﬁce-based procedure, which shifts the risk/beneﬁt ratio
signiﬁcantly. Foam sclerotherapy has been demonstrated
to rival these modalities and has signiﬁcantly more recanalizations and reﬂuxing treated segments on follow-up
