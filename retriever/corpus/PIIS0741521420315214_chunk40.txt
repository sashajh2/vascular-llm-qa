Recommendation 10: In patients who could undergo
either technique (within the criteria of the device’s instructions for use), we recommend TEVAR as the
preferred approach to treat elective DTA aneurysms,
given its reduced morbidity and length of stay as well
as short-term mortality. Level of recommendation:
Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High)
Indications for repair
TEVAR for TAA. Untreated 6.0-cm TAAs have a 5-year
survival of 54%, yielding a 3.7%/y risk for rupture and a
risk of dying of w12%/y.25,96 A prospective database of
>1600 TAAs and ADs found that an aneurysmal thoracic
aorta grows an average of 0.10 cm/y (0.07 cm for the
ascending aorta and 0.19 cm for the DTA).22,96 In saccular
aneurysms, which may have a higher risk of rupture,
TEVAR may be justiﬁed at a diameter <6.0 cm even
though high-quality data are not readily available. Data
suggesting that lower thresholds for repair of the DTA in
women are also not readily available as aneurysm disease in the thoracic aorta is rarer than in the abdominal
aorta. In making treatment recommendations, the patient’s overall medical condition and risk proﬁle should
be considered. For patients at higher risk for elective
repair, a larger aortic diameter threshold may be more
appropriate in considering their expected surgical
complication rate. In addition, data are lacking regarding
rapid aneurysm expansion and what size threshold over
time is considered accelerated growth. Therefore, TEVAR
based on “rapid expansion” should be individualized and

should take into account the comorbidities of the patients, their expected longevity, and risk factors for a poor
outcome after TEVAR.
Recommendation 11: We recommend TEVAR in
asymptomatic patients with a descending TAA when
the maximum aneurysm diameter exceeds 5.5 cm in
“low-risk” patients with favorable aortic anatomy. Level
of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
