 vegetables, and lean protein, are
associated with reduced PAD risk.
 Metabolic Syndrome: Metabolic syndrome, which encompasses a cluster of conditions
such as obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia, is a potent risk factor
for PAD. The interplay of these factors significantly increases the risk of atherosclerosis
and impaired arterial perfusion.
 Gender and Menopause: Men generally exhibit a higher prevalence of PAD, although
the risk in women increases post-menopause. Reduced estrogen levels post-menopause
contribute to endothelial dysfunction and alterations in lipid profiles, increasing susceptibility to PAD.

 Race and Ethnicity: Certain racial and ethnic groups, such as African Americans, are
more prone to developing PAD. Genetic and environmental factors may contribute to
these disparities.
 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): Reduced kidney function is associated with PAD,
partly due to endothelial dysfunction and systemic infammation. CKD patients are at
increased risk of atherosclerosis, uncontrolled hypertension, thrombotic complications,
and progressive PAD.

Vessel Collaterization
Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) often develop collateralization of blood vessels
as a compensatory mechanism to improve perfusion to tissues affected by reduced blood fow.
These new blood vessels, or collaterals, bypass or supplement the obstructed arteries and
combat oxygen starvation of the tissues through “collateral circulation.” The main drivers for
the development of collateral vessels in PAD are as follows:
 Ischemia and Hypoxia: In PAD, atherosclerosis narrows and sometimes occludes
the arteries that supply blood to the limbs. The resulting reduced blood fow causes
tissue ischemia (insuﬀcient blood supply) and hypoxia (insuﬀcient oxygen supply) to
the tissues distal to the narrowing or occlusion. To combat this, the body initiates a
response to create alternate pathways for blood fow.
 Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs): When cells are deprived of oxygen (as in the case
of PAD), they activate hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). HIFs are transcription factors
such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF).
These factors promote the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis (the formation
of new blood vessels) and arteriogenesis (the remodeling and
