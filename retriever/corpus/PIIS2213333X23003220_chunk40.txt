2. Compression therapy
2.1. Compression therapy vs intervention.
2.1.1. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the superﬁcial truncal veins, we suggest compression therapy for primary treatment if the
patient’s ambulatory status or underlying medical conditions warrant a conservative approach or, if the patient prefers conservative treatment, for either a trial
period or deﬁnitive management.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
Rationale. In patients with varicose veins, compression
therapy has been used for decades to decrease pain and
swelling. Graduated elastic compression stockings
oppose tissue expansion when muscles contract. It can
narrow the superﬁcial veins diameter and therefore
decrease the venous reﬂux and venous hypertension,
key elements in the pathophysiology of CVD.
Evidence. The clinical beneﬁt of compression stockings
for the initial treatment of varicose veins has been studied in a recent Cochrane review of 13 trials, encompassing
>1000 patients88 (Table III). Compression stockings were
compared with no stockings or placebo stockings.88 Four
RCTs showed improvement in symptoms, but they were
subject to bias. Three of the four studies reported side
effects of discomfort, appearance, and application difﬁculty. The beneﬁts of stockings were offset by highly
variable reports of compliance, presumably due to the
most common side effects of itching and irritation.
