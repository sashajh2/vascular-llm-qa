 percutaneous coronary procedures. The American College of Cardiology Perioperative
Guidelines endorses continuation of aspirin during the
period surrounding CEA.443 The risk of periprocedural
MI from aspirin withdrawal likely outweighs risk of severe
bleeding from aspirin continuation.3 Patients on clopidogrel may require individualized management. Clopidogrel may be safely continued through the
perioperative period without a signiﬁcantly increased
risk of major bleeding.165 Discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy may signiﬁcantly increase risk of coronary stent thrombosis and MI, particularly in the setting
of drug-eluting stents.444
Preoperative statin therapy can signiﬁcantly reduce
perioperative mortality and MI after CEA.152,153 In a systematic review and meta-analysis, statin users undergoing CEA were at signiﬁcantly lower risk of perioperative
death compared with statin-naïve patients.445 However,
a corresponding difference in risk of perioperative MI
was not observed. Nevertheless, use of perioperative
statin medications is generally recommended.
Labile blood pressure is common in the postoperative
period following CEA. Aggressive monitoring and appropriate pharmacologic treatment of both hypotension
and hypertension is recommended to reduce risk of
related morbidity, including myocardial ischemia. For
patients with known severe preexisting coronary artery
disease, obtaining routine postoperative electrocardiograms and cardiac enzymes may be considered.446

Patients with clinical, electrocardiogram or other evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction in the postoperative period following CEA should be treated by
accepted pharmacologic techniques, and urgent cardiac
catheterization should be considered in appropriate
patients.447
The risk of cardiovascular complications after CAS is
very minimal compared with CEA. Data from randomized trials demonstrate signiﬁcantly lower numbers of
periprocedural MIs after stenting.5,7,8 Performing CAS under local anesthesia is associated with signiﬁcantly lower
risk of MI and other cardiac complications.365
The use of a higher contrast load with CAS, as opposed
