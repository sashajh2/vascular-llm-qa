wires that you would like opened to deliver the device into the patient’s aorta. Which
of the following wires would be most useful for this task?
A. 0.018” fexible Terumo wire
B. 0.035” Amplatz wire
C. 0.035” foppy Glidewire
D. 0.014” Pilot wire
Answer
B. 0.035” Amplatz wire
Discussion: Vascular access wires each have a variety of uses determined by their stiffness,
diameter, hydrophilicity, and tip shape. In this case, a stiff wire to pass a large aortic
endograft over would be the most useful. The larger diameter wire will be stiffer, which
rules out options “A” and “D”, which would both be used for getting access to smaller
vessels. Option C is a foppy glide wire which can be useful for crossing lesions and
getting up and over the aortic bifurcation. The 0.035” Amplatz wire is a stiff guidewire
that will not buckle under the pressure of passing a large device into the aorta.

5. A 63-year-old smoker presents to the clinic with left lower extremity claudication and
an ischemic ulcer. He is taken to the operating room for an angiogram via right groin
access. Which of the following steps is INCORRECT when obtaining arterial access?
A. Using anatomic landmarks to confirm cannulation through the inguinal ligament
B. Using ultrasound to ensure cannulation of the common femoral artery
C. Using fuoroscopy to ensure puncture at the level of the femoral head
D. Using the Seldinger technique for first access, making sure not to lose access to the artery
during exchanges or wires and catheters.
Answer
A. Using anatomic landmarks to confirm cannulation through the inguinal
ligament
Discussion: On first access for an angiogram with right groin access, the right common
femoral artery should be accessed. The CFA begins below the level of the inguinal
ligament, making answer A incorrect. One should avoid going through the inguinal
ligament as native fascial planes are disrupted and it can make for challenging upsizing
of devices
