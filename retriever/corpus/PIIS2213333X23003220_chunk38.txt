return from the limb. For this reason, in patients with
symptoms of proximal outﬂow obstruction, like venous
claudication, thigh swelling and pain, or in those with
suprapubic or abdominal wall varicosities, or with
continuous ﬂow and lack of respiratory variations in the
common femoral vein on DUS, investigation of the iliac
veins is warranted. During ablation of the incompetent
superﬁcial veins, collaterals to the suprapubic and
abdominal wall veins should be preserved.
1.5.5. In patients with medial thigh or vulvar varicosities, evaluation of pelvic venous pathology with DUS
or other imaging studies is not indicated if they have
no symptoms of pelvic venous disease.
Rationale. There is an association between pelvic
venous insufﬁciency and medial thigh and vulvar varicosities, and lower extremity varicosities are often more severe in patients with associated pelvic varicose veins.81
Although ovarian vein embolization in patients with
pelvic venous disorders may be helpful for lower extremity varicosities, embolization in patients with varicose vein without chronic pelvic pain has not been
studied. In contrast, direct treatment of pelvic origin
lower extremity, vulvar, or perineal varicose veins without
ovarian vein embolization can be effective and durable.82
Evidence. Nonsaphenous, pelvic origin varicose veins
occur in women in the medial and posterior thigh, vulva,
and inguinal area.83 They are the result of reﬂux from the
internal iliac vein through the inguinal, obturator, perineal and gluteal escape points.42 Vulvar varicosities are
estimated to occur in 22% to 34% of women with varicose veins of the pelvis and in 18% to 22% of pregnant
women.82

Seventy-two symptomatic patients with pelvic source
varicose veins, however, only 7% had chronic pelvic
pain.84 In a systematic review of 13 studies on ovarian
vein embolization in 866 women, technical success was
99.8%; signiﬁcant improvement of pelvic pain was reported
