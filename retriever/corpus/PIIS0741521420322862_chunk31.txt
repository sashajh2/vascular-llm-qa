Blauw et al85 surveyed patients before and after revascularization for CMI using the Euroqol-5D survey tool and
reported that revascularization was associated with an
overall improvement in quality of life with improvement
within the activities and pain/discomfort domains.
There may be a role for noninterventional treatment for
patients with CMI, although this role may be more

theoretical or simply a short-term bridge before revascularization. Small, more frequent meals or complete
cessation of enteral feeding can decrease the metabolic
demand of the gut and alleviate symptoms, and parenteral nutrition can fulﬁll the nutritional requirements.
However, the role for prolonged total parenteral nutrition
is limited given the catheter-related risks and the potential for clinical deterioration with bowel infarction.17,86
Interestingly, Baxter et al87 examined the quality of life
for patients on home parenteral nutrition and found
that it was worse in patients with mesenteric ischemia
than in those with Crohn’s disease. The published experience using parenteral nutrition as short-term bridge to
revascularization for patients with CMI is fairly limited,
although data extrapolated for the use of total parenteral
nutrition for severely malnourished patients before
nonvascular surgical procedures suggests that it decreases major morbidity without reducing the infectious
complications.88-90 Furthermore, it cannot replace revascularization as noted by Rheudasil et al,86 who reported
two patients who developed fatal bowel necrosis while
on parenteral nutrition awaiting open revascularization.
Palliative care and hospice are both reasonable alternatives for patients with CMI who are not candidates for
revascularization owing to their advanced comorbidities
and/or personal preference.
The SMA is the most important of the three mesenteric
vessels given the extent of its distribution to the bowel
and is the primary target for revascularization. The crucial
role of the SMA is indirectly supported by the overall better symptomatic relief noted when the SMA is revascularized, regardless of what other combination of vessels are
treated or whether performed by an open or endovascular approach. Notably
