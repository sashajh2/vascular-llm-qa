enosis and the character of the bifurcation plaque. In addition to information
about the carotid bifurcation, there are clinical scenarios
where the clinician requires information on the status of the
vessels proximal or distal to the cervical carotid artery.
These factors need to be considered when choosing between imaging studies. It is common—but not universal—
to use multiple modalities when evaluating a patient with
suspected cervical carotid stenosis.
In NASCET2,3 and ECST,4 a higher degree of stenosis
in symptomatic patients was associated with a higher stroke
risk. The ACAS5 found no correlation between the severity
of carotid stenosis and the incidence of stroke; however,
there were too few strokes in this study to permit a subgroup analysis of the effect of degree of stenosis on the
ability to benefit from CEA. Angiographic data from the
ECST study61 on contralateral asymptomatic carotid arteries from 2295 patients demonstrated a ⬍2% annual stroke
risk in patients with ⬍70% neurologically asymptomatic

stenosis. Asymptomatic lesions with greater degrees of
stenosis had a greater risk of stroke: 9.8% for patients with
70% to 79% stenosis and 14.4% for those with 80% to 99%
stenosis. These data suggest that the degree of stenosis is a
marker of stroke risk in symptomatic and asymptomatic
lesions. Pathologic studies have demonstrated that more
stenotic carotid plaques are more likely to have ulceration,
intraplaque hemorrhage, and intraluminal thrombus formation, all of which are clearly related to cerebral embolization and stroke.62
Plaque morphology is an important feature in assessing
future risk of neurologic events. Heterogeneous plaques
have been shown to increase the risk of neurologic symptoms (TIA/stroke)63,64 and were also associated with an
incidence of TIA/stroke that was higher than that in homogenous plaques for all grades of stenosis.64 Using DUS
