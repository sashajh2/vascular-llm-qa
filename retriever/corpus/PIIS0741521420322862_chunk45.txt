Endovascular with lower perioperative morbidity and mortality, but
lower patency and higher recurrence, no difference in long-term
survival

Gupta, 2010113

1939 patients

Endovascular with lower perioperative complications but lower
patency and higher recurrence, no difference in mortality

to 2006. They reported that there was a steady increase
in the number of endovascular procedures (vs open)
from 28% (2000) to 75% (2006) and that the endovascular interventions were associated with a lower perioperative mortality (11.0% vs 20.4%; P ¼ .001), mesenteric
complications (6.9% vs 17.1%; P < .0001), and individual
organ system complications (ie, cardiac, pulmonary,
and infections), although a higher percentage were discharged home (55% vs 37%; P < .0001). Erben et al116
examined the outcomes across the country for patients
(n ¼ 15,475) undergoing intervention for CMI using the
National Inpatient Sample from 2000 to 2014. They reported a similar trend in the breakdown of procedures
with 70.6% of the patients undergoing endovascular
treatment. Despite the fact that a higher percentage
(43.3% vs 33.1%; P < .0001) of the patients in the endovascular group had a Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 2
or higher, they had a lower mortality rate (2.4% vs 8.7%;
P < .0001), mean length of stay (6.3 days vs 14.0 days;
P < .0001), and lower cost of hospitalization ($21,686 vs
$42,974; P < .0001) and these differences persisted after
adjustment for clinical and hospital factors. Based on
these ﬁndings, the authors concluded that endovascular
revascularization should be the ﬁrst line of
