, there’s a caveat
regarding a false sense of security. Due to the scattering of radiation during procedures, the
eye can be exposed to radiation at oblique angles (i.e. around the glasses), leading to increased
exposure and limited reduction in dose. (Kirkwood et al. 2020) In such scenarios, the optimal
solution for reducing eye exposure would be a full visor or face shield with lateral eye
shielding. A study by Samara et al. demonstrated that the most substantial dose reduction
was observed in the full visor group.(Samara et al. 2022)
Wearing lead safety glasses during interventions is recommended as it reduces radiation exposure and helps maintain eye health, particularly for individuals at risk of accumulating
significant lifetime radiation exposure.

Imaging Technique
Now that we’ve covered both radiation equipment and safety gear, it’s crucial to underscore the
importance of imaging technique. This concept is critical because it addresses the multifaceted
aspects of minimizing radiation exposure during procedures.
The radiation dose depends on both the intensity of imaging and the duration of fuoroscopic exposure. (Rial and Vañó 2021) During endovascular procedures, the operating
surgeon can control these factors by:
1. Pulse imaging: Instead of continuously scanning the patient, the surgeon can pulsate
images (i.e. shoot several plain x-rays). This approach reduces scatter and lowers overall
exposure. It’s especially effective when high temporal resolution isn’t necessary.
2. Collimator use: The surgeon can use the collimator to narrow the X-ray beam, focusing
solely on the area of interest. This method effectively reduces both dose and scatter.

The image intensifier should be positioned closer to the patient to optimize image quality.
Conversely, the X-ray tube should be placed further away from the area being imaged.
If the X-ray tube is too close, imaging quality can degrade and radiation dose increases. This
strategic arrangement ensures that the image quality remains high while minimizing patient
exposure to radiation.

Another crucial aspect of radiation exposure is a person’s distance from the radiation
source. Radiation exposure decreases as the distance from the source increases. This phenomenon follows an inverse square law (1/d
