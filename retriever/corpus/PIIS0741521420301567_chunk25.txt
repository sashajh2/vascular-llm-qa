1.1

In patients who are thought to have RAA, we recommend CTA as the diagnostic
tool of choice, with 1-mm-thickness sections if available.

B (Moderate)

1.2

In patients who are thought to have RAA and have increased radiation exposure
risks or renal insufﬁciency, we recommend non-contrast-enhanced MRA to
establish the diagnosis (Grade 1C).

Technical remark: Non-contrast-enhanced MRA is best suited to children and
women of childbearing potential or those who have contraindications to CTA
or MRA contrast materials (ie pregnancy, renal insufﬁciency, or gadolinium
contrast material allergy).
1.3

If preoperative planning and recognition of distal renal artery branches cannot be
adequately assessed on conventional cross-sectional imaging (CTA), we
recommend the use of catheter-based angiography.

RAAs occur in approximately 0.1% of the population,
although the absolute incidence is unknown.9 Autopsy
studies are likely to underestimate RAA incidence at
0.01% to 0.09%,10,11 whereas angiographic studies are
likely to overestimate this at 0.73% to 0.97%.12,13 Overall,
RAAs are most commonly identiﬁed on imaging

in the evaluation of RAAs, this technique has not been
compared with other invasive and noninvasive angiographic techniques and is operator dependent.21 MRA
may also be considered in young patients and for routine
surveillance to decrease the risk of radiation-induced
malignant transformation with cumulative exposure.

Whereas three-dimensional CTA is the diagnostic tool
of choice for RAAs, the anatomic association of multiple
renal arteries may limit the surgeon’s ability to plan a
successful endovascular treatment
