Question 5. In patients with combined coronary/carotid disease, what is the optimal sequence for intervention?

CABG, Coronary artery bypass grafting; CAD, coronary artery disease; CAS, carotid artery stenting; CEA, carotid endarterectomy; DM, diabetes mellitus;
HTN, hypertension; MI, myocardial infarction; PAD, peripheral arterial disease; RCT, randomized, controlled trial; RF, renal failure.

Three main therapeutic strategies exist for patients with
carotid artery disease, including medical management,
carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting
(CAS). Medical management is recommended in all
cases (with CEA, CAS, or alone) and includes antiplatelet
medications (aspirin, dipyridamole, ticlopidine, and
clopidogrel), high-potency statins, oral diabetic medication or insulin, hypertensive medications, smoking cessation, and lifestyle modiﬁcations.
Controversies and debates exist on various aspects of
the management of carotid disease, starting with
knowing which patients should be screened for carotid
disease. In terms of treatment, an important question is
under which circumstances to use these treatment
options, particularly as it relates to whether the patient
is symptomatic or not. The issue of optimal timing of carotid intervention after acute stroke is equally important.
In patients with combined coronary and carotid disease,
the optimal sequence for intervention is also unclear.
