-analysis of 32 studies that demonstrated the risk of stroke is nearly doubled in smokers.103
Moreover, early studies have documented that smoking
cessation reduces stroke risk in both men and
women.104,105
From a mechanistic point of view, recent studies have
suggested that smoking-related stroke risk is related at
least in part to the deleterious effect of smoking on plaque biology in the carotid artery. In a population-based
study of 4657 men in Sweden, a greater than 50% internal carotid stenosis was identiﬁed by duplex examination in 5%, 2%, and 1% of current, former, and never
smokers, respectively.106 In a pooled analysis of four
population-based cohort studies (Malmö Diet and Cancer Study, Tromsø Study, Carotid Atherosclerosis Progression Study, and Cardiovascular Health Study) that
included a total of 23,706 participants, there was a significant association between cigarette smoking and a
greater than 50% ICA stenosis (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.8-2.8)
and greater than 70% ICA stenosis (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.14.4).107 More recently, in the Chinese intracranial atherosclerosis study of 2656 patients with acute ischemic
stroke and 208 patients with TIA, current smoking was
associated with extracranial carotid artery disease (OR,
1.47; 95% CI, 1.09-1.99, P < .001). With each additional
year of smoking, the risk of extracranial carotid disease
increased by 1.1% (OR, 1.011; 95% CI, 1.003-1.019; P ¼
.005). Even low levels of smoking increase risk: With
one cigarette smoked per day increment, the risk of
extracranial carotid disease increased by 1.0% (OR,
1.010; 95% CI, 1
