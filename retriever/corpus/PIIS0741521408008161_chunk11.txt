 results from ten
RCTs that included a total of 3182 patients with carotid
stenosis over 50%. The majority of patients were symptomatic and in one of the trials they were designated as being at
high risk for carotid endarterectomy.5 Allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessors were adequate in
6/10 and 2/10 trials, respectively. At 30 days and compared with endarterectomy, carotid angioplasty was associated with nonsignificant reduction in the risk of death (risk
ratio [RR] 0.61 [0.27-1.37]; 95% CI 0.43, 1.66; I2 ⫽ 0 %);
nonsignificant reduction in the risk of non-fatal myocardial
infarction (RR 0.43 [0.17-1.11]; CI 0.16, 0.96; I2 ⫽ 0%);
and nonsignificant increase in the risk of any stroke (RR
1.29 [0.37-2.26]; CI 0.82, 2.31; I2 ⫽ 40%). Considering
that these procedures are performed to prevent stroke, the
statistically nonsignificant increase in strokes associated
with stenting is perhaps clinically significant. In terms of
comparing stenting with medical management, only two
trials are available.21,22 Pooled estimate of odds ratio of the
outcome of death or any stroke was imprecise and associated with high heterogeneity (OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.02-3.23;
I ⫽70%).23 Hence, the evidence for stenting appears to be
derived solely from comparisons with endarterectomy. The
Table summarizes the evidence comparing endarterectomy
and stenting using relative and absolute risk measures.

Values statement
Patients who place high value on avoiding surgical scar
or perioperative morbidity and mortality may opt for stenting, whereas stroke-averse patients may opt for carotid
endarterectomy. Guideline developers placed a relatively
higher value on avoiding the outcome of stroke and a
relatively lower value on statistically significant but perhaps
