95 concluded that
sclerotherapy and phlebectomy may be appropriate in
patients with minor superﬁcial varicose veins not
related to reﬂux of the saphenous system or as a postor adjunctive treatment of varicose tributaries, but data
were limited. A recent Cochrane review in 2021
addressed the efﬁcacy of sclerotherapy alone for
treatment of varicose veins.196 The study included 28
RCTs involving 4278 participants. None of the RCTs
compared sclerotherapy, however, to no intervention or
to pharmacological therapy. There was very low to lowcertainty evidence that FS alone improved cosmetic
appearance, residual varicose veins and symptoms

compared with placebo and possible improved QOL
and VCSS. The study concluded that there is a need for
high-quality trials using standardized sclerosant doses,
with well-deﬁned outcome measures and measurement time points to increase the certainty of the evidence. There have been a number of studies that
showed beneﬁt of treatment of recurrent varicosities
after saphenous ablation using either miniphlebectomy or sclerotherapy, with good results.197,198
Currently, UGFS is most commonly used for treatment
of recurrent varicose veins,198 and re-exploration of the
groin or phlebectomy in that region is avoided. In the
absence of superﬁcial reﬂuxing axial veins or for
