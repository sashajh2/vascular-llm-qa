1. For patients with symptomatic telangiectasias
and reticular veins we recommend sclerotherapy
with liquid or foam.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence B (moderate)
Rationale. Sclerotherapy has been used for decades for
treatment of telangiectasias or spider veins (subdermal
veins <1 mm in size) and reticular veins (veins <3 mm
in size), with good results. FS has been preferred recently
for larger reticular veins.
