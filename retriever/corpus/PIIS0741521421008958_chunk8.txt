Question 1: Medical management vs CEA in asymptomatic patients
We included four RCTs and two observational studies.
Most of the studies had a low risk of bias based on each
corresponding bias assessment tool. One RCT13 had a
moderate risk of bias owing to lack of blinding of outcome
assessors. The studies reported on 5498 patients (mean
age, 70 years; 67% males) with a varying prevalence of
comorbidities (commonly coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia). Patients in all studies
received aggressive medical treatment following up-todate national and international guidelines. Those treatments were focused on antiplatelet therapy, antihypertensive therapy, and lipid-lowering therapy.
Thirty-day outcomes. Medical management was associated with a signiﬁcant decrease in strokes and combined stroke/death at 30 days compared with CEA (3
studies; RR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08-0.87 [Supplementary
Table I, online only], and RR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.11-0.53
[Supplementary Table I, online only], respectively). Certainty in evidence was moderate, reduced owing to
methodologic limitations.
Mortality estimate was highly imprecise to derive conclusions (3 studies; RR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.00-33.71)
(Supplementary Table I, online only). The estimate for
the outcome of MI and ipsilateral stroke was highly
imprecise to derive conclusions. Certainty in evidence
was very low, decreased owing to methodologic limitations and severe imprecision.
Outcomes at longest follow-up. Kolos et al 201512
demonstrated that, at the 3.3-year follow-up, medical
therapy was associated with signiﬁcantly higher risk of
stroke/death (RR, 5.81; 95% CI, 1.38-24.45; Supplementary
Table I, online only). After 5 years of follow-up, medical
therapy was associated with a higher risk
