rior to conventional sclerotherapy. Foam resulted in less
pain and earlier returns to work than surgery.
In a systematic review on foam sclerotherapy, Jia et al10
analyzed data of 69 studies, including 10 RCTs. All patients
underwent foam sclerotherapy for varicose veins, most
frequently with use of polidocanol to ablate the GSV or
SSV. The median rate of complete occlusion of treated
veins was 87%. Meta-analysis for complete occlusion suggested that foam sclerotherapy was less effective than surgery (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.67-1.10) but more effective
than liquid sclerotherapy (RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.91-2.11),
although there was substantial heterogeneity between studies. The authors concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to allow a meaningful comparison of the
effectiveness of this treatment with that of other minimally
invasive therapies or surgery.
