Graduated compression stockings are classiﬁed according to the pressure applied at the level of the ankle: Class
1, low-pressure stockings exert an ankle pressure
<20 mm Hg; Class 2, moderate compression is between
20 and 30 mm Hg; and Class 3 stocking are high
compression stockings with ankle pressures of
>30 mm Hg.89 When comparing against different levels

of compression and lengths of stockings, there was no
clear difference in this Cochrane review.88 Patient preference for one stocking over another was largely driven
by comfort. None of the studies assessed QOL. Overall,
there was insufﬁcient high quality of evidence to determine whether compression stockings are effective as the
primary treatment for symptomatic varicose veins and if
