 revascularization
Early data suggested that TCAR might have a role in the
treatment of patients with symptomatic carotid occlusive disease. Studies have shown that TCAR results in a
similar rate of infarcts using diffusion-weighted imaging
(DWI) on postprocedure magnetic resonance imaging
compared with CEA and that TF-CAS is associated with
a two-to threefold greater rate of DWI.42 Up to 50% of
the infarcts on DWI and strokes that occur after TF-CAS
were contralateral, suggesting arch pathology as the etiology.43 Two recent trials, ROADSTER-1 (safety and efﬁcacy study for reverse ﬂow used during carotid artery
stenting procedure) and ROADSTER-2 (post-approval

cranial nerve injury and shorter hospital stays. The effect
of developing a TCAR program on overall carotid revascularization outcomes was examined by Columbo et al.49
They compared the risk of major adverse cardiovascular
events (MACE), deﬁned as stroke, death, and MI, in centers
that performed only CEA vs the risk of MACE in centers
that performed both CEA and TCAR. At 1 year, the incidence of MACE was 10% lower at the centers that performed both TCAR and CEA vs CEA alone (OR, 0.9; 95%
CI, 0.81-0.99; P ¼ .04).49 Although these studies appear
promising and have been supported by a clinical competency statement from the SVS,50 it is important to
remember that to date the vast majority of TCAR procedures have been performed in patients at high anatomic or
medical risk for CEA and the data
