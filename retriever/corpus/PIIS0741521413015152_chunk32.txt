Examples:
1. Patient Alpha presents with a noninfected, full-thickness, dorsal foot wound with exposed tendon and an ABI of 0.45 with a TP of
38 mm Hg.
Initial WIfI ¼ W2 I2 fI 0
The patient does not respond to simple wound care, so a revascularization is planned.
Simpliﬁed reclassiﬁcation prior to revascularization is:
W2 I2 (a)
2. Patient Beta presents with ABI 0.45, TP 38 mm Hg, and what appears to be a shallow dorsal foot ulcer with induration and >2 cm of
peri-wound cellulitis. Purulence is expressed from the wound and at exploration, an abscess in the tendon sheath requires open drainage,
debridement:
Initial WIfI ¼ W1 I2 fI 2
The cellulitis and purulence resolve after incision, drainage and 3 days of antibiotic therapy, but the wound is now full thickness with
exposed tendon:
Simpliﬁed reclassiﬁcation prior to revascularization is:
W2 I2 (b)
ABI, Ankle-brachial index; CKD, chronic kidney disease; TP, toe pressure.

respect to risk of major limb amputation at one year. The
anticipated beneﬁt of revascularization, however, is high.
Example 2. A 55-year-old man with diabetes, dry
gangrene of two toes and a <2-cm rim of cellulitis at the
base of the toes, but without systemic or metabolic toxicity
has absent pedal pulses. The ABI is 1.5. The TP is 35 mm
Hg. He would be classiﬁed as Wound 2 Ischemia 2 foot
Infection 1 or WIfI 221. The clinical stage would be 4
(high risk of amputation); the anticipated beneﬁt of
revascularization is also high.
Example 3. A 44-year-old woman without a previous
diagnosis of diabetes presents to the emergency room with
systemic sepsis, a fever of 39.5 C, an elevated white blood
cell count of 26,000, and serum blood glucose of 6
