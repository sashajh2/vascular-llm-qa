with the leg rotated outward, heel on the ground, and
weight taken on the opposite limb.5 The supine position
gives both false-positive and false-negative results of
reflux.84
The examination is started below the inguinal ligament, and the veins are examined in 3- to 5-cm intervals.
For a complete examination, all deep veins of the leg are
examined, including the common femoral, femoral, deep
femoral, popliteal, peroneal, soleal, gastrocnemial, anterior,
and posterior tibial veins. The superficial veins are then
evaluated, including the GSV, the SSV, the accessory saphenous veins, and the perforating veins.
The four components that should be included in a
complete duplex scanning examination for CVD are (1)
visibility, (2) compressibility, (3) venous flow, including
measurement of the duration of reflux, and (4) augmentation. Asymmetry in flow velocity, lack of respiratory variations in venous flow, and waveform patterns at rest and
during flow augmentation in the common femoral veins
indicate proximal obstruction. Reflux can be elicited in two
ways: increased intra-abdominal pressure using a Valsalva
maneuver for the common femoral vein or the SFJ, or by
manual compression and release of the limb distal to the
point of examination. The first is more appropriate for
evaluation of reflux in the common femoral vein and at the
SFJ, whereas compression and release is the preferred technique more distally on the limb.84 The advantage of a distal
cuff deflation was emphasized by van Bemmelen et al.85
The cutoff value for abnormally reversed venous flow
(reflux) in the saphenous, tibial, and deep femoral veins has
been 500 ms.81 International consensus documents previously recommended 0.5 seconds as a cutoff value for all
veins to use for lower limb venous incompetence.5,22,86
This value is, however, longer, 1 second, for the femoral
and popliteal veins.81 For the perforating veins, cutoff
