 a duplex-detected Vr >2.5 at the intervention site
predicted subsequent occlusion of the treated arterial segment,
they observed that only one patient with failure would have
received a redo endovascular procedure at the time he had
restenosis, supporting their bias that clinical and hemodynamic
assessments were more useful than DUS for follow-up. Spijkerboer et al264 monitored patients with serial DUS after iliac interventions and found that the clinical outcomes of patients
with residual stenosis did not differ from patients with normal
DUS studies. They also observed regression of some stenoses
over time, without reintervention, an observation that has
been conﬁrmed by others after infrainguinal EVT.265
Bui et al265 analyzed a consecutive series of 94 interventions in 85 patients for SFA-popliteal artery occlusive disease.
Prophylactic interventions were rarely performed, and reinterventions were reserved almost exclusively for clinical indications such as recurrent symptoms or failure of wounds to
heal. Patients were stratiﬁed by whether the initial scan performed in the ﬁrst 30 days after the intervention was normal.

Initial scans were normal in 61 limbs (65%) and remained
normal during follow-up in 62% of these patients. In 17 limbs
(28%), progressive stenoses were detected during DUS. The
rate of spontaneous thrombosis without prophylactic reintervention in this group was only 10%. In this study, DUS was
initially normal after about two-thirds of interventions, a rate
quite similar to that reported for infrainguinal vein grafts.249
However, only 62% of those patients with initially normal
DUS studies remained normal during follow-up, in contrast
to the 90% to 95% rate observed after vein graft placement; a
de novo stenosis rate after EVT is w28%, compared with 5%
after vein grafting.249 The authors also observed stabilization
or resolution of stenosis after EVT occurred quite commonly
despite early abnormal ﬁndings. One important difference
observed compared with FP vein grafts is the poor correlation
between the degree of
