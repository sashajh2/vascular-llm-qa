 provoked by emotional
distress or exposure to the cold.
Palpation
 Palpate the axillary artery in the upper arm in the groove between the biceps and triceps
muscle.
 Palpate the brachial artery in the antecubital fossa just medial to the biceps tendon.
 Palpate the radial artery on the wrist’s fexor surface just medial to the radial styloid.
 Palpate the ulnar artery on the wrist’s fexor surface just medial to the distal ulna; it
lies deeper than the radial artery and may not be palpable.
 Absent pulses should initiate a search for a cause such as proximal atherosclerotic stenosis
in older adults or autoimmune disease such as Takayasu’s in young females.
 Aneurysm of the subclavian artery and axillary artery (assessed above and below the
clavicle) are diﬀcult to palpate if small. Brachial artery aneurysms are usually pseudoaneurysms from trauma or arterial access. Ulnar artery aneurysm occurs from repetitive
trauma in proximity to the hamate bone and manifests as hypothenar hammer syndrome.

Auscultation
 Listen for a bruit in the supraclavicular fossa over the subclavian artery.
 When pulses are not palpable, a doppler is used to assess blood fow in the arteries.
 A blood pressure difference > 10 mmHg refects hemodynamically significant stenosis in
the innominate, subclavian, or axillary arteries. In these situations, the higher blood
pressure is refective of the patient’s actual blood pressure.

Chest and Abdominal Exam:
Inspection
 The aorta usually is typically not visible on the exam. However, a large aneurysm may
be seen pulsating between the xiphoid and umbilicus, especially in thin patients.
Palpation
 The aorta bifurcates at the level of the umbilicus. To palpate the aorta, press your
fingers on both sides of the midline between the umbilicus and the xiphoid. To help
relax the abdomen, ask the patient to bend their knees, fex their hips, and relax their
abdominal muscle. The goal is not only to feel the
