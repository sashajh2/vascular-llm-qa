 when occurring within the Ô¨Årst 2 years
after revascularization or to recurrence of underlying
atherosclerotic disease thereafter. As demonstrated in a
recent meta-analysis of randomized trials, the anticipated, clinically relevant incidence of restenosis 70% or
more is 5.8% after any CEA and 10% after CAS within 4
to 5 years of follow-up.462
Although an increased risk of stroke has been shown in
patients with at least moderate ($50%) stenosis, the
mechanism of the stroke is not clear and may be of cardiac origin or a lacunar stroke.595,598 Without high-quality
evidence, that patients who suffer a stroke or TIA in the
presence of carotid restenosis 50% to 99% should be
considered for CEA or CAS. For asymptomatic stenoses
however, intervention should not be considered before

restenosis exceeds 70%, because the value is uncertain
and the associated risk is high (see Section
COMPLICATIONS OF CAROTID INTERVENTION).
A vast majority of the few patients who develop restenosis will remain asymptomatic. In the meta-analysis
cited above, 1.5% and 5.2% of CEA patients with 0% to
69% and 70% to 99% stenosis, respectively, developed
a late ipsilateral stroke. The corresponding stroke risks
for CAS were 2.2% and 0.8%, suggesting a lower
restenosis-mediated risk compared with CEA.462 Even
with the higher restenosis-mediated risk of CEA, the absolute risk reduction in late ipsilateral stroke is small. The
2% to 3% stroke risk of reintervention (CEA or CAS)460,599
needs to be considered in the cost of any surveillance
protocol, given that the annual risk of ipsilateral (nonprocedure-related) stroke is only about 1% to 2%.600
