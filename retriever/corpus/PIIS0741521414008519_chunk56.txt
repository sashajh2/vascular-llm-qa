 matrix. Another consideration for tissue
biopsy independent of time frame is differentiation of other
possible nonvenous causes for leg ulcer. Although malignancy is rare, for any VLU with atypical features, wound tissue biopsy should also be performed.126-128 Although
wound tissue biopsy provides valuable histologic differentiation, additional tissue analysis to include inﬂammatory cytokines and MMPs is still under investigation and does not
have current clinical applicability.83,129,130

Guideline 3.6: Laboratory Evaluation
We suggest laboratory evaluation for thrombophilia for patients with a history of recurrent venous
thrombosis and chronic recurrent venous leg ulcers.
[GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Several studies have shown that patients with VLUs
have an increased prevalence of thrombophilia.131-133 This
association is increased in patients with documented thrombotic events, family history of thrombotic events, early-onset
VLU before the age of 50 years, and recurrent or recalcitrant
VLUs.134-136 Evidence supports selective laboratory evaluation for thrombophilia in all patients with VLU and a history

of recurrent venous thrombosis and chronic recurrent
VLUs. Laboratory evaluation for thrombophilia should
include testing for inherited hypercoagulable factors (antithrombin deﬁciency, protein C and protein S deﬁciencies),
factor V Leiden (resulting in activated protein C resistance),
prothrombin G20210A, plasminogen activator inhibitor
type 1 mutations, hyperhomocysteinemia, antiphospholipid
antibodies (anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant), and
cryoglobulins and cryoagglutinins.
Guideline 3.7: Arterial Testing
We recommend arterial pulse examination and
measurement of ankle-brachial index on all patients
with venous leg ulcer. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE - B]
Because adequate arterial perfusion is needed for
improved healing, it is important to identify the presence
of underlying peripheral arterial disease (PAD).137,138
