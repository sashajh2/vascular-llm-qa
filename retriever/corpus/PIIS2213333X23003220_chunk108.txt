Outcome

Study design

Park, 2012229

69 patients (C2, C3)
without SFJ reﬂux
but with IPV reﬂux
into GSV

EVLA of IPVs in the
thigh followed by
ablation of the GSV
below the IPV
(n ¼ 34)

Randomized
EVLA of the GSV Technical success was
control trial
starting just
signiﬁcantly lower with
proximal to the
IPV ablation (76.5%)
thigh IPV without
compared with GSV
ablation of the IPV ablation alone (100%)
itself (n ¼ 35)
[P ¼ .002].
No signiﬁcant difference in
closure of treated vein.
No signiﬁcant difference in
occurrence and degree of
complications between
the groups.

Randomized
Reduction in IPVs and

limbs with IPVs with
addition of SEPS.
No signiﬁcant difference in
pain (VAS), mobility,
cosmetic score or QOL
(SF-36, Aberdeen Varicose
Vein Questionnaire)
between groups.

No difference in 6- month
outcome based on
preoperative IPV
presence.

EVLA of venous
varicosities þ

IPV noted in 75% compared
with 98.6% for the
saphenous veins
No signiﬁcant difference in
improvement of VCSS
between groups
Improvement in VAS score
greater after treatment of
isolated saphenous vein
