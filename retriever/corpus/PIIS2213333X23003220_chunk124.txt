 between patients receiving
above-knee-EVLA and those receiving above-knee-HL&S.
Endovenous treatment of below-knee reﬂuxing segments of GSV was investigated in a 2018 retrospective
study of 37 limbs using RFA and EVLA.216 Complete closures were found in 35/37 limbs and VCSS was reduced
in both groups. Ecchymosis scores were signiﬁcantly
lower after RFA vs EVLA with a 980 nm system, but no
difference was reported when compared with a group
where a 1470 nm ﬁber was used. Gifford et al also

reported good outcomes with few complications in a
retrospective series of below-knee-GSV ablation mainly
with EVLA (77 limbs) with only about half of the cohort
including patients with C1 to C3 classiﬁcation and
concomitant ambulatory phlebectomies being performed in 75% of cases.151
Catheter-directed FS has also been investigated as a
treatment modality for recurrent GSV reﬂux in a small prospective analysis of 21 patients in Brazil with mostly C2 disease.216 FS was performed as a pull-back procedure
developed by Parsi with either 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate or polidocanol 3%, using ultrasound guided tumescent anesthesia. Closure rate was 100% up to six months
and 86% at one year. There were no complications.
