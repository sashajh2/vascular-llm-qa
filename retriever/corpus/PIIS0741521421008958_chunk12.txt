 and ipsilateral
postprocedural stroke at 5 years was 8.3% (7.25%-9.6%)
for CEA vs 11.4% (10.1%-12.8%) for CAS (Supplementary
Table I, online only).
Question 3: Timing of intervention in stroke
We included seven observational studies and one RCT.
As for the observational studies, three of them had an
overall low risk of bias and four had a moderate risk of
bias mainly because of inadequate follow-up and inadequate comparability of cohorts baseline prognostic factors. The one RCT had an overall moderate risk of bias
owing to unclear random sequence generation and
lack of blinding of outcome assessors. The studies reported on 9882 patients (mean age, 70 years; 63% males).
Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were the most
common comorbidities.
Outcomes at 30 days. A meta-analysis did not show a
statistically signiﬁcant difference in death and cerebral
hemorrhage at 30 days between CEA performed at less
than 2 days vs 2 to 14 days (3 studies; RR, 1.23; 95% CI,
0.48-3.17; Supplementary Table I, online only) and (2
studies; RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.00-13096.54; Supplementary
Table I, online only). However, the results of the two
larger series suggest worse outcomes with early intervention (<2 days). The study by Tanious et al17 showed
that the risk of cerebral hyperperfusion was numerically
higher in patients who had CEA in less than 2 days vs 2 to
14 days (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.34-7.84; Supplementary Table I,
