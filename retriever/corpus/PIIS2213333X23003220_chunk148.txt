23%; P ¼ .02),
although this difference was due to a higher incidence

of DVT in patients undergoing sclerotherapy
(Table XXII). Although total VTE events were higher
among patients undergoing RFA in comparison with
EVLA (3.1% vs 2.2%; P < .001), EHIT was higher in patients
undergoing EVLA (4.4% vs 3.0%; P < .001). However, a second large metanalysis found the incidence of thrombotic
events to be similar for RFA and EVLA.235
Although some data suggests that the incidence of
thromboembolic complications has decreased since
2009,242 older meta-analyses243 have demonstrated a
similarly low incidence of thromboembolic complication
