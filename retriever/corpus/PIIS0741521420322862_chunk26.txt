3-75 the use of
catheter-based arteriography as a diagnostic test has
decreased signiﬁcantly.76 However, it can be useful
when the other less invasive imaging modalities are nondiagnostic (eg, extensive vessel calciﬁcation, prior stent,
other metallic artifact) or when percutaneous intervention is planned. Optimal biplane imaging includes
anterior-posterior (renal and aortoiliac), lateral (SMA and
celiac arteries), and right anterior oblique views (IMA)
for optimal visualization of speciﬁc vessels. The anteriorposterior projections are helpful to visualize the branches
of the SMA and its collaterals, including the gastroduodenal and marginal arteries, whereas the lateral projection is optimal to view the origins of the CA and SMA
given their posterior-anterior orientation. Selective cannulation can provide additional visualization of the
mesenteric vessels, including their more distal segments
and any collateral channels. Intraluminal pressure measurements can be made across a stenosis at the time
of arteriography if there is a question regarding the hemodynamic signiﬁcance of the lesion.77 It is worth
emphasizing that the other less invasive imaging studies
(ie, DUS examination, CTA, MRA) cannot provide any

functional or hemodynamic data in terms of pressure
gradients. Concerns have been raised about the impact
of the catheter itself and its contribution to the gradient.
These concerns can be overcome by the use of an intraluminal pressure wire, although it is associated with
additional expense. Alternatively, intravascular ultrasound examinations can be used at the time of the
catheter-based arteriography to calculate the degree of
stenosis in the lesion.78,79 Carbon dioxide has been
used as an alternative contrast agent for patients with
chronic renal insufﬁciency, but it may be contraindicated
for evaluation of the mesenteric vessels in patients with
CMI owing to its potential to cause bowel infarction,
particularly in the case of selective injections.80
Implementation considerations
The diagnosis, treatment, and overall management of
patients with CMI is well-known to most vascular care
providers. Indeed, the diagnostic workup has usually
been completed by the primary care provider and/or
gastro
