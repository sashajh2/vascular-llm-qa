Whereas three-dimensional CTA is the diagnostic tool
of choice for RAAs, the anatomic association of multiple
renal arteries may limit the surgeon’s ability to plan a
successful endovascular treatment. In such cases, preoperative three-dimensional rotational catheter-based
angiography may be of great beneﬁt in planning optimal
working angles.22 Furthermore, three-dimensional rotational catheter-based angiography has been shown to
be advantageous compared with two-dimensional catheter-based angiography in 75% of cases in evaluating the
neck, feeding arteries, and relationship between
branches of RAA.23
The ability of CTA to assess microaneurysms of the
distal renal vasculature may also be limited even with
comprehensive renal-speciﬁc CT protocols. This is due
to the rapid background enhancement of the renal parenchyma of the cortex.24 In such cases, CTA may show
parenchymal infarcts or extrarenal hematomas, consistent with distal microaneurysmal disease as seen in cases
of polyarteritis nodosa. However, catheter-based angiography

several series support no incidence of rupture during
the surveillance of nonoperative RAAs out to
270 months.9,14,30,35-39 Most recent estimates suggest a
median annualized growth rate of 0.06 to
0.6 mm.14,39,40 The most recent and largest multiinstitutional retrospective series of nonoperative RAA
surveillance found no difference in growth rate based
on aneurysm morphology or calciﬁcation.14 These authors also reported the successful surveillance of 88 aneurysms measuring 2 to 3 cm and 7 aneurysms
measuring >3 cm without complication or rupture.
The revised 3-cm size threshold for repair is based on
limited literature, however, making this a Grade 2C
