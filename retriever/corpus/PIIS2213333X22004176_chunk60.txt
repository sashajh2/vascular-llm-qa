UGFS, with
physiciancompounded
foam (3%
polidocanol);

At 5 years, all treatment
modalities were
efﬁcacious and
resulted in similar
improvement in VCSS
and QoL; signiﬁcantly
greater incidence of
recanalization of
treated vein and
reoperations after
UGFS with physiciancompounded foam

RCT

Vahaaho et al,8
2015

196 Patients with
varicose veins
(166 in 5-year
follow-up); GSV

EVLA (n ¼ 57);
HL&S
(n ¼ 50)

UGFS with
physiciancompounded
foam (1%
polidocanol;
1% or 3%
sodium
tetradecyl
sulfate; n ¼ 59)

At 5 years, UGFS had
lowest occlusion rate
without additional
intervention (41% vs
89% vs 96%; P < .001);
AVSS scores were
similar

RCT

Brittenden
et al,99 2014;
Brittenden
et al,10 2019

798 Patients with
varicose veins
randomized,
(GSV or SSV), C2C6); at 5 years,
595 patients
studied

EVLA (n ¼ 212);
open surgery
(n ¼ 289)

UGFS with
physiciancompounded
foam (1% or
3% sodium
tetradecyl
sulfate; n ¼
292)

Ablation rates at 6 weeks
and 6 months lower
after UGFS; at 5 years,
disease-speciﬁc QoL
was worse after UGFS;
cost-effectiveness
model iteration
favored EVLA
