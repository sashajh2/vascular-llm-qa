 scanning.
1.2.1. For patients with CVD of the lower extremities, we
recommend duplex ultrasound scanning (DUS) as the
diagnostic test of choice to evaluate for venous reﬂux.

Implementation remarks.
1.3.1. Reﬂux is deﬁned as a minimum value of >500 ms
of reversed ﬂow in the superﬁcial truncal veins (great
saphenous vein [GSV], small saphenous vein [SSV],
anterior accessory GSV [AAGSV], posterior accessory
GSV [PAGSV]) and in the tibial, deep femoral, and perforating veins. A minimum value of >1 second of reversed
ﬂow is diagnostic of reﬂux in the common femoral,
femoral, and popliteal veins. There is no minimum diameter required to have pathologic reﬂux.
1.3.2. Axial reﬂux of the GSV is deﬁned as uninterrupted retrograde venous ﬂow from the groin to the
upper calf. Axial reﬂux in the SSV is deﬁned as being
from the knee to the ankle. Axial reﬂux in the AAGSV
and PAGSV is retrograde ﬂow between two measurements, $5 cm apart. Retrograde ﬂow can occur in
the superﬁcial or deep veins, with or without perforating veins. Junctional reﬂux is limited to the

saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) or saphenopopliteal
junction (SPJ). Segmental reﬂux occurs in only a
portion of a superﬁcial or deep truncal vein.
1.3.3. A deﬁnition of “pathologic” perforating veins in
patients with varicose veins (CEAP clinical class C2 includes those with an outward ﬂow duration of
>500 ms and a diameter of >3.5 mm on DUS.
