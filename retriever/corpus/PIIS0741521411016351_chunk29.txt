 MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS
WITH CAROTID STENOSIS
Optimal medical management is an important part of
overall treatment of all patients with carotid bifurcation
disease, regardless of the degree of stenosis or the plan for
intervention. This therapy is directed both at the reduction
of stroke and overall cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular-related mortality. The best medical management for stroke prevention was highlighted in clinical practice guidelines issued jointly in 2006 by the AHA and the
American Stroke Association, and cosponsored by the
Council on Cardiovascular Radiology and Intervention and
the American Academy of Neurology.100
A. Treatment of hypertension
Elevated blood pressure increases the risk for stroke,101
and reducing blood pressure decreases the risk for
stroke.102 The relationship between blood pressure and
stroke risk is “continuous, consistent, and independent of
other risk factors.”103 The Framingham Heart study,104
the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study,105
and the Cardiovascular Health Study106 each found that
hypertension was independently associated with an elevated risk for carotid artery atherosclerosis. Each 10-mm

Hg increase in blood pressure results in an increase in risk
for stroke of 30% to 45%. Each 10-mm Hg reduction in
blood pressure amongst hypertensive patients decreases the
risk for stroke by 33%.102
Lowering blood pressure to a target ⬍140/90 mm Hg
by lifestyle interventions and antihypertensive treatment is
recommended in individuals who have hypertension with
asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis.100 Aggressive lowering of blood pressure may harm patients who have had a
recent stroke by reducing cerebral perfusion. In fact, the
Joint National Committee for the Prevention, Detection,
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure-VII has
remained ambiguous regarding recommendations for
antihypertensive management in patients with a recent
stroke.103 However, antihypertensive therapy aimed at reducing blood pressures to ⬍140/90 is recommended for
patients who have had an ischemic stroke or TIA and are
beyond the hyper
