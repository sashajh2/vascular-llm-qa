 follow superﬁcial vein ablations, and those
with long-standing and large medial ulcers or recurrent ulcerations have the chance to beneﬁt most. In the North American SEPS registry, factors associated with ulcer healing
included SEPS with concomitant ablation of superﬁcial reﬂux
and lack of deep venous obstruction (P < .05).354,355
Guideline 6.7: Pathologic Perforator Venous
Reﬂux in the Absence of Superﬁcial Venous Disease,
With or Without Deep Venous Reﬂux, and a Healed
or Active Venous Ulcer
In a patient with isolated pathologic perforator veins
(outward ﬂow of >500 ms duration, with a diameter of
>3.5 mm) located beneath or associated with the healed
(C5) or active ulcer (C6) bed regardless of the status of
the deep veins, we suggest ablation of the “pathologic”
perforating veins in addition to standard compression
therapy to aid in venous ulcer healing and to prevent
recurrence. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
There is no RCT that evaluated the effect of isolated
perforator interruption on ulcer healing or recurrence.

Results of the SEPS registry, however, found that ulcer
recurrence in 57 patients who underwent SEPS without
saphenous ablation was not signiﬁcantly higher than recurrence after combined venous surgery.354 Endovenous interventions, as discussed in Guideline 6.8, will undoubtedly
bring new evidence to corroborate the efﬁcacy of perforator
ablations in the treatment of venous ulcers.
Guideline 6.8: Treatment Alternatives for Pathologic Perforator Veins
For those patients who would beneﬁt from pathologic perforator vein ablation, we recommend treatment by percutaneous techniques that include
ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy or endovenous thermal ablation (radiofrequency or laser) over open
venous perforator surgery to eliminate the need for incisions in areas of compromised skin. [GRADE - 1;

and laser ab
