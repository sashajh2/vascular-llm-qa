 5 years. Of the 53 limbs with a normal
venous ﬁlling index after surgery, 29 (55%) had deteriorated at 3 years. The investigators had concluded that
incomplete superﬁcial surgery, in particular at the SFJ
and SPJ, is a less frequent cause of recurrent disease and
that neovascular reconnection and persistent abnormal
venous function are the major contributors to disease
recurrence.
In a retrospective study, Stuart et al206 evaluated 62
limbs of 47 patients (including 47 limbs with C2-C3 disease) treated with SFJ ligation, stripping of the GSV in
the thigh, and multiple phlebectomies vs SPJ ligation
and multiple phlebectomies, or both. The patients were
examined before surgery and at 14 weeks. After intervention, a signiﬁcant reduction was found in the total number of limbs with IPVs (65% preoperatively vs 37%
postoperatively; P < .01). Additionally, a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of IPVs imaged (52% vs 28%; P < .01)
and in the median IPV diameter (median, 4 mm [range,
1-11 mm]; vs median, 3 mm [range, 1-8 mm]; P < .01) had
occurred after surgery. However, IPVs remained in 20% of
the limbs in which axial saphenous reﬂux had been

abolished compared with 72% of the limbs in which superﬁcial or deep reﬂux remained (P < .01). The investigators concluded that superﬁcial venous surgery fails to
correct perforator vein incompetence in patients with
deep vein reﬂux and those with persistent superﬁcial
reﬂux.206
