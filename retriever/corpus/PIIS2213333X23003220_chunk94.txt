 the superﬁcial into the deep

and reduction of the venous pressure reduces the size of
varicose veins a few months after the operation.178
Evidence. Two systematic reviews by BellmuttMontoya et al27,28 studied the CHIVA procedure,
comparing them to HL&S and to endovenous procedures (Table XVII). The last review in 202128 included six
RCTs and 1160 patients, three RCTs compared CHIVA to
HL&S, one to compression treatment of venous ulcers,
one to HL&S and RFA and another to HL&S and EVLA.
Five studies reported recurrence of varicose veins at
18 months to 10 years. The review concluded that CHIVA
may make little or no difference to the recurrence of
varicose veins compared with stripping (RR, 0.74; 95% CI,
0.46-1.20), and it may make little or no difference in
preventing recurrence compared with RFA (RR, 2.02;
95% CI, 0.74-5.53) or to EVLA (RR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.01-4.06).
Side effects were similar, but CHIVA may reduce slightly
nerve injury compared with HL&S and may cause more
bruising than RFA. Evidence supporting all results in this
Cochrane review were of low certainty, based on a small
number of trials with high risk of bias, with imprecise
results due to the small number of events.

A retrospective study by Maeso et al, reported better
clinical results after CHIVA than after HL&S at 3 years.179
In a subsequent prospective study by the same group,
58 patients underwent the CHIVA procedure, with ligation of the GSV tributary that connected to a re-entry
perforator. The ligation eliminated SFJ reﬂux in all but
5 patients (8%). Saphenous reﬂux, however, returned
in 88% of the limbs by 6 months and 46 patients
required a second operation to ligate and divide the
