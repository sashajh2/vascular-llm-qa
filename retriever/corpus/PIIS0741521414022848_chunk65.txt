 attractive alternative to open bypass
surgery for infrainguinal occlusive disease. PTA and stenting are the most commonly used EVTs for focal and
intermediate-length stenosis.9,189 However, the development of other techniques and technologies, such as subintimal angioplasty, devices for crossing and re-entering
long-segment total occlusions, stent grafts, and mechanical

and laser atherectomy, have made it possible to successfully
treat even advanced disease,190 leading some vascular specialists to advocate an endovascular-ﬁrst approach for patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization.191 In
most cases, endovascular procedures are well tolerated
with minimal complications, require short hospital stays,
and result in rapid recovery.
However, endovascular procedures are less durable
than surgical bypass and have a greater need for reintervention, especially in cases of diffuse stenosis or longsegment total occlusion of the superﬁcial femoral or
popliteal arteries, or both (Table IV). Although the frequency with which failed open or EVTs lead directly to
clinical worsening is unclear, it undoubtedly occurs with
either modality. This possibility must be carefully considered during discussions with patients, particularly those
with bilateral disease and more challenging anatomy. In
average-risk claudicant patients with advanced FP occlusive disease (FPOD), surgical bypass provides better durability, a decreased need for reintervention, and is usually
well tolerated, with a low rate of complications. In bypasses crossing the knee joint, good-quality saphenous
vein is the preferred conduit when available. EVT is a
reasonable alternative in settings of favorable anatomy
and in those with inadequate venous conduit.
For patients with IC, the reduced risk of complications,
short recovery time, and rapid return to normal functioning
