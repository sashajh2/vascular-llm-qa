 less
than 60% ICA stenosis and in symptomatic patients
with less than 50% stenosis is generally considered to
be small and does not warrant intervention. ECST and
NASCET demonstrated that CEA did not signiﬁcantly
reduce subsequent neurologic event rates in patients
with symptoms of cerebral ischemia and bifurcation
stenosis of less than 50% diameter reduction and it
was actually associated with increased morbidity
compared with medical management.37,168 Notably,
stenoses of less than 60% diameter reduction were
excluded from the asymptomatic studies,28,169
assuming that asymptomatic patients with stenosis
less than 60% would not beneﬁt from carotid reconstruction. Given ﬁndings of the symptomatic trials, this
exclusion proved to be an appropriate decision. There
have been no studies supporting either CEA or transfemoral CAS for asymptomatic patients with less than
60% ICA stenosis.170
Assessing the risk associated with carotid intervention
There are certain anatomic and physiologic conditions
that can increase risk of speciﬁc carotid revascularization
methodologies regardless of the patient’s symptomatic
status. For instance, high bifurcation or high cervical
lesion above C2 may increase risk of CEA171 and aortic
arch tortuosity can increase risk of transfemoral
CAS.172,173 Accordingly, risk stratiﬁcation can generally
be divided into two categories: Anatomic (including the
lesion) characteristics and patient-speciﬁc or physiologic
characteristics.
Risk stratiﬁcation based on anatomic and lesion
characteristics
Lesion location and vessel tortuosity.
High risk for CEA. CEA provides excellent access to the
cervical carotid artery, but lesions that extend outside
this zone can be difﬁcult to treat surgically. It is generally
understood that lesions at or above the level of the C2
cervical vertebra or at or below the clavicle are generally
more difﬁcult to expose surgically during CEA without
increasing the morbidity associated with the procedure.171 Lesions of the dist
