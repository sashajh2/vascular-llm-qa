 some evidence that high levels of highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol may be protective,
but to a lesser degree.88 In 9247 patients with a mean
age of 61 who received treatment to reduce LDL and
raise HDL levels, an elevated total cholesterol/HDL ratio
was associated with a 22% increased risk of stroke
whereas an elevation in the HDL level was independently
associated with a 14% reduction in stroke risk.89
The beneﬁt of statin medications for stroke risk reduction
is most likely due to their pleiotropic effects, and these effects are being recognized in the periprocedural period for
patients undergoing CEA and CAS. A study from the
Johns Hopkins Hospital was the ﬁrst to investigate the
impact of statins on CEA outcomes. In a series of nearly

1600 patients with either symptomatic or asymptomatic
carotid stenoses undergoing CEA, statin use was associated with a 3-fold reduction in 30-day stroke (P ¼ .019)
and a 5-fold decrease in 30-day mortality (P ¼ .049).90
Other studies conﬁrmed the beneﬁcial impact of statin
use on perioperative CEA outcomes among symptomatic91 and asymptomatic patients.92 Most recently, a
meta-analysis of seven studies and 21,387 patients demonstrated that administration of statin medications before
CEA was associated with lower rates of perioperative
stroke and superior overall survival.93
Less has been reported on the inﬂuence of statins on
CAS outcomes, but available data parallel those for
CEA. In a retrospective review of 53 patients who underwent CAS in a single institution, the 30-day stroke/death/
MI rate was 4% in patients on statins and 15% among
those not on statins at the time of the CAS (odds ratio
[OR], 0.23; 95% CI, 0.005-0.99; P ¼ .049).94 This ﬁnding
was conﬁrmed in a study of 344 consecutive patients
who underwent CAS from 2002 to 201
