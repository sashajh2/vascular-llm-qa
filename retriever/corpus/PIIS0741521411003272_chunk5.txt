-effective, and reliable.
We recommend that the four components of a complete duplex
scanning examination for chronic venous disease should be
visualization, compressibility, venous flow, including measurement
of duration of reflux, and augmentation.
We recommend that reflux to confirm valvular incompetence in the
upright position of the patients be elicited in one of two ways:
either with increased intra-abdominal pressure using a Valsalva
maneuver to assess the common femoral vein and the
saphenofemoral junction, or for the more distal veins, use of
manual or cuff compression and release of the limb distal to the
point of examination.
We recommend a cutoff value of 1 second for abnormally reversed
flow (reflux) in the femoral and popliteal veins and of 500 ms for
the great saphenous vein, the small saphenous vein, the tibial, deep
femoral, and the perforating veins.
We recommend that in patients with chronic venous insufficiency,
duplex scanning of the perforating veins is performed selectively.
We recommend that the definition of “pathologic” perforating
veins includes those with an outward flow of duration of ⱖ500 ms,
with a diameter of ⱖ3.5 mm and a location beneath healed or
open venous ulcers (CEAP class C5-C6).
3. Plethysmography
We suggest that venous plethysmography be used selectively for the
noninvasive evaluation of the venous system in patients with simple
varicose veins (CEAP class C2).
We recommend that venous plethysmography be used for the
noninvasive evaluation of the venous system in patients with
advanced chronic venous disease if duplex scanning does not
provide definitive information on pathophysiology (CEAP class
C3-C6).
