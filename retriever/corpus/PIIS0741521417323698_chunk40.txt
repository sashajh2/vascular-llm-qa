(MET < 4), who are to undergo OSR or EVAR, we suggest
noninvasive stress testing.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

B (Moderate)

We recommend a preoperative resting 12-lead ECG in all
patients undergoing EVAR or OSR within 30 days of
planned treatment.
Level of recommendation

We recommend echocardiography before planned operative
repair in patients with dyspnea of unknown origin or
worsening dyspnea.

Table III. Preoperative cardiac evaluation for the patient undergoing aneurysm repair
1. Is there an active cardiac condition?

Unstable coronary syndrome
Unstable or severe angina
d Recent MI (<1 month)
d Decompensated CHF
d Signiﬁcant arrhythmias
d Severe valvular disease
d

d

Presence cancels or delays aneurysm repair until conditions are treated.
Implement medical management and consider coronary angiography.
2. Does the patient have good functional
capacity without symptoms?

d

MET $4 (Table IV)

Clinical risk factors
Mild angina pectoris
d Prior MI
d Compensated or prior CHF
d Diabetes mellitus
d Renal insufﬁciency
d

May proceed with aneurysm repair. In patients with known cardiovascular
disease or at least one clinical risk factor, beta blockade is appropriate.
3. Is functional capacity poor or unknown?

d

MET <4 (Table IV)

Clinical risk factors
Mild angina pectoris
d Prior MI
d Compensated or prior CHF
d Diabetes mellitus
d Renal insufﬁciency
d

In patients with three or more clinical risk factors, preoperative noninvasive
testing is appropriate if it will change management.
CHF, Congestive heart failure; MET, metabolic equivalent; MI, myocardial infarction.
