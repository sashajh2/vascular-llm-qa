recently reported the collective experience (n ¼ 54)
with open retrograde stenting for both CMI (19%) and
AMI (81%) from the Low Frequency Vascular Disease
Research Consortium. The technical success rate was
excellent (98%) and the patency rates at 2 years (primary,
76% 6 8%; secondary 90% 6 8%) were comparable with
those achieved with percutaneous stenting. The procedure can be facilitated by snaring the wire introduced
retrograde through the SMA from the brachial artery at
the antecubital fossa, thereby increasing the functional
working length and allowing the endovascular devices
to be introduced in the more familiar antegrade fashion.
The atherosclerotic occlusive disease that leads to
MAOD typically affects the origin of the vessels. Accordingly, the more distal extent of the mesenteric vessel
tends to be spared and, thus, is a suitable bypass target.
This choice of distal target can be complicated by the
presence of an occluded stent, prior mesenteric bypasses, or more extensive occlusive disease (ie, extending
beyond the origin). The option in this setting includes
selecting a target that is further distal on the involved
vessel. This can require a limited endarterectomy and a
vein patch to help create a more patulous vessel and better bypass target.
Prosthetic grafts are suitable conduits and, historically,
the longer term patency rates have been equivocal
when compared with autogenous conduits.149,150
They are contraindicated in the setting of AMI and bowel
infarction with contamination. Notably, Davenport et al151
reviewed the patients (n ¼ 156) undergoing aortomesenteric bypass for CMI in the American College of Surgeon’s
National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant Use File during 2005 to 2009. They reported that
patients undergoing bypass with vein were more likely
to require a bowel resection and that there was a higher
