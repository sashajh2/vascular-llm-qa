For those patients who would beneﬁt from an open venous bypass, we suggest the addition of an adjunctive
arteriovenous ﬁstula (4-6 mm in size) as an adjunct to improve inﬂow into autologous or prosthetic crossover bypasses when the inﬂow is judged to be poor to aid in venous leg ulcer healing and to prevent recurrence. [GRADE 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
ANCILLARY MEASURES
Guideline 7.1: Nutrition Assessment and Management
We recommend that nutrition assessment be performed in any patient with a venous leg ulcer who has evidence
of malnutrition and that nutritional supplementation be provided if malnutrition is identiﬁed. [BEST PRACTICE]
Guideline 7.2: Systemic Drug Therapy
For long-standing or large venous leg ulcer, we recommend treatment with either pentoxifylline or micronized puriﬁed ﬂavonoid fraction used in combination with compression therapy. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 7.3: Physiotherapy
We suggest supervised active exercise to improve muscle pump function and to reduce pain and edema in
patients with venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 7.4: Manual Lymphatic Drainage
We suggest against adjunctive lymphatic drainage for healing of the chronic venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 7.5: Balneotherapy
We suggest balneotherapy to improve skin trophic changes and quality of life in patients with advanced venous
disease. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 7.6: Ultraviolet light
We suggest against use of ultraviolet light for the treatment of venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE - C]
PRIMARY PREVENTION
Guideline 8.1: Primary PreventiondClinical CEAP C3-4 Primary Venous Disease
In patients with clinical CEAP C3-4 disease due to primary valvular reﬂux, we recommend compression, 20 to
30 mm Hg, knee or thigh high. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
