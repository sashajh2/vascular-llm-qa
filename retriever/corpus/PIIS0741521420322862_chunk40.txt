Rationale and background
The choice of treatment for patients with CMI should
represent a shared decision-making process between
the patient and vascular care provider that involves a
thorough understanding of the associated risks/beneﬁts
of any intervention and incorporates the individual patient’s goals of care, including quality of life. The important outcome measures include both perioperative and

Detailed justiﬁcation
A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature
was performed as a component of these guidelines to
determine the optimal revascularization strategy (ie,
open vs endovascular) for patients with CMI.12 A total of
100 observational studies (22 comparative, 78 noncomparative) were identiﬁed that encompassed almost
19,000 patients. The perioperative complication rate
was found to be increased in the open group (relative
risk [RR], 2.19; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 1.84-2.60;
Fig 1), although there was no signiﬁcant increase in the
30-day mortality rate (5.5% vs 1.4%; RR, 1.57; 95% CI,
0.84-2.93; Fig 2). Open revascularization was associated
with a lower risk of 3-year recurrence (RR, 0.47; 95% CI,
0.34-0.66; Fig 3), but there was no signiﬁcant difference
in the 3-year survival rate between the groups (RR, 0.96;
95% CI, 0.86-1.07; Fig 4). Based on these observational
studies, it was concluded that the endovascular
approach may offer better early outcomes, although
the effect may not be as durable even though the
long-term survival rates seem to be similar with appropriate reintervention when needed. Unfortunately, the
overall quality of the evidence was deemed to be low.
The ﬁndings from our meta-analysis are largely consistent with several other comparable reviews examining
the optimal revascularization strategy for patients with
CMI (Table II). Saedon et al110 (12 studies and 7365
