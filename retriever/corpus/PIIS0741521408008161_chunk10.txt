a

Allocation concealment was not conducted in four trials, and seven trials did not blind data collectors or outcome assessors.
Imprecision is based on risk difference which has wide confidence interval.

b

ablative neck surgery (eg, radical neck dissection, laryngectomy); (4) common carotid artery stenosis below the clavicle; (5) contralateral vocal cord paralysis; and (6) presence
of a tracheostomy stoma.
The authors could not define “high medical risk” with
equal precision. Dialysis dependent renal failure, extremely
low left ventricular ejection fraction, and oxygen or steroid
dependent chronic lung disease are examples of potentially
useful high medical risk criteria. Data on the influence of
such medical factors on carotid endarterectomy outcomes
are inconsistent and generally of poor quality.
Evidence
Upon the request of the carotid committee of the SVS,
a meta-analysis of randomized trials that compared carotid
angioplasty and carotid endarterectomy was updated to
include recent trials.20 This review pooled results from ten
RCTs that included a total of 3182 patients with carotid
stenosis over 50%. The majority of patients were symptomatic and in one of the trials they were designated as being at
high risk for carotid endarterectomy.5 Allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessors were adequate in
6/10 and 2/10 trials, respectively. At 30 days and compared with endarterectomy,
