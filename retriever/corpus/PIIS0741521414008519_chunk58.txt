 posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries of each leg, which is then normalized to
the higher brachial pressure of either to calculate the ABI for
each leg. ABI is calculated by dividing the systolic ankle pressure by systolic arm pressure. The reproducibility of the ABI
varies, but it is signiﬁcant enough that reporting standards
require a change of 0.15 in an isolated measurement for it
to be considered clinically relevant or >0.10 if it is associated
with a change in clinical status. The typical cutoff point for
diagnosis of PAD is ABI #0.90 at rest, with ABI #0.50 usually corresponding to critical limb ischemia. In patients with
diabetes, renal insufﬁciency, or other diseases that cause
vascular calciﬁcation, tibial vessels at the ankle become
noncompressible, leading to a false elevation of the ankle
pressure and ABI. In these patients, additional noninvasive
diagnostic testing, such as pulse volume recordings or toe
pressure measurement, should be performed to evaluate
for PAD. For ABI #0.90, referral should be made to a

comprehensive lower extremity arterial Doppler study, arterial imaging, and possible revascularization consideration
before VLU compression or operative therapy.141
Guideline 3.8: Microcirculation Assessment
We suggest against routine microcirculation assessment of venous leg ulcers but suggest selective consideration as an adjunctive assessment for monitoring of
advanced wound therapy. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE - C]
Whereas objective microcirculation assessment by
transcutaneous oxygen, laser Doppler perfusion, and capillary microscopy has shown correlation with healing of
other wounds, there is insufﬁcient evidence showing
beneﬁt for VLUs. Microcirculation assessment may be useful as an adjunct for mixed arterial and VLUs, when there is
concern for adequate microcirculation related to other
medical conditions involving capillary perfusion, or for
monitoring of advanced wound therapy.142-144
Guideline 3.9: Venous Duplex Ultrasound
We recommend comprehensive venous duplex ultrasound examination of the lower extremity in all patients with suspected
