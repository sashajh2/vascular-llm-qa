 may help patients suffering
from primary varicose veins.499 An RCT showed that spa
therapy, associated with balneotherapy and patient education, signiﬁcantly and durably improved trophic skin
changes, quality of life, and symptoms in patients with
CVD but did not ﬁnd a difference in VLU
recurrences.497
Guideline 7.6: Ultraviolet light
We suggest against use of ultraviolet light for the
treatment of venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL
OF EVIDENCE - C]
Ultraviolet light has been proposed for the treatment
of VLUs to increase skin blood ﬂow and to reduce hypoxia.
However, the results of one clinical prospective study
showed that ultraviolet irradiation improves skin oxygenation for only 48 hours, and therefore it cannot be recommended until there is further supporting evidence.500
PRIMARY PREVENTION
VLUs develop because of ambulatory venous hypertension, which is related primarily to venous valvular reﬂux.
Meaningful ways to prevent VLUs in patients at risk are
effective but limited by lack of provider knowledge of diagnosis and treatment and patient compliance with the

primary means of prevention, which is compression.
Equally important for prevention of VLUs in patients
with DVT is adherence to evidence-based guidelines
for prevention of DVT recurrence. In this section, current
evidence for therapies related to primary prevention of
VLUs is reviewed.
Guideline 8.1: Primary PreventiondClinical CEAP
C3-4 Primary Venous Disease
In patients with clinical CEAP C3-4 disease due to
primary valvular reﬂux, we recommend compression,
20 to 30 mm Hg, knee or thigh high. [GRADE - 2;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
The concept behind compression is to reduce edema
and inﬂammation related to venous hypertension in the
lower limbs, particularly in the gaiter region, where
VLUs are most likely to develop. Patients may progress
from C2 to C3-C6 at 2% per year.501 Patients with C3-4
disease have a moderate risk of progressing to venous
