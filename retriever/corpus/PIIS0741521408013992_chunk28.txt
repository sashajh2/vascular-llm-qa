CI, Confidence interval; N/A, Not applicable; RR, relative risk.
a
Only three of 83 studies were randomized.
b
In many studies, the two cohorts were not similar at baseline, blinded outcome assessment was not used, and loss to follow-up and funding source were not
reported.
c
Not all of the included studies reported this outcome; thus, outcome may have been collected and not reported.
d
The proportion of heterogeneity that is not attributed to chance is ⬎50%.
e
RR ⬍0.50.
f
The imbalance in the number of the two groups suggests that surgeons in these studies performed many more autogenous access placements than they did of
prosthetic ones, implying possible lack of experience in prosthetic access placement and biased selection of patients.

autogenous access is associated with a lower incidence of
death and access infection and with a higher primary and
secondary patency at 12 and 36 months.14 Subgroup analysis of 13 studies showed a significant access location–
complication interaction, suggesting that the benefit of
autogenous access compared with prosthetic access in
terms of lowering the incidence of the three complications
of steal, aneurysm, and hematoma is significantly more in
the case of lower arm autogenous access compared with
upper arm autogenous access, with RRs of 0.20 (95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.06-0.68) for the lower arm
autogenous subgroup and 1.29 (95% CI, 0.43-3.91) for
the upper arm autogenous subgroup (P ⫽ .03 ). An overall
summary of the evidence derived from this systematic review is presented in Table I. Autogenous hemodialysis
access options can be maximized by using venous transposition procedures (eg, the radial
