Evidence

8.1.1.

For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the GSV or SSV and associated varicosities, we
recommend ablation of the reﬂuxing venous trunk and concomitant phlebectomy or
ultrasound- guided FS of the varicosities with PCF or PEM.

8.1.3

For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the GSV or SSV, we suggest ablation of the reﬂuxing 2 (weak)
venous trunk and staged phlebectomy or UGFS of the varicosities only if anatomical or
medical reasons are present. We suggest shared decision-making with the patient
regarding the timing of the procedure.

8.1.4. For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the AAGSV or PAGSV, we suggest ablation of the
reﬂuxing venous trunk and staged phlebectomy or UGFS of the varicosities only if
anatomical or medical reasons present. We suggest shared decision-making with the
patient regarding the timing of the procedure.

Good clinical practice statement
8.2.

For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the major superﬁcial venous trunks and associated varicosities undergoing initial
ablation alone, we recommend follow-up for >3 months to assess the need for staged phlebectomy or ultrasound- guided
sclerotherapy for persistent or recurrent symptoms. Longer follow-up is recommended for those with recurrence or more
advanced CEAP class.
