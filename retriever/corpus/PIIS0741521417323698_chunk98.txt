incised to the left side of the aorta, avoiding the IMA. The
inferior mesenteric vein may need to be divided to avoid
inadvertent traction injury or avulsion by ﬁxed retractors
used to assist in exposing the infrarenal aortic neck.
The left renal vein may need to be mobilized, and if
suprarenal clamp placement is required, division of the
gonadal, adrenal, and lumborenal branches of the renal
vein will facilitate its mobilization. Should division of
the left renal vein be planned to optimize exposure of
the aortic neck, the gonadal, adrenal, and lumbar
branches should be preserved to provide collateral ﬂow
from the kidney. In the presence of signiﬁcant mural
thrombus at the level of the aortic neck, isolation and
temporary occlusion of the renal arteries may be
warranted to minimize the risk of renal artery embolization at the time of clamp placement.
If the aneurysm extends above the renal arteries or
signiﬁcant aortic calciﬁcation is present, it may be preferable to clamp the supraceliac aorta.411,412 Patients in
whom an aortic aneurysm required a suprarenal clamp
have an increased risk of renal dysfunction and morbidity
but similar 30-day mortality compared with those in
whom an infrarenal clamp site was sufﬁcient for repair
of an AAA.407,408,413 Visceral vessel control is not necessary as backbleeding is minimal after supraceliac aortic
cross-clamp application.
The sequence of clamping should begin with the least
diseased segment to avoid the risk of distal embolization. Typically, the iliac arteries are clamped ﬁrst, followed
by the proximal aorta. Distal clamping is always at the
level of the iliac arteries because aneurysm disease usually extends to the aortic bifurcation, even in patients
with planned reconstruction using a tube graft. If the
common iliac arteries are aneurysmal, the external iliac
arteries need to be dissected and controlled separately.
The internal iliac arteries may require balloon occlusion
