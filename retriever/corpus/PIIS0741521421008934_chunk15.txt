otid stenosis
in 8419 patients. Ipsilateral stroke was also linearly associated with the degree of ipsilateral carotid stenosis (P <
.0001). Patients with 70% to 99% carotid stenosis (386
of 3778 patients) had a greater risk of ipsilateral stroke
than those with 50% to <70% stenosis (181 of 3806 patients; odds ratio [OR] 2.1; P < .0001). They concluded
that the beneﬁt of CEA might have been underestimated for patients with severe stenosis (>70%). In addition, the 5-year stroke risk was relatively low in those
patients with <70% stenosis receiving contemporary
best medical therapy.26
Concerns have also been raised regarding whether the
results of the previously described controlled trials could
be attained in vascular surgical practice outside of clinical
trials. Critics pointed out that these trials had been performed at centers of excellence and that the patients
had been highly selected. However, subsequent reports
of patients who would have been excluded from these trials suggested that the exclusion criteria did not falsely
lower the complication rates. The combined stroke and
death rates after CEA for patients deﬁned as high risk or
eligible for high-risk carotid registries varied from 1.4% to
3.6%, well within the American Heart Association guidelines.27-29 Similarly, studies of large National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, state, and Medicare databases
of 4000 to 35,000 patients demonstrated stroke and
death rates as low as 2.2%, with a maximum of 6.9%
(symptomatic patients only), suggesting that the results
that conform to national guidelines are achievable across
large patient populations.7,30,31 The role of TF-CAS or transcervical carotid artery revascularization (TCAR) is even less
clear because no completed studies have compared
these treatments for patients with asymptomatic carotid
stenosis against best medical therapy.
Several upcoming, multicenter randomized trials have
been designed to answer the role of modern pharmacologic therapy in the management of asymptomatic
carotid stenosis. These trials include
