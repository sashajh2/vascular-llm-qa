the intima. The histologic hallmark of Takayasu aortitis is
multifocal medial laminar necrosis rimmed by macrophages and occasional giant cells. Quiescent or “burnt
out” Takayasu disease is characterized by dense adventitial ﬁbrous thickening and marked medial ﬁbrosis with
loss of the normal lamellar structure.
Giant cell arteritis is a systemic vasculitis characterized
by focal, transmural granulomatous inﬂammation with
giant cells, intimal thickening, and inﬁltrates of mononuclear cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils.34 This manifestation is called granulomatous arteritis. The key
characteristic of granulomatous arteritis is the segmental
spread of inﬂammatory inﬁltrates, made up of T cells and
histiocytes, that results in “skip lesions.” Both Takayasu
aortitis and giant cell arteritis are large-cell vasculitides
that appear to be the target of new medical managements that include the use of targeted biologics.35
PAU, IMH, and AD. PAU and IMH, a complex spectrum
of aortic disease, are unique but often intertwined pathologic processes. This document is not intended to provide a review of AD as it will be reviewed in separate
SVS guidelines.
Brieﬂy, an atherosclerotic plaque can ulcerate and
result in a limited dissection or PAU.36 The ulceration
penetrates the internal elastic lamina, resulting in hematoma formation within the media. The plaque may precipitate a localized intramedial dissection associated
with a variable amount of IMH within the aortic wall,
which can spread into the adventitia, forming a pseudoaneurysm or causing rupture. PAUs are typically not aneurysmal but can occur concurrently with or in the absence
of an aortic aneurysm,
