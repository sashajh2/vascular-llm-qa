.28-0.91; I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies100,105) and
(RR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02-0.98; 1 study105), respectively.
Outcomes at 5 years.
Anatomic closure. EVLA was associated with a higher
rate of anatomic closure than foam UGFS (RR, 2.91; 95%
CI, 1.89-4.49; 1 study102).
Quality of life. Disease-speciﬁc QoL 5 years after treatment was better after EVLA than after UGFS (2.86;
95% CI 4.49 to 1.22; P < .001). Generic QoL measures
were similar.102
Recurrent varicosity scale. EVLA was associated with a
lower recurrent varicosity scale score than UGFS (SMD,
e0.25; 95% CI, e0.43 to e0.07; 1study102).
Reintervention. RFA was associated with a lower risk of
reintervention compared with UGFS (RR, 0.44; 95% CI,
0.27-0.71; 1 study103). No signiﬁcant differences were
found for other outcomes such as DVT, recurrent varicosity, recurrent ulceration, edema, lumps, pigmentation,
or recurrent ulceration. Outcomes are presented in
Supplementary Table VI (online only).
Adverse events.
Minor AEs. EVLA was signiﬁcantly associated with
increased risk of minor AEs than CAC (RR, 3.29; 95% CI,
2.32-4.67; I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies75,76). However, compared
with UGFS, EVLA was associated with a lower risk of
minor AEs (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45-0.93; I2 ¼ 78.6%;
