 femoral, proximal, mid, and distal femoral and popliteal
veins, SFJ, and at least two segments along the GSV and SSV.

1.4.4. We recommend that a complete DUS examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities include measurement of the
spectral Doppler waveform using calipers. Reﬂux at baseline and in response to a Valsalva maneuver or distal augmentation
in the common femoral vein and at the SFJ and in response to distal augmentation in the midfemoral and popliteal vein
should be documented. Reﬂux in the GSV at the proximal thigh and knee, in the AAGSV or PAGSV at the SFJ and at the
proximal thigh and in the SSV at SPJ and at the proximal calf should be documented.
1.4.5.

We recommend that a complete DUS examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities include diameter
measurements in patients with the leg in the dependent position, from the anterior to the posterior wall, in the GSV 1 cm
distal to the SFJ, at the proximal thigh and at the knee, in the AAGSV and PAGSV in the proximal thigh, and in the SSV at the
SPJ and the proximal calf. Images of both normal and abnormal ﬁndings should be documented in the records of the
patient.

Consensus statements
1.5.1.

In asymptomatic patients with telangiectasias or reticular veins (CEAP Class C1) DUS evaluation of the lower extremity veins
should not be routinely performed, since testing could result in unnecessary saphenous vein ablation procedures.

1.5.2.

In symptomatic CEAP Class C1 patients with bleeding or with severe symptoms of pain or burning due to moderate to severe
telangiectasias or reticular veins, DUS evaluation may be performed to exclude associated venous incompetence; however,
saphenous ablation for C1 disease without bleeding is rarely required.

1.5.3.

In symptomatic patients with
