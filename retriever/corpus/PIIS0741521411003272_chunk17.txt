49.1% of men and in 62.1% of women. Also reported were
varicose veins without edema or skin changes in 14.3%
(12.4% men, 15.8% women), edema in 13.4% (11.6% men,
14.9% women), skin changes in 2.9% (3.1% men, 2.7%
women), and healed or active ulceration in 0.6% or 0.1%,
respectively. A French cross-sectional survey found varicose
veins in 23.7% of men and 46.3% of women.60
The National Venous Screening Program, under the
auspices of the AVF, screened 2234 Americans for venous
disease.61 The participantsâ€™ mean age was 60 years, 77%
were women, and 80% were white. The CEAP clinical
classification of C0 to C6 was 29%, 29%, 23%, 10%, 9%,
1.5%, and 0.5%, respectively. Reflux or obstruction was
noted in 37% and 5% of participants, respectively.
Progression of primary varicosity to severe CVI and
venous ulcer is not rare: in the North American subfascial
endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS) registry, more patients with advanced CVI had primary venous disease than
post-thrombotic syndrome (70% vs 30%).62 Bauer63 had

already observed in 1948 that 58% of his patients with
advanced CVD, studied with phlebography, never had a
previous DVT.
Varicose veins and venous ulcers can be a great
financial burden to patients and to society. Varicose veins
and associated complications may lead to chronic pain,
disability, decreased quality of life (QOL), loss of working days, and early retirement. In the United States, the
direct medical cost of CVD has been estimated to
