 70% of whom
were asymptomatic, demonstrated that the results of stenting with cerebral protection devices were not inferior to
those obtained with CEA.94 The primary end point of the
study was the 30-day cumulative incidence of death/
stroke/MI, which was 5.4% for asymptomatic patients who
underwent CAS and 10.2% for CEA (P ⫽ .20).
The critics of this study raised several important issues,
including the criteria used to define high-risk patients for
CEA, the failure to randomize ⬎50% of eligible patients,
the unexpected high incidence of postoperative stroke,
particularly in the asymptomatic patients, and questions

about reporting bias. A number of critics suggested that the
absolute complication rates of both CAS and CEA in this
study could not be used to justify either intervention in
asymptomatic patients.223,224 Murad et al11 found that
asymptomatic patients accounted for a minority of all patients entered in 13 trials of CAS vs CEA and that clear
conclusions on the treatment of asymptomatic patients
were not possible.
CREST9 has been the only recent multicenter randomized trial that entered a significant number of individuals
(1181 patients) with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis.
The published results show that although the risk of stroke
with CAS was greater than for CEA in the asymptomatic
patients, this was not statistically significant. The difference
between CAS and CEA in asymptomatic patients for any
periprocedural stroke was 2.5% vs 1.4%, respectively, and
any periprocedural stroke, death, or postprocedural ipsilateral stroke was 2.5% vs 1.4%, respectively. These results for
CAS and CEA were both within the AHA recommended
guidelines.13 In addition, the primary composite end point
of the study that included any periprocedural stroke, death,
MI, or postprocedural ipsilateral stroke was 3.5% for CAS
and 3.6% for CEA (P ⫽ 0.96). These results are considerably better than any other large study,
