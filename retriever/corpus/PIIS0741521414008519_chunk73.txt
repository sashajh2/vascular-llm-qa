 than did those for which débridement was not
performed. However, débridement frequency per patient
did not statistically correlate to rates of wound closure.
Recommendations to débride nonviable or necrotic tissue from the wound bed are supported by established principles of management of all wounds.223,224 However, the
frequency and method of débridement are not well studied
and have not been well established as related to the incidence of wound closure.225
Guideline 4.3: Anesthesia for Surgical Débridement
We recommend that local anesthesia (topical or local
injection) be administered to minimize discomfort associated with surgical venous leg ulcer débridement. In
selected cases, regional block or general anesthesia may
be required. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
The efﬁcacy of topical anesthesia for débridement of
venous leg ulcers was recently reviewed by the Cochrane
Database.226 They identiﬁed six trials evaluating eutectic
mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) lidocaine-prilocaine
cream compared with control.227,228 Patients treated with
EMLA had signiﬁcantly lower pain scores than those
treated without topical anesthetic, leading to their conclusion that EMLA is an effective option for this purpose. For
more extensive débridement, local inﬁltrative anesthetic,
regional block, or general anesthesia may be required for
adequate periprocedural pain control.
Guideline 4.4: Surgical Débridement
We recommend that surgical débridement be performed for venous leg ulcers with slough, nonviable tissue, or eschar. Serial wound assessment is important in
determining the need for repeated débridement.

Guideline 4.5 Hydrosurgical Débridement
We suggest hydrosurgical débridement as an alternative to standard surgical débridement of venous leg
ulcers. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 4.6: Ultrasonic Débridement
We suggest against ultrasonic débridement over
surgical débridement in the treatment of venous leg ulcers. [GRADE
