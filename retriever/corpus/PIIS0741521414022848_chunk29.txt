 exercise program for IC ﬁrst requires an objective
diagnosis, with vascular laboratory testing conﬁrming
the presence of PAD. Such testing may include measurement of the ABI, exercise treadmill testing or peripheral
arterial duplex scanning, or both. Initiation of risk factor
modiﬁcation for atherosclerotic risk factors is a component of any exercise program. At a minimum, therapy
with aspirin and statin medications should also be considered as pharmacologic adjuncts to any exercise program
for IC (see above). Patients must be screened for sufﬁcient cardiopulmonary reserve to tolerate an exercise
program.103
Barriers to exercise therapy. There are both patientspeciﬁc and system-speciﬁc barriers to participation in exercise programs for IC. The exact magnitude of effect of these
barriers is unknown, but in patients screened for participation in exercise research studies, far less than one-half are
ever enrolled in the study. Perhaps the most important
patient-speciﬁc limitations are compliance with an exercise
program and that many patients with IC have medical
comorbidities (angina, congestive heart failure, chronic
