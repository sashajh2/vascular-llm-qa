SUMMARY
Guideline 1.1: Compression after thermal ablation or stripping of the saphenous veins.
When possible, we suggest compression (elastic stockings or wraps) should be used after surgical or thermal
procedures to eliminate varicose veins. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 1.2: Dose of compression after thermal ablation or stripping of the varicose veins.
If compression dressings are to be used postprocedurally in patients undergoing ablation or surgical procedures on
the saphenous veins, those providing pressures >20 mm Hg together with eccentric pads placed directly over the vein
ablated or operated on provide the greatest reduction in postoperative pain. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 2.1: Duration of compression therapy after thermal ablation or stripping of the saphenous veins.
In the absence of convincing evidence, we recommend best clinical judgment to determine the duration of
compression therapy after treatment. [BEST PRACTICE]
