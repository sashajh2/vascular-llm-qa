 suggest treatment
with EVLA, RFA, or ligation and stripping from the
knee to the upper or midcalf over physiciancompounded UGFS, because of long-term improvement of QOL and reduced recurrence.

Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
4.1.8. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the AAGSV or PAGSV who place a
high priority on the long-term outcomes of treatment
(QOL and recurrence), we suggest treatment of the
reﬂuxing superﬁcial trunk with EVLA, RFA, or HL&S,
with additional phlebectomy, if needed, over
physician-compounded UGFS, because of long-term
improvement of QOL and reduced recurrence.

4.2. Thermal vs nonthermal ablation of superﬁcial

the GSV, we recommend either thermal or nonthermal
ablation from the groin to below the knee, depending
on the available expertise of the treating physician and
the preference of the patient.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)
4.2.2. For patients with symptomatic axial reﬂux of
the SSV, we recommend either thermal or nonthermal
ablation from the knee to the upper or midcalf,
depending on the available expertise of the treating
physician and the preference of the patient.
