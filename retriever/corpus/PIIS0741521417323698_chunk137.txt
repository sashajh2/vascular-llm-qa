aortic seal zone as well as the distance between the renal
arteries and the ﬂow divider of the original endograft.
Options include conversion to an aorto-unilateral iliac
bypass with crossover femoral-femoral bypass and iliac
occlusion or placement of an aortic extension cuff. However, the former approach has a lower risk of recurrent
endoleak and rupture because treatment with an aortic
cuff is often associated with continued risk of device
migration.680 Alternatives include proximal extension
with a branched or fenestrated endograft.375 Fenestrated
EVAR for EVAR failure is technically complex because
the existing endograft may interfere with rotational
torque and visualization of the radiopaque markers.
Limb occlusion. Nearly 25% of all arterial reinterventions after open repair are due to limb occlusion, and
they are most common in patients with associated
occlusive disease.681 Limb occlusion appears to be
greater in women and in grafts extending to the femoral
artery. Isolated limb occlusion usually is manifested with
claudication, but occlusion of the entire graft may be
manifested with severe ischemia. On occasion, a patient
may present before complete occlusion of the graft.
Endografts are at a higher risk for limb thrombosis than
bifurcated surgical grafts, as observed in the EVAR 1
trial.682 Endograft limbs can be narrowed by a calciﬁed
small aortic bifurcation or by tortuous, angulated, and
diseased iliac arteries. Although device dependent, the
incidence of limb occlusion after EVAR is approximately
4%, with the majority of occlusions presenting within 2
months and nearly all within the ﬁrst year after
EVAR.394,683,684 Nonsupported limbs are at especially
high risk of limb occlusion.685 However, stented limbs
may also occlude by fabric infolding and kinking between stents.683,686 Whereas the causes of endograft
limb occlusion may be related to a number of factors,
one of the most common reasons is compromised
outﬂow. Occlusion of the internal iliac artery
