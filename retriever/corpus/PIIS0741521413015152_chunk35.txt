Clinical stage 5 would signify an unsalvageable foot (most often because of
wound extent or severity of infection).

of patients by clinical stage should yield a better platform for testing the impact of new therapies in
randomized trials.73 For example, trials targeting reduction
in amputation within 1 year as a primary end point of
a revascularization strategy might be focused on the
subjects who overlap clinical class 4 and moderate/high
anticipated beneﬁt for revascularization.
The WIfI classiﬁcation system is not meant to function
as a stand-alone clinical decision-making tool. Patient risk
factors and comorbidities also play a major part in selecting
the best therapy. Existing proposed comorbidity indices
based on the Prevent III trial,27 the FinnVasc registry,63
the Eurodiale study,54,55 the BASIL trial,24-26 the Greenville LEGS score,62 and other sources need to be carefully
analyzed and resynthesized to create a comorbidity index
that could be used to guide appropriate therapy. Such
a comorbidity index could also be validated by utilizing
the strengths of the SVS Vascular Quality Initiative.72
Additionally, as we move forward, the need for a new
and simpler anatomic classiﬁcation system that correlates
with outcomes after open bypass or endovascular therapy
will become increasingly clear. The scheme would need

to correlate with outcomes and not practice patterns. We
envision that clinical decision making and outcomes
comparisons between alternative treatments would be facilitated by deﬁning subgroups of patients across three
distinct coordinatesdlimb severity (SVS WIfI), patient
risk (comorbidity index), and anatomic severity. Such
a properly stratiﬁed, three-dimensional matrix would lead
to improved clinical
