with ﬁrst 48 hours after a stroke, was protective for postoperative complication (P ¼ .028) and postoperative
stroke/death (P ¼ .003). No signiﬁcant differences were
noted for CAS outcomes when performed less than 2 days
vs between 2 and 14 days. Other outcomes and outcomes
related to other time points are available in
Supplementary Table I, (online only). Certainty in evidence
was very low in all these outcomes, decreased owing to
methodologic limitations and severe imprecision.
Question 4: Screening high-risk patients
We included 47 observational studies, most of which
were single-arm noncomparative studies. Thus, they
were evaluated on the following domains: representativeness of study population, ascertainment of exposure,
length of follow-up and adequacy of follow-up. Nine
studies had an overall low risk of bias, 10 had a high
risk, and 28 had a moderate risk of bias. The studies

reported on 32,641 patients (mean age, 65 years; 71%
males). Patients had hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral artery disease, coronary artery
disease, and diabetes.
The yield of screening for carotid stenosis (deﬁned as
the presence of >50% stenosis) stratiﬁed by various
risk factors is depicted in Fig 3. The highest yield was
for a combination of diabetes, coronary artery disease,
and renal failure (47%; 95% CI, 29%-65%), followed by
coronary artery disease and renal failure (43%). Having
a single risk factor such as isolated hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or diabetes was associated with low yield
(2%, 2%, and 3%, respectively), whereas peripheral artery disease alone was associated with a yield of 18%.
The certainty in the yield of screening outcome is likely
to be moderate or high.
Comparative studies did not show a statistically signiﬁcant difference between the screened and unscreened
populations in terms of death or stroke (2 studies; RR,
0.38; 95% CI, 0.00-1432.82; Supplementary Table I
