 into autologous or prosthetic crossover
bypasses when the inﬂow is judged to be poor to aid in
venous leg ulcer healing and to prevent recurrence.

An adjunctive arteriovenous ﬁstula has been used to
enhance patency after venous procedures. An arteriovenous ﬁstula can produce distal venous hypertension if
the ﬁstulas are too large. Because this pressure difference
will negate the purpose of a venous bypass performed
for relief of venous hypertension, use of an arteriovenous ﬁstula should be temporary and its size should
be controlled to avoid excessive ﬂow. A suitably sized
prosthetic sleeve around the ﬁstula is one method to
achieve this effect and allows later percutaneous closure
with coil.437-440
ANCILLARY MEASURES
In addition to speciﬁc treatments for VLU, such as
wound care, compression therapy, and operative/endovascular interventions described in prior guidelines, some
ancillary complementary measures have been used to
improve ulcer healing.441-449 This section reviews nutrition, systemic drug therapy, physiotherapy, lymphatic massage, and balneotherapy options.
Guideline 7.1: Nutrition Assessment and
Management
We recommend that nutrition assessment be performed in any patient with a venous leg ulcer who
has evidence of malnutrition and that nutritional supplementation be provided if malnutrition is identiﬁed.
[BEST PRACTICE]
Nutrition must be adequate to provide sufﬁcient protein to support the growth of granulation tissue. Although
most VLU patients are ambulatory and not as nutritionally
depleted as patients who require frequent or chronic hospitalization, nutritional support is required if an individual is
undernourished.450,451 Deﬁciency in vitamins A and E,
carotene, proteins, and zinc was found in patients with
VLUs.452 In addition, elderly individuals susceptible to
development of ulcers may have insufﬁcient intake of proteins, vitamins, and minerals.453-455 These patients demonstrate improved ulcer healing rates when these deﬁciencies
are corrected. However, no beneﬁcial effect was
