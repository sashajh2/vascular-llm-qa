, sulodexide (puriﬁed glycosaminoglycan), was encouraging and showed improved VLU healing in 235 patients treated for 3 months.461 Platelet
inhibitors have also been studied in RCTs of VLUs, but
aspirin and ifetroban (oral thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist) have failed to show beneﬁcial effect on healing.462,463
Prostaglandin E1 is known for properties that reduce white
cell activation and platelet aggregation and increase vasodilation. An intravenous treatment with prostaglandin E1 was
tested in VLUs and demonstrated reduced time to healing,
improved complete healing rate, and improvement in other
outcomes pertinent to chronic venous disorders, such as
edema and venous symptoms.464-466 The constraint of
intravenous infusion (3 hours daily for 6 weeks), however,
makes this therapy difﬁcult to recommend. The discovery
of the involvement of leukocytes in the pathophysiologic
mechanism of VLUs has opened another pathway for successful investigations.467
Two systemic drugs interacting with leukocyte activation have demonstrated an effect on VLU healing, micronized puriﬁed ﬂavonoid fraction (MPFF or Daﬂon)14,468-476
and pentoxifylline.286,474,477-483 MPFF protects the microcirculation from the damage induced by venous ambulatory
hypertension. Clinical outcome measures in ﬁve RCTs of
VLUs and a meta-analysis (723 patients involved) showed
that adjunctive to compression therapy and local wound
care, MPFF increased the healing rate (at 6 months, relative
risk reduction was 32%; 95% CI, 3%-70%) and shortened
time to ulcer healing,29-31 with a favorable cost-effectiveness31,32 and improved venous symptoms.28,29 MPFF is
used worldwide but is not FDA approved in the United
States. Pentoxifylline was initially developed to treat PAD
and has been used off label in VLUs. It has a powerful
inhibitory effect on cytokine-mediated neutrophil activation,
