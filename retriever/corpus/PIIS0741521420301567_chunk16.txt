, and colic artery aneurysm. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B
(Moderate).
3.3: We suggest medical treatment of nonruptured,
asymptomatic ileal, jejunal, and colic artery aneurysms
associated with polyarteritis nodosa. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B
(Moderate).
4.1: We suggest abdominal axial imaging to screen for
concomitant abdominal aneurysms. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B
(Moderate).
4.2: We suggest one-time screening CTA (or MRA) of the
head, neck, and chest for those patients with segmental
arterial mediolysis. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2
(Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
5.1: We suggest interval surveillance (ie, every 1224 months) with axial imaging (ie, CTA or MRA) for cases
of segmental medial arteriolysis in light of reported cases
of rapid arterial transformation and to monitor regression
in cases of polyarteritis nodosa. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
5.2: We suggest postembolization surveillance every 1 to
2 years with axial imaging to assess for vascular remodeling and evidence of aneurysm reperfusion. Level of
Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).

Pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm (PDAA) and
gastroduodenal artery aneurysm (GDAA). 1.1: In patients
who are thought to have GDAA and PDAA, we recommend computed tomography angiography (CTA) as the
diagnostic tool of choice. Level of Recommendation:
Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
1.2: In patients in whom celiac stenosis is suspected, we
suggest further workup with duplex ultrasound to elucidate whether the stenosis is hemodynamically signiÔ¨Åcant. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak),
Quality of Evidence:
