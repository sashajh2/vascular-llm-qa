ography have been reserved for the investigation of the anatomy and function of the deep venous
system.52-54 Based on evidence of the systematic review
and additional data from the literature, including the recommendations of the 2020 appropriate use criteria of
multiple vascular societies,16 the panel strongly supports
DU scanning as the current reference standard for the
evaluation of reﬂux in patients with CVD.
Implementation remarks for guideline 1.1
1.1.a. Reﬂux is deﬁned as a minimum value >500 ms
of reversed ﬂow in the superﬁcial truncal veins (GSV,
SSV, anterior accessory GSV [AAGSV], posterior accessory GSV [PAGSV]) and the tibial, deep femoral, and
perforating veins. A minimum value >1 second of

reversed ﬂow is diagnostic of reﬂux in the common
femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins.
Van Bemmelen et al55 studied the duration of reﬂux
in the femoral, popliteal, and tibial veins in 32 healthy
patients in the supine and upright position using a Valsalva maneuver, proximal limb compression, and
release of distal limb compression. The distal cuff
deﬂation method was the most accurate and reproducible method to measure the duration of reﬂux.
The reﬂux times for the standing patients
were <500 ms for 95% of the patients.55 The data reported by Labropoulos et al,56 obtained using DU evaluation of 80 limbs of 40 healthy normal volunteers and
60 limbs of 45 patients with CVD, showed that a minimum value for abnormally reversed venous ﬂow
(reﬂux) in the GSV and SSV and tibial and deep
femoral veins of >500 ms should be adopted as standard for the degree of reﬂux. A similar 500-ms value
was also proposed and accepted as the minimum
value for patients with incompetence of other superﬁcial truncal veins, including the AAGSV.57 A minimum
value for signiﬁcant reﬂux in the femoral and popliteal
veins of 1 second has also been de
