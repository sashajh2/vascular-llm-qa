In a subsequent prospective study by the same group,
58 patients underwent the CHIVA procedure, with ligation of the GSV tributary that connected to a re-entry
perforator. The ligation eliminated SFJ reﬂux in all but
5 patients (8%). Saphenous reﬂux, however, returned
in 88% of the limbs by 6 months and 46 patients
required a second operation to ligate and divide the
proximal GSV. Elimination of the reﬂux in the GSV after
the interruption of the insufﬁcient collaterals was
temporary.181
A recent RCT by Gonzalez Canas et al180 analyzed results of RFA, HL& S and CHIVA in 214 limbs. Clinical recurrence rates at 24 months were 4.3%, 7.2%, and 14.7% for
HL&S, RFA and CHIVA, respectively. Ultrasound recurrences were 7.1% for HL&S, 13% for RFA, and 46.7% for
CHIVA. With an 80% power to assess noninferiority, the
study found RFA to be noninferior to CHIVA in terms of
clinical recurrence. Considering the steep learning curve
of the drained and nondrained strategies, the different
types of venous-venous shunts, the need for staged procedures175,182-184 and that all patients require an individualized strategy, it is clear that CHIVA should only be
performed by well qualiﬁed surgeons who are dedicated
experts in venous hemodynamics and DUS.185
7. Treatment of venous tributaries
7.1. Telangiectasias (spider veins) and reticular veins.
7.1.1. For patients with symptomatic telangiectasias
and reticular veins we recommend sclerotherapy
with liquid or foam.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence B (moderate)
Rationale. Sclerotherapy has been used for decades for
treatment of telangiectasias or spider veins (subdermal
veins <1 mm in size) and reticular veins (veins <3 mm
in size),
