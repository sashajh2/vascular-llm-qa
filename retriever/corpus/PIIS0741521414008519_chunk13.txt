 (C6) and incompetent superﬁcial veins that have axial reﬂux directed to the
bed of the ulcer, we suggest ablation of the incompetent veins in addition to standard compressive therapy to
improve ulcer healing. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 6.2: Superﬁcial Venous Reﬂux and Active Venous Leg UlcerdPrevent Recurrence
In a patient with a venous leg ulcer (C6) and incompetent superﬁcial veins that have axial reﬂux directed to the
bed of the ulcer, we recommend ablation of the incompetent veins in addition to standard compressive therapy to
prevent recurrence. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 6.3: Superﬁcial Venous Reﬂux and Healed Venous Leg Ulcer
In a patient with a healed venous leg ulcer (C5) and incompetent superﬁcial veins that have axial reﬂux directed
to the bed of the ulcer, we recommend ablation of the incompetent veins in addition to standard compressive therapy to prevent recurrence. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 6.4: Superﬁcial Venous Reﬂux With Skin Changes at Risk for Venous Leg Ulcer (C4b)
In a patient with skin changes at risk for venous leg ulcer (C4b) and incompetent superﬁcial veins that have axial
reﬂux directed to the bed of the affected skin, we suggest ablation of the incompetent superﬁcial veins in addition to
standard compressive therapy to prevent ulceration. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 6.5: Combined Superﬁcial and Perforator Venous Reﬂux With or Without Deep Venous Reﬂux and
Active Venous Leg Ulcer
In a patient with a venous leg ulcer (C6) and incompetent superﬁcial veins that have reﬂux to the ulcer bed in
addition to pathologic perforating veins (outward ﬂow of >500 ms duration, with a diameter of >3.5 mm) located
beneath or associated with the ulcer bed, we suggest ablation of both the incompetent superﬁcial veins and
perforator veins in addition to standard compressive therapy to aid in ulcer
