disease amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention
should be treated in that manner, followed by treatment of
the carotid stenosis. The presence of carotid disease has
been associated with an increase in the incidence of CVA in
the perioperative period for cardiac surgery. The presence
of a bruit increases the risk of CVA to 1.6% to 5.5%, and the
presence of a carotid stenosis between 50% to 99% increases
the risk to 2.0% to 8.4%.38,46,267 Consequently, the management of concomitant carotid and coronary disease has
been the subject of considerable study.
For patients experiencing symptoms related to a carotid
stenosis (TIA, CVA), the risk of CVA associated with
cardiac surgery is increased to such a degree that concomitant management of the carotid disease is mandatory. Prior
CVA or TIA increases the risk of perioperative stroke to
2.2% to 8.5%. If bilateral 50% to 99% stenoses are present,
the risk of perioperative CVA increases to 5.2% (95% CI,
0%-10.8%). If carotid occlusion is present, the risk of perioperative CVA increases to 7% to 12% (95% CI, 2.1%21.2%).268-271 Alternative treatments, including combined
CEA and CABG, staged CEA and CABG, or CAS and
CABG have all been reported.
A review of the literature to date suggests that CEA,
followed by CABG, is associated with the lowest stroke
rate, whereas combined CEA and CABG carries a higher
mortality rate, and delayed CEA is associated with the
lowest mortality but the highest stroke rate. Most
