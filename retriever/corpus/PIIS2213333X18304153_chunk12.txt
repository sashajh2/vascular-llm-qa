included postoperative pain at the end of 7 days, edema,
complications (hematoma, bleeding through the dressings, skin irritation, phlebitis, and deep venous thrombosis [DVT]), and quality of life. Pain was assessed in all
ﬁve studies, various combinations of complications in
three,13,25,28 and quality of life in one.28
The most consistent ﬁnding from these studies was
that patients treated with higher levels of compression
reported much less pain at 7 days compared with those
treated with lower levels of compression. This was
observed in four of the ﬁve studies.12,13,25,28 In one
single-center study,25 88 patients undergoing a variety
of stripping procedures were randomized to low
(18-21 mm Hg) vs moderate (23-32 mm Hg) compression
therapy, applied daily (8 hours/d) for 6 weeks. Follow-up
was obtained at 1 week and 6 weeks. This included a
questionnaire (nonstandard), clinical examination, ultrasound assessment of edema, and duplex ultrasound
evaluation for phlebitis. At 1 week, there was less pain,
tightness, discomfort, and edema in the moderate
compression group compared with the low compression
group. At 6 weeks, there were no longer any differences
in tightness, discomfort, or edema, although a reduction
in pain was still present. The authors concluded that
more compression was better than less, particularly
during the early (1-week) postoperative period.
Two studies evaluated the beneﬁts of stockings
together with thigh pads placed “eccentrically” over the
site of the saphenous vein in patients undergoing
ligation and stripping.13,28 In a case-control study
performed in three European centers, 36 patients were
treated with two compression stockings with a thigh
pad and 17 with two stockings alone. By postoperative
day 3, there was signiﬁcantly reduced pain measured
by a visual analogue scale (VAS) in the group receiving
both the stockings and the pad compared with the
group
