 not palpable.
Auscultation:
 Auscultate the carotid arteries for bruits.

 Using the stethoscope bell, you can hear the S1, and S2 heart sounds in the carotid artery
in the mid-neck. A bruit heard in the neck is not normal. This could be transmitted
from the heart or could be from a kink or narrowing in the carotid artery. The carotid
bruit is loudest in the mid neck over the carotid bifurcation. A heart murmur is loudest
in the upper chest.
 The intensity of the bruit and pitch do not correlate with the severity of stenosis. A
tight stenosis may have low fow and thus a faint bruit.
 When a carotid bruit is heard, only 25% will have significant stenosis (75% or greater),
and 50% will not have any stenosis.

Upper Extremity Exam:
Inspection
 Pink fingertips with capillary refill times < 2 seconds are a reliable sign of adequate
perfusion. Ischemia in the extremities manifests as paleness with poor to no capillary
refill. Chronic ischemia manifests with muscle atrophy.
 Raynaud phenomenon is characterized by a sharply demarcated triphasic color change after exposure to cold or emotional stress. First, the capillaries contract after the stressor,
causing a characteristic white appearance. Then, as the capillaries open a little, deoxygenated blood re-perfuses sluggishly which leads to a hypoxic blue color of the distal
extremity. Finally, when the capillaries recover and hyper-dilate, the affected limb becomes red and hyperemic. Raynaud’s phenomena may occur idiopathically (Raynaud’s
Disease) or secondarily due to autoimmune disease. It is often provoked by emotional
distress or exposure to the cold.
Palpation
 Palpate the axillary artery in the upper arm in the groove between the biceps and triceps
muscle.
 Palpate the brachial artery in the antecubital fossa just medial to the biceps tendon.
 Palpate the radial artery on the wrist’s fexor surface just medial to the radial styloid.
 Palpate the ulnar artery on the wrist’s fex
