 of AKI in hospitalized patients. Although it
is plagued with inconsistent deﬁnitions in the literature,
its incidence varies between 5% and 25%. Factors consistently shown to increase risk for contrast-induced nephropathy include age, diabetes, previous renal disease,
and escalating doses of contrast material.159-161
Strategies reported to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy are also marred by inconsistent reporting
standards and patient risk factors.160,161 These include
use of IVUS, minimizing the amount of contrast material
used during the operation, prehydration with normal saline (effectively increasing the volume of distribution of
intravascular contrast material), and use of nonionic,
iso-osmolar contrast agents.162,163 Research on pretreatment with statins is evolving.164
Recommendation 22: We recommend preprocedural
TEVAR planning to include sizing and landing sites
before the case to minimize procedural contrast material
use. If available, intraoperative CTA overlay technology
and IVUS should be used to minimize use of contrast
material. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 23: We recommend nonionic, hypoosmolar contrast material with attempts at minimizing
intra-arterial contrast agent use, especially in patients at
high risk for contrast-induced nephropathy. Level of
recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 24: Depending on the patient’s
corporal density and the capacity of the X-ray equipment
available, we suggest diluting contrast material in the power injector when possible (typically to 50% or 70%). Adjustments in injection volume and time (faster injection
of smaller doses) can usually compensate when additional visibility is required. Level of recommendation:
Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low)
Recommendation 25: We suggest the use of on-table
mapping software options on ﬁxed-imaging X-ray systems, such as roadmapping and CT fusion or overlay
