may increase DVT recanalization.531 Second, early use of
compression is recommended, generally within 24 hours
of diagnosis (Grade 2C). Third, early ambulation and
limiting of bed rest are recommended.532 Fourth,

transition from a parenteral agent to vitamin K antagonist
with at least 3-month treatment is the minimum duration.
In certain cases, consideration of the new oral anticoagulants, such as factor IIa or Xa oral inhibitors, may be indicated if the patient is intolerant of warfarin, although the
evidence for these agents is less well documented.533
Last, a recent RCT suggests that low-dose aspirin may
decrease recurrent DVT in those treated initially with 6
to 12 months of parenteral anticoagulation.534
Recent data, primarily from one study, suggest that
low-molecular-weight heparin for 3 months may be more
effective than a vitamin K antagonist for preventing PTS,
with signiﬁcantly fewer ulcers observed during 1 year of
follow-up.535 A systemic review also suggested that lowmolecular-weight heparin may decrease VLUs at 3 months
by w87%.536 More evidence is needed to conﬁrm these results, and whether the new oral anticoagulants offer antiﬁbrotic beneﬁts remains unproven.
Long-term therapeutic anticoagulation is associated
with lower DVT recurrence rates and, depending on the
clinical circumstances of recurrence risk vs bleeding risk,
should direct the duration of therapy.522 An adjunctive
measure to determine duration of anticoagulation is the
measurement of D-dimer 1 month after cessation of anticoagulation. An RCT showed that if a patient’s D-dimer
level remains elevated, venous thromboembolism recurrence risk is signiﬁcantly elevated (w2.5-fold), and continuation or reinstitution of anticoagulation is recommended,
usually for life.537 If the D-dimer level is normal, cessation
of anticoagulation is usually safe. Second, use of duplex ultrasonography for detection of residual vein wall thickening
or obstruction (scar tissue, or “res
