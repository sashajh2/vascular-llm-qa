dence interval [CI], 1.53-4.16).19 In a combined study
population of patients from the United Kingdom and the
United States, patients who were treated for VLUs by a
treatment protocol had a 2 times and a 6.5 times greater
likelihood of ulcer healing if the guidelines were followed
(P < .01). Moreover, the median costs were reduced with
adherence to VLU guidelines (P < .01).20 Finally, in a longitudinal cross-sectional Swedish study of patients in Skaraborg County (population 254,111), the epidemiology of leg
ulcers and of VLUs in particular was deﬁned in 1988 before
the implementation of a VLU treatment protocol. 21 The
initial point prevalence (proportion with an ulcer at any point
of time, time period usually shorter than 3 months) for open
VLUs was 0.16% and overall (C5 and C6) was 0.5%. Their
protocol for VLU management emphasized early Doppleraided diagnosis, organized care pathways, and especially
surgery for superﬁcial venous incompetence. The effectiveness of the VLU guidelines was judged by the reduction in
the point prevalence of VLUs from 1990 to 2005. The
institution of guidelines and concomitant implementation of
county-wide care plans, based on these guidelines, resulted in
a relative risk for VLU of 46%.22
Objective of SVS and AVF Clinical Practice
Guidelines for Venous Leg Ulcer Management. In
2011, SVS and AVF produced clinical practice guidelines
for the care of patients with varicose veins and associated
venous disease.23 Although there were some elements of
VLU care within this document, most of the emphasis of
this guideline was on varicose vein management. In 2012,
SVS and AVF clinical practice guidelines addressing early
thrombus removal strategies for acute venous thrombosis
were published.24 Again, whereas there is some crossover
regarding the impact of early venous thrombosis on
restored venous patency, potential preserved valvular
function, and decreased post-thrombotic morbidity, there
was little
