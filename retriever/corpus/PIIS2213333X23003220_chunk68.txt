patients with chronic venous disorders describing the
clinical, etiologic, anatomical, and pathophysiologic features. Conceptually, however, it has often been pondered
whether patients with varicose veins (C2) can undergo
treatment to prevent progression to CVI later in life. In
the Bonn Vein Study,128 1978 participants were followed
up for a mean of 6.6 years. The prevalence of varicose
veins rose from 22.7% to 25.1% (Table X). Participants with
C2 disease increased to higher C-classes in 19.8% for

nonsaphenous varicose veins and in 31.8% for saphenous
varicose veins. The main risk factor for progression
was obesity. The Edinburgh Vein Study had a 13-year
follow-up; a progression rate of 57.8% (4.3% per year)
was reported, of those with C2 disease at baseline, 31.9%
progressed to CVI.126 Risk factors for progression
included a family history of varicose veins, previous DVT
and obesity. Kostas et al followed 73 mostly asymptomatic contralateral limbs for 5 years in patients who
