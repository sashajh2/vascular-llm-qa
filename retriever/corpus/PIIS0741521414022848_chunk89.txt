 within
the ﬁrst year of graft implantation; however, vein grafts
are never entirely free of the risk of developing stenosis.
The risk of developing vein graft stenosis appears greater
in operations performed for CLI, in operations performed
with smaller-caliber venous conduits, procedures using
nonsaphenous vein conduits, and in vein grafts with
anastomosis to more distal (tibial or pedal) arteries. Surveillance protocols for lower extremity autogenous vein
graft reconstructions were developed to detect graft stenosis before graft thrombosis and were based on this
natural history and the assumption that a patent, hemodynamically uncompromised, lower extremity arterial
reconstruction is optimal for maintaining ambulatory
function and QoL. Failure of an arterial reconstruction
performed for claudication will, at the very least, return
the patient to his or her previous level of preoperative
disability but may occasionally result in more severe
symptoms, including limb-threatening ischemia. In addition, performing a secondary bypass for a thrombosed
lower extremity vein graft is technically more difﬁcult and
complex than treatment of a failing but still patent graft.
Surveillance programs of lower extremity vein grafts may
be solely clinical or both clinical and vascular laboratory based.
The Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC II) working group recommended
patients treated with lower extremity vein grafts be monitored
for at least 2 years with a clinical surveillance program that
consists of an interval history to detect new symptoms, pulse
examination, and measurement of resting and, if possible,
postexercise ABIs.9 However, most vein graft arterial reconstructions are thought to fail through the development of
intrinsic stenotic lesions within the venous conduit, at anastomotic sites, or in the outﬂow artery distal to the distal anastomosis. Most of these lesions occur within the ﬁrst 12 to
18 months after surgery but can continue to develop or progress years later. Relying on clinical assessment alone may miss
critical vein graft stenoses that threaten graft thrombosis, especially in patients treated for CLI (see below). Vascular
laboratory-based surveillance programs of lower extremity
vein grafts focus on detection using duplex ultrasound
