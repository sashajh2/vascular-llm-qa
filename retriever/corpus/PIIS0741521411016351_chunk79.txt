 performed, length of cardiopulmonary bypass, and the status of the aortic arch, among a
variety of other risk factors, are important in determining
overall stroke risk after CABG.271,276 The best results,
stroke/death rates of 2.2%, have been reported for offpump CABG and synchronous CEA, although there is
likely a significant influence of patient selection in these
series.277 It is also possible that the presence of carotid
stenosis is a surrogate marker for stroke risk, rather than a
preventable, direct cause (as evidenced by patients with
unilateral carotid occlusion who exhibit the highest perioperative rates of CVA).269
In summary, significant indirect evidence suggests that
treatment of neurologically symptomatic carotid stenosis or
patients with bilateral asymptomatic severe disease may
reduce the incidence of perioperative CVA in patients
undergoing cardiac surgery. The data on treatment of
unilateral asymptomatic stenosis â¬Ž70% suggest CEA before or in combination with CABG is reasonable in centers
of excellence but the data at this point are insufficient to
make a firm recommendation. Local results are critical in
determining appropriate therapy.
When coronary intervention can be performed percutaneously, this should precede carotid intervention.
Data indicating trends toward improved outcomes for
simultaneous performance of the surgical procedures at
institutions that manage these conditions regularly are
not sufficiently robust to support a definitive recommendation. More recently, some studies suggested a potential role for CAS before CABG, with a trend toward
decreased stroke rates in the patients treated with
CAS.278,279 A review of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample found the risk of perioperative stroke was 62% higher
for combined CEA and CABG (3.9%) compared with
combined CAS and CABG (2.4%), with an OR of 1.62
(95% CI, 1.1-2.5).278
If a sequential strategy is planned, CABG may need to
be deferred for 2 to 4 weeks because of the need for
dual-antiplatelet therapy after CAS. This has resulted in
