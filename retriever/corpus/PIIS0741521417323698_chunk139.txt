 for thrombosis cannot be
determined, femoral-femoral bypass should be considered. Simple thrombectomy or thrombolysis will often
lead to recurrent early thrombosis. Five-year patency for
a femoral-femoral bypass graft, when it is placed in the
treatment of aneurysmal disease, exceeds 80%.689,690
We recommend that follow-up of patients after aneurysm
repair include a thorough lower extremity pulse
examination or ABI.

We recommend a prompt evaluation for possible graft limb
occlusion if patients develop new-onset lower extremity
claudication, ischemia, or reduction in ABI after aneurysm
repair.

Graft infection. All implanted aortic prostheses are at
risk for infection either at implantation or later by hematogenous seeding. Although graft infection is rare with
an incidence of 0.3%,691 historically, it has been the
indication for intervention in up to 25% of redo aortic
surgery.681 Although controversial, the risk of graft infection may be lower after EVAR than after open repair,
perhaps because of delivery of the endoprosthesis
through a completely enclosed system.686,692 However,
the EVAR 1 trial had a comparable incidence of device
infection between EVAR and open repair during a 4-year
follow-up period.682 Similarly, in a recent analysis of
>45,000 Medicare beneﬁciaries, graft infections or aortoenteric ﬁstulas 4 years after EVAR or open repair were
comparable for both groups (w0.3%).86 Likewise, Vogel
and coworkers reported a nearly identical 2-year incidence of graft infection (<0.2%) for OSR or EVAR in a
review of 14,000 patients undergoing aneurysm repair.693
Graft infection after EVAR or open repair may occur in
isolation or with an aortoenteric ﬁstula.694,695
Whereas aortic graft infection presents on average 3
years or later after
