variability in reporting of aneurysm diameter, particularly
in research studies, which have included diameter
measurements based on outer wall to outer wall, inner
wall to inner wall, and anterior outer wall to posterior
inner wall.191 Diameter measurements based on orthogonal rendering as well as path lengths and centerline
measurements have been largely superseded by the
adoption of three-dimensional reformatting software
and dedicated computer workstations to obtain curved
multiplanar reformatted images.192
The increasingly small size and low cost of portable
ultrasound units and absence of radiation or administration of nephrotoxic contrast material with ultrasound
have made it the preferred technique for aneurysm
screening and surveillance.193-195 However, aneurysm
diameter measurements, whether through the use of
CT or ultrasound imaging, are most reliable and reproducible when standardized measurement techniques
are used and the maximum transverse dimension
measured orthogonal to the vessel axis is reported. Moreover, it is essential that ultrasound
