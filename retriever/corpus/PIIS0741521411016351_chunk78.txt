 patients is not possible
at this time. It remains uncertain if correction of carotid
disease before cardiac surgery is effective in lowering the
perioperative rate of CVA for those patients. Only two
randomized controlled trials have compared combined
CEA/CABG with a strategy of CABG first and delayed
CEA in patients with unilateral asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Hertzer et al274 demonstrated reduced combined

stroke/death rates for combined CEA/CABG compared
to staged CEA (5.6% vs 17%). The stroke rate associated
with the “unprotected” CABG was 7.4%, compared to a
stroke rate of 2.8% with combined CEA/CABG. Recently,
Illuminati et al275 reported randomizing 185 patients with
unilateral severe (⬎80%) asymptomatic carotid stenosis, in
whom aortic arch disease had been excluded by preoperative CT scan, between “protected” CABG (15 CEA first,
79 combined CEA and CABG) and “unprotected” CABG
with CEA performed at a later time (within 3 months) (91
patients). There were no strokes in the “protected” group,
compared to 7 strokes (3 early, 4 later) in the “unprotected” group. All strokes were ipsilateral to the stenosis
and occurred before CEA was performed. These two reports suggest that patients with asymptomatic unilateral
severe stenosis may benefit from CEA before or with CABG
in centers with considerable experience. However, further
studies are required before a general recommendation can
be made. Other factors, including the specific nature of the
cardiac surgery being performed, length of cardiopulmonary bypass, and the status of the aortic arch, among a
variety of other risk factors, are important in determining
overall stroke risk after CABG.271,276 The best results,
stroke/death rates of 2.2%, have been reported for offpump CABG and synchronous CEA, although there is
likely a significant influence of patient selection in these
series.277 It is also possible that
