omechanical thrombolysis.17,74 Limited data suggest that these devices should be used in
conjunction with pharmacologic lytic agents, significant
lysis (⬎50%) being achieved in only one-third of patients
treated with mechanical devices alone.70 The use of mechanical devices alone, without the concurrent use of
thrombolytic drugs, cannot be routinely recommended.
A systematic review of 16 retrospective case series that
used a pharmacomechanical approach with a variety of
thrombolytic devices reported ⬎50% lysis in 83% to 100%
of patients. Although complication rates should be viewed
with caution, these studies reported no procedure-related
deaths or strokes, a ⬍1% incidence of PE, and no major
bleeding complications, although 4.2% to 14% of patients
required a transfusion.17 A similar systematic review of
eight cases series also found no major periprocedural bleeding complications or deaths.74
Although randomized clinical trials are lacking, two
small cohort studies compared pharmacomechanical
thrombolysis with catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis. Lin et al reported that although rates of complete
thrombolysis were similar for pharmacomechanical and
catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis (75% vs
70%), infusion times (76 ⫾ 34 minutes vs 18 ⫾ 8 hours)
and costs (mean cost difference $37, 609) were significantly less with pharmacomechanical thrombolysis. There
was no difference in bleeding complications, although patients undergoing pharmacomechanical thrombolysis required fewer transfusions (0.2 vs 1.2 units). The second
small study (n ⫽ 45) similarly demonstrated shorter treatment times (30.3 ⫾ 17.8 vs 56.5 ⫾ 27.4 hours) and lower
urokinase doses (2.95 ⫾ 1.8 million U vs 6.70 ⫾ 5.90
million U) for adjunctive pharmacomechanical thrombolysis compared with catheter-directed pharmacologic
