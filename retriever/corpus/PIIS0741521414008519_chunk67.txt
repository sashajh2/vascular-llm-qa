Modiﬁed from Vasquez MA, Rabe E, McLafferty RB, Shortell CK, Marston WA, Gillespie D, et al. Revision of the venous clinical severity score:
Venous outcomes consensus statement: Special communication of the American Venous Forum Ad Hoc Outcomes Working Group. J Vasc Surg
2010;52:1387-96.

On the basis of the association of chronic PTS with
VLUs, additional classiﬁcation of PTS should be performed
for all patients with prior DVT. Several PTS scoring systems have been used both to diagnose and to classify
PTS severity, including those described by Villalta,195 Ginsberg,196 Brandjes,197 and Widmer.198 Of these PTS
scoring systems, the Villalta score (Table VII) has the highest degree of validation and has been shown to have excellent interobserver reliability, association with ambulatory
venous pressures, correlation with severity of PTS, and ability to assess change in condition over time.199-205 Evidence
supports use of Villalta scoring in all patients with VLU and
prior documented DVT to determine diagnosis, severity,

and treatment outcomes of PTS, with consensus recommendation to combine Villalta with CEAP for more accurate diagnosis of PTS.206
Additional venous disease evaluation should include
patient-oriented quality of life (QOL) assessment. Both

and venous diseaseespeciﬁc (Venous Insufﬁciency Epidemiologic and Economic Study of Quality of Life/Symptoms (VEINES-QOL/Sym) questionnaires, the Chronic
Venous Insufﬁciency Questionnaire (CIVIQ), the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), and the Charing Cross Venous Ulceration Questionnaire (CXVUQ))
have been used and validated for patients with venous
