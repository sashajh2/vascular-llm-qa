Diabetes mellitus. Diabetic patients have increased
operative mortality after AAA repair, with reduced

survival 2 to 5 years after surgery, consistent with an
increased burden of cardiovascular disease.143 However,
whether diabetes is a distinct risk factor for major
adverse events or death after OSR or EVAR is not well
deﬁned.144-148
Metformin is a ﬁrst-line medication for the treatment of
type 2 diabetes and prescribed for >100 million patients
worldwide. Metformin is contraindicated if the eGFR is
below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 because of the risk of lactic
acidosis, which carries a mortality of up to 50%.149 Given
the risk of CIN after conventional or CT angiography and
the association of metformin with lactic acidosis among
patients with renal insufﬁciency, an eGFR of <60 mL/min
should prompt the cessation of metformin either at the
time of administration of contrast material or up to 48
hours before if eGFR is <45 mL/min.150 Metformin should
be restarted no sooner than 48 hours after administration of contrast material as long as renal function has
remained stable (<25% increase in creatinine concentration above baseline).150
We recommend holding metformin at the time of
administration of contrast material among patients with an
eGFR of <60 mL/min or up to 48 hours before
administration of contrast material if the eGFR is <45 mL/min.
