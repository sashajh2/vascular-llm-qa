We suggest thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated or
low-molecular-weight heparin for patients undergoing
aneurysm repair at moderate to high risk for venous
thromboembolism and low risk for bleeding.

Postoperative blood transfusion. A threshold for blood
transfusion after OSR or EVAR has not been established. A
number of studies suggest that anemia or a low hemoglobin level is associated with increased mortality after open
AAA repair.110,152 In a review of a statewide database,
transfusion after major vascular procedures occurred in
25% of patients at a median hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL.
Perioperative transfusion was independently associated
with death, MI, and pneumonia.622 A hemoglobin concentration of <7 g/dL has been recommended as a transfusion threshold for a number of high-risk conditions in
both critical and ambulatory care.623 Given the prevalence
of coronary artery disease among patients undergoing
vascular surgery, blood transfusion for a hemoglobin concentration of <10 g/dL has been a common practice.
However, a meta-analysis comparing transfusion thresholds of 7 to 8 g/dL and 9 to 10 g/dL did not discern a difference in outcome for patients undergoing either cardiac or
vascular surgery.624 In this regard, motivated by a desire to
reduce the established risks of blood transfusion, to
decrease blood use, and to lower costs, a recent Cochrane
analysis supported more restrictive guidelines for all patients, including those with cardiovascular disease.625
Therefore, on the basis of currently available evidence, in
the absence of ongoing blood loss, transfusion during or
after OSR or EVAR is recommended only if the hemoglobin
concentration is at or below 7 g/dL.
In the absence of ongoing blood loss, we suggest a threshold
for blood transfusion during or after aneurysm repair at a
hemoglobin concentration of 7 g/dL or below.
