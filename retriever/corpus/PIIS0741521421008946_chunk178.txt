acher et al583 did
not show a difference in in-patient stroke/death risk

based on operator volume. However physician categories
were deﬁned as low (<10 cases/year), medium (9-23
cases/year) and high (>23 cases/year), although other
studies deﬁned this factor differently.
Calvert et al576 reported the results of pooled analysis
from the Carotid Stenting Trialists Collaboration. This
included the EVA-3S trial, the SPACE trial, and the ICSS.
In this study of 1546 CAS patients, neither lifetime stenting experience excluding the carotid nor lifetime CAS
experience impacted 30-day risk of death or stroke. However, annual in-trial CAS operator volume signiﬁcantly
impacted outcomes such that low-volume providers
(mean of #3.2 CAS/year) had a 30-day stroke/death risk
of 10%, intermediate-volume providers (3.2-5.6 CAS/
year) had a 30-day stroke/death risk of 8.4%, and with
high-volume providers (>5.6 CAS/year), had 30-day
stroke/death risk of 5.1%.
In a systematic review of outcomes from a registry and
four large case series, it was noted that in active CAS centers it took almost 2 years of experience before 30-day
stroke/death risk fell below 5%.584 A large high-risk for
CEA registry, showed that a lifetime experience of 72
CAS procedures was needed to achieve 30-day stroke/
death risk of less than 3% in asymptomatic patients
less than 80 years of age.577 In an analysis of Medicare
beneﬁciaries, Nallamothu et al205 showed that 30-day
mortality was signiﬁcantly higher when practitioners performed fewer than six CAS procedures per year,
compared with more than 24 (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.7;
P < .001). Setacci et al585 reported data from a large
single-center series involving 2124 CAS procedures and
showed that a lifetime experience of more than 100
CAS
