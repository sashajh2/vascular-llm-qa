 made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, incorporating the strength of the
recommendation (strong: 1; weak: 2) and an evaluation of the level of the evidence (A to C).
Results: On the basis of the best evidence currently available, we recommend against routine use of the term “proximal
venous thrombosis” in favor of more precise characterization of thrombi as involving the iliofemoral or femoropopliteal
venous segments (Grade 1A). We further suggest the use of early thrombus removal strategies in ambulatory patients with
good functional capacity and a first episode of iliofemoral DVT of <14 days in duration (Grade 2C) and strongly
recommend their use in patients with limb-threatening ischemia due to iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction (Grade
1A). We suggest pharmacomechanical strategies over catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis alone if resources are
available and that surgical thrombectomy be considered if thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated (Grade 2C).
Conclusions: Most data regarding early thrombus removal strategies are of low quality but do suggest patientimportant benefits with respect to reducing postthrombotic morbidity. We anticipate revision of these guidelines as
additional evidence becomes available. ( J Vasc Surg 2012;55:1449-62.)
