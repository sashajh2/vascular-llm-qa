1368 CEA patients.
Other studies of larger databases7,8,201,215 have yielded
similar results.
Further conclusions on the role of intervention in
asymptomatic patients await the results of two additional
randomized prospective studies designed to compare the
early and long-term results of CEA vs CAS and best medical
management: The Carotid Stenting vs Surgery of Severe
Carotid Artery Disease and Stroke Prevention in Asymptomatic Patients (ACT I) and, the Asymptomatic Carotid

Ricotta et al e17

Surgery Trial (ACST-2).227 Results are not expected until
at least 2018.
3. Medical management of asymptomatic carotid
stenosis. There has been an increasing call for trials to
compare modern medical management of carotid stenosis
with both CEA and CAS.213,214 This is based on the
relatively modest absolute stroke reduction in both ACAS
and ACST,5,6 the effect of optimal medical management on
stroke risk (see Section III), and the rates of stroke reported
in SAPPHIRE and many carotid stent registries, all of
which contain a significant number of asymptomatic patients. Operation for asymptomatic carotid stenosis should
only be undertaken in good-risk patients where excellent
results can be documented. In patients with a short life
expectancy or multiple risk factors, medical management is
likely to be superior to intervention. As noted, several
studies have been designed to test the ultimate role of
medical vs interventional management in asymptomatic
carotid disease.
C. Neurologically symptomatic patients with 50% or
greater carotid artery stenosis
1. CEA in symptomatic stenosis. NASCET and
ECST both demonstrated the benefit of CEA in neurologically symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis that reduced diameter ⬎50%.2-4 NASCET demonstrated an absolute risk reduction in stroke of 17% at 2 years (24% in
medical arm vs 7% in surgical arm) for patients with ⬎70%
carotid stenosis. ECST demonstrated a similar stroke risk in
this group after 3 years
