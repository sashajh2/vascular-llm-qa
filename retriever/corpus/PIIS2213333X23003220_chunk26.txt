 a consensus meeting of international experts
in 1994,48 it was updated in 2004,49 and most recently in
2020.50 The classiﬁcation is based on clinical signs, etiology, anatomy and pathology (reﬂux and obstruction) of
chronic venous disorders. The basic or clinical CEAP classiﬁcation reports the single highest C class, and the
advanced CEAP reports all C classes present in the limb.
Patients with reticular veins (subdermal veins between 1
and <3 mm in diameter) and telangiectasias (subdermal
spider veins, <1 mm in size) belong to Class C1. Varicose
veins are dilated subcutaneous tributaries $3 mm in
diameter and patients with varicose veins belong to CEAP
Class C2. CVD is deﬁned as CEAP Class C2 to C6, CVI includes limbs with CEAP Class 3 to 6.49-52 The term CVI is
reserved for advanced CVD with functional abnormalities
of the venous system producing edema, skin changes, or
venous leg ulcers.51 Each clinical class has a subscript
indicating the presence or absence of symptoms (s or a).
Symptoms of varicose veins may include pain, burning,
cramping, feeling of limb heaviness or swelling, restless leg
or itching. The most important of these have been identiﬁed as HASTI symptoms and include heaviness in the
legs, achiness, swelling, throbbing, and itching.53,54 CEAP is

a descriptive instrument designed to categorize the
affected limb and not a quantitative severity scale, scoring
system, or an outcome measure that reﬂects changes over
time. For a table of the updated CEAP classiﬁcation please
see Part I of the Guidelines.8
1.1.2. We recommend the use of the revised Venous
Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) for patients with chronic
venous disorders for grading of clinical severity and for
assessment of post treatment outcome.
