Other medical conditions that can cause leg ulcers and
affect ulcer healing should also be identiﬁed. Differential

Guideline 3.3: Wound Documentation
We recommend serial venous leg ulcer wound measurement and documentation. [BEST PRACTICE]

Serial VLU wound measurement and documentation
are important to determine baseline markers and effect of
subsequent treatment measures on healing parameters.
Documentation should include number and position of
ulcers on the leg. Wound measurements should be
made for each VLU, including area, perimeter, and
depth, with additional descriptors of wound edge parameters, wound base quality, drainage, and infection.

Adjuncts for standardization of ulcer documentation,
including wound planimetry, digital photography, and
digital planimetry software, are recommended.102-113

Guideline 3.4: Wound Culture
We suggest against routine culture of venous leg ulcers and only to obtain wound culture specimens when
clinical evidence of infection is present. [GRADE - 2;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
There is no evidence to support routine microbiology
surface cultures of VLU in the absence of clinical signs of
infection as these wounds are usually colonized by multiple
micro-organisms. If there are no clinical signs of infection
and the wound is responding to treatment, there is no indication to culture the wound.114-118
For patients with VLUs who develop associated clinical
signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, worsening
