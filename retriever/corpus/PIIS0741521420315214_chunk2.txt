 treatment using a minimally invasive approach is largely based on anatomic eligibility
rather than on patient-speciﬁc factors, as is the case in open TAA repair. Thus, for isolated lesions of the DTA, TEVAR
should be the primary method of repair in both the elective and emergent setting based on improved short-term and
midterm mortality as well as decreased morbidity. (J Vasc Surg 2021;73:55S-83S.)
