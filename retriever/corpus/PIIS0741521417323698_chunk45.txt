We suggest continuation of beta blocker therapy during the
perioperative period if it is part of an established medical
regimen.

If a decision was made to start beta blocker therapy (because
of the presence of multiple risk factors, such as coronary
artery disease, renal insufﬁciency, and diabetes), we suggest
initiation well in advance of surgery to allow sufﬁcient time
to assess safety and tolerability.

In patients who may need aneurysm repair in the subsequent
12 months and in whom percutaneous coronary
intervention is indicated, we suggest a strategy of balloon
angioplasty or bare-metal stent placement, followed by 4 to
6 weeks of dual antiplatelet therapy.

We suggest deferring elective aneurysm repair for 30 days
after bare-metal stent placement or coronary artery bypass
surgery if clinical circumstances permit. As an alternative,
EVAR may be performed with uninterrupted continuation
of dual antiplatelet therapy.

reported that COPD is an independent predictor of
mortality after open repair,34,109 with the severity of
pulmonary disease and the capacity to optimize preoperative respiratory function inﬂuencing outcome.110 EVAR
is better tolerated than OSR, particularly if EVAR is
performed under local anesthesia.111,112 However, patients
with severe COPD exhibit increased in-hospital mortality,
pulmonary complications, major adverse events, and
