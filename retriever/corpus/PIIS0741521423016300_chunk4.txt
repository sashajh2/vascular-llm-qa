rene, evaluate
pedal Doppler waveforms in combination with ankle brachial
index (ABI) and toe brachial index (TBI) measurements to identify
the presence of peripheral artery disease (PAD).
No single modality has been shown to be optimal for the diagnosis
of PAD, and there is no value above which PAD can be excluded.
However, PAD is less likely in the presence of ABI 0.9 e 1.3; TBI $
0.70; and triphasic or biphasic pedal Doppler waveforms.
5. In a person with diabetes without a foot ulcer in whom a
non-emergency invasive foot procedure is being considered,
peripheral artery disease should be excluded by performing
assessment of pedal Doppler waveforms in combination with
ankle brachial index and toe brachial index.

Prognosis

6. In a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene, consider
performing ankle pressures and ankle brachial index (ABI)
measurements to assist in the assessment of likelihood of healing
and amputation.
Ankle pressure and ABI are weak predictors of healing. A low
ankle pressure (e.g., < 50 mmHg) or ABI (e.g., < 0.5) may be
associated with a greater likelihood of impaired healing and
greater likelihood of major amputation.
7. In a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene, consider
performing a toe pressure measurement to assess likelihood of
healing and amputation.
A toe pressure $ 30 mmHg increases the pre-test probability of
healing by up to 30% and a value < 30 mmHg increases the
pre-test probability of major amputation by approximately 20%.
8. In a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene, if a toe
pressure cannot be performed, consider performing a transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) measurement or a skin perfusion
pressure (SPP) to assess likelihood of healing.
A TcPO2 $ 25 mmHg increases the pre-test probability of healing
by up to 45% and value < 25 mmHg increases the pre-test probability of major amputation by approximately 20%. An SPP $ 40
mmHg increases the pre-test probability of healing by
