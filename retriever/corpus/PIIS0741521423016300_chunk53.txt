 approach. People
with CLTI who were deemed appropriate for revascularisation for infrainguinal arterial occlusive disease were
included.111 The primary outcome was above ankle
amputation of the index limb or a major reintervention in the index limb (new bypass, vein graft
interposition revision, thrombectomy or thrombolysis)
or death. It was designed in two parallel cohort trials:
Cohort 1 people who had an adequate single segment
great saphenous vein (GSV) available for use as a bypass
conduit, and Cohort 2 people without an adequate single segment GSV who required an alternate conduit.
Treatment with a GSV bypass ﬁrst approach was superior
to endovascular therapy ﬁrst for the primary outcome
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI]
0.59 e 0.79; p < .001). In Cohort 2 the primary outcomes
were similar between the two groups. Subgroup analysis
of people in Cohort 1 favoured surgery in people with diabetes (HR 0.72; CI 0.61 e 0.86) with beneﬁt comparable
with those without diabetes (HR 0.57; CI 0.41 e 0.78). At
the time of writing this guideline, further results of this
study have not been published. Of note, whole group
data for Cohort 1 demonstrated a higher rate of major
amputation in those undergoing an endovascular

procedure compared with those having surgery (Surgery:
74/709 [10.4%] Endovascular: 106/711 [14.9%]). Further
subanalysis may demonstrate this is relevant to those
with diabetes and therefore this may affect an individual’s preference for intervention. From the perspective
of the person receiving treatment, the difference in
length of hospital stay should be taken into account,
which in the systematic review was longer in the bypass
publications than in endovascular publications. In addition, people might prefer to have an endovascular
approach given the more invasive approach of bypass
surgery.
