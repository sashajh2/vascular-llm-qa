We recommend noninvasive imaging with transabdominal and/or transvaginal
ultrasonography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance venography
in selected patients with symptoms of pelvic congestion syndrome or
symptomatic varices in the distribution of the pubis, labia, perineum, or
buttocks.
We recommend retrograde ovarian and internal iliac venography in patients
with pelvic venous disease, confirmed or suspected by noninvasive imaging
studies, in whom intervention is planned.
We suggest treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome and pelvic varices with
coil embolization, plugs, or transcatheter sclerotherapy, used alone or
together.
If less invasive treatment is not available or has failed, we suggest surgical
ligation and excision of ovarian veins to treat reflux.

value for pelvic varices.373 MR and CT venography criteria
for pelvic venous varices include four or more tortuous
parauterine veins, parauterine veins ⬎4 mm in diameter,
and an ovarian vein diameter ⬎8 mm.374
Retrograde ovarian and internal iliac venography is the
test of choice for the diagnosis of pelvic venous disorders,
although it is most often reserved for patients in whom
intervention is planned. Venographic criteria for pelvic
congestion syndrome include one or more of the following:
(1) an ovarian vein diameter of ⱖ6 mm, (2) contrast
retention for ⱖ20 seconds, (3) congestion of the pelvic
venous plexus and/or opacification of the ipsilateral (or
contralateral) internal iliac vein, or (4) filling of vulvovaginal and thigh varicosities.375
Treatment. Various nonsurgical and surgical approaches are available to treat pelvic congestion syndrome.
Pharmacologic agents to suppress ovarian function, such as
medroxyprogesterone or gonadotropin-releasing hormone, may offer short-term pain relief, but their long-term
effectiveness has not been proven. Surgical approaches,
