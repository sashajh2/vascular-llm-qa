 with greater
primary patency at 1 year (OR, 2.13;
95% CI, 1.45-3.14) and 3 years (OR, 1.41;
95% CI, 0.99-2.01), lower occlusion
rate at 30 days (OR, 0.41; 95% CI,
0.24-0.68), and fewer reinterventions
but longer hospital stay and more
wound complications; no signiÔ¨Åcant
difference was found in mortality
(OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.06-1.36 at 30 days;
OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.21-1.17 at longest
follow up), secondary patency (OR,
1.59; 95% CI, 0.92-3.07 at 1 year), or
amputation rate (OR, 0.85; 95% CI,
0.56-1.31) between OPAR and EPAR;
certainty for these estimates was, in
general, low
