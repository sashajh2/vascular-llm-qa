 femoral artery. A randomized study
comparing open exposure and the percutaneous “preclose” technique using the Perclose ProGlide (Abbott
Vascular, Santa Clara, Calif) device demonstrated both
safety and effectiveness.314 After femoral artery access,
systemic anticoagulation with 100 units/kg of intravenous heparin is recommended with a target activated
clotting time $300 seconds.
Infrarenal ﬁxation. EVAR requires nonaneurysmal
proximal and distal attachment sites or sealing zones
as dictated by device-speciﬁc instructions for use.
Most endografts that are dependent on infrarenal ﬁxation have required a proximal sealing zone of at least
15 mm in length, a neck diameter <32 mm, and a neck
angulation of <60 degrees. Several devices now report
efﬁcacy with shorter neck lengths and more severe
levels of angulations. Use of devices outside recommended parameters increases the risk of device
migration, delayed type IA endoleaks, and aneurysm
rupture.
Suprarenal ﬁxation. Suprarenal ﬁxation has been
proposed as a more effective means of proximal ﬁxation
when the morphologic features of the proximal aortic

neck are unfavorable, including shortened neck length,
severe angulation, reverse taper, barrel-shaped neck,
circumferential mural thrombus, and extensive neck
calciﬁcation. Whereas concerns have been raised about
the risks of renal or mesenteric embolization, occlusion,
and end-organ ischemia, observational studies have
documented the efﬁcacy and safety of suprarenal
ﬁxation.315-319 The rate of renal dysfunction appears to
be equivalent for endografts that use nitinol or stainless
steel transrenal stents and not signiﬁcantly different
from that observed with infrarenal ﬁxation.318 Although
suprarenal ﬁxation may produce a higher incidence of
small renal infarcts, these do not appear to be clinically
signiﬁcant in most patients. Ren
