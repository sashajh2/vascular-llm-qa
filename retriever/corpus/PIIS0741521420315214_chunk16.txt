 recommendations, a systematic review
and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of TEVAR and open repair in patients with isolated TAA.5 The data sources for this evidence review
included PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, EBSCO
CINAHL, and Scopus, which were searched from each database’s inception to January 29, 2016. Observational
studies that compared the two approaches in adults
with TAA and reported 30-day mortality or procedure
complications were selected. Data were extracted and
appraised by two reviewers independently. Random

effects meta-analysis was used to estimate odds ratio (OR)
and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs). This document provided evidence that TEVAR reduced the risk of mortality
in both intact (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.36-0.99) and ruptured
(OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38-0.88) settings. In addition, paraplegia risks and pulmonary complication rates were lower
with TEVAR compared with open repair for isolated TAA.

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS
Thoracic aortic disease is an important public health
issue.6-10 Although abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs)
and ascending aortic aneurysms are more common,
descending TAAs and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) are not rare, with an estimated incidence
of 6 to 10 cases per 100,000 person-years.5,10 Olsson et al11
examined the prevalence of TAA from 1987 to 2002 in
patients with thoracic aortic dissections (ADs) or aneurysms in Sweden. Of 14,229 individuals with thoracic
aortic disease, the diagnosis was made in 11,039 (78%)
before death. The incidence of thoracic aortic disease
rose by 52% in men and 28% in women to reach 16.3
