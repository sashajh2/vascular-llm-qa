 to reduce early rethrombosis; and
carefully monitored postoperative anticoagulation.15,84
Although thrombectomy does appear to be associated with improved long-term outcomes after iliofemoral DVT, the overall quality of the data supporting its use
is low, and there are little data allowing a reliable estimate of risk vs benefits in an individual patient19 (Grade
2C). The interval estimates are wide, but there is a trend

toward better outcomes with catheter-directed thrombolysis than with thrombectomy with respect to the risk
of the postthrombotic syndrome (RR, 0.33; 95% CI,
0.00-2.28), venous reflux (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.052.10), and venous obstruction (RR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.012.13).8 We acknowledge that these data suffer from
indirect comparison, wide CIs, and potential confounding by the discordant time intervals during which the
studies were performed.
In recommending the thrombolytic techniques over
surgical thrombectomy in patients who are candidates for
either approach, a higher value is placed on avoiding the
more invasive procedure and potential surgical complications than on unknown differences in bleeding rates. However, given the more invasive nature, the limited experience
of most surgeons, and the potentially greater risk of complications with surgical thrombectomy, the weight of the
evidence would seem to favor percutaneous thrombolytic
approaches over surgical thrombectomy in patients without
contraindications to thrombolytic agents.

echanical procedures, there were no symptomatic
periprocedural PE among those with (20%) or without
IVC filters.69 Although there may have been a selection
bias among those undergoing prophylactic filter placement, these results were achieved despite thrombus extending into the IVC in 30% of patients. Other small
series85 have similarly reported asymptomatic emboli
captured by IVC filters in similar proportions of patients
undergoing catheter-directed or pharmacomechanical
