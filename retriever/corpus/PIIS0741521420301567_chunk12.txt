 mortality, we recommend that all hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms, regardless of cause, be repaired
as soon as the diagnosis is made. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High).
2.2.a: We recommend repair of all symptomatic HAAs
regardless of size. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1
(Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High).
2.2.b: In asymptomatic patients without signiﬁcant
comorbidity, we recommend repair if true HAA is
>2 cm, Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: A (High), or if aneurysm enlarges
>0.5 cm/y, Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: C (Low). In patients with signiﬁcant
comorbidities, we recommend repair if HAA is >5.0 cm.
Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality
of Evidence: B (Moderate).
2.3. We recommend repair of HAA in patients with vasculopathy or vasculitis, regardless of size, Level of
Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: C (Low). We recommend repair in HAA patients
with positive blood cultures, Level of Recommendation:
Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
3.1: We recommend an endovascular-ﬁrst approach to
all HAAs if it is anatomically feasible (ie, if this approach
maintains arterial circulation to the liver). Level of
Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence:
A (High).
3.2: In patients with extrahepatic aneurysms, we recommend open and endovascular techniques to maintain
liver circulation. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1
(Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High).
3.3: In patients with intrahepatic aneurysms, we recommend coil embolization of the affected artery, Level of
Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate). In patients with large intrahepatic
aneurysms, we recommend resection of the involved
lobe of liver to avoid signiﬁcant liver necrosis, Level of
Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of
