, device failure (fracture, migration, component separation),
stenosis, or occlusion. In addition, long-term evaluation
may detect signs of graft infection. The most often reported protocol after TEVAR for aneurysm surveillance
is clinical examination and CT scans at 1 month,
6 months, and yearly thereafter.206,207 When TEVAR is
placed for emergent indications, earlier evaluation either
during hospitalization or within 1 week of placement
may be warranted.208
Difﬁculties in establishing surveillance protocols
include variability in reporting of institutional protocols
as well as reported rates of reintervention vs reporting

of new ﬁndings in the surveillance protocols. Low reintervention rates could imply the absence of signiﬁcant ﬁndings on surveillance imaging or a lack of intervention
despite the presence of new ﬁndings. Conversely, high
reported reintervention rates could reﬂect either a high
rate of signiﬁcant ﬁndings or simply a more aggressive
approach to the ﬁndings treated conservatively at other
institutions. Recent evidence also shows that TEVAR
surveillance may be best tailored to the indication
for the TEVAR as certain pathologic processes may
warrant more frequent surveillance. A publication by
Meena et al209 evaluated 203 patients treated with
TEVAR with follow-up CT scans and demonstrated
aorta-related complications in 35% of patients, with sac
expansion accounting for 77% of these.
Whereas long-term outcomes are beginning to be reported, patients undergoing TEVAR for DTA aneurysm
with straightforward anatomy and who ﬁt within the device’s instructions for use criteria rarely require late reintervention. In a series of 82 patients treated for TAA,
only 11% required reintervention at 60 months of
follow-up.206 Indications for reintervention were type I
endoleaks in about 7% and infection and type III endoleaks in 1% each. No secondary intervention was performed for aneurysm expansion or endograft collapse.206
In contrast, 63 consecutive patients treated in Essen,
Germany, with TEVAR for PA
