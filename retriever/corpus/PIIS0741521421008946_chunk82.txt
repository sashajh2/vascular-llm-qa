, 0.63; P ¼ .004)
Stroke/death (OR, 0.58; P < .0001)
Late restenosis (OR, 0.45; P ¼ .004)
ECEA vs patched CCEA: there were no differences between the two procedures, except for
neck hematoma, where ECEA was better than
patched CCEA

Population/Comparison
29 studies (20 Observational
Studies, 9 RCTs)
13,219 CEAs

Outcome
PRC group had higher overall 30-day stroke risk
(OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-2.9)
Difference was not statistically signiﬁcant
anymore, after exclusion of nonrandomized
studies (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.8-3.9)
Restenosis rate was higher after PRC (OR, 2.2;
95% CI, 1.4-3.4)
Concluded that compared with PRC, perioperative stroke rate was lower after patch closure
Restenosis rate was higher after PRC, although
the clinical signiﬁcance of this ﬁnding remained
unclear in terms of long-term stroke prevention
To be noted, many of these primary closures
were selected in relatively larger arteries
