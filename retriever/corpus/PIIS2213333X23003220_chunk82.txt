5.2.6. In patients with an epifascial or superﬁcial
saphenous vein, thermal ablation may result in skin
burns, hyperpigmentation, or induration, while
nonthermal techniques may cause hyperpigmentation
or induration. Miniphlebectomy or limited stripping is
safe and effective, if the saphenous vein is close to
the skin (<0.5 cm).
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Thermal techniques pose the potential for
skin burn if the area of ablation is close to the skin. Use
of tumescence anesthesia helps overcome this problem
