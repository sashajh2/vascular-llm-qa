 endoleak or aneurysm reperfusion that could lead to a continued risk of
aneurysm growth or rupture. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B
(Moderate).
Gastric and gastroepiploic artery aneurysms. 1.1: In patients who are thought to have gastric or gastroepiploic
artery aneurysms, we recommend computed tomography angiography (CTA) as the diagnostic tool of choice.
Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality
of Evidence: B (Moderate).
1.2: In patients who are thought to have gastric and gastroepiploic artery aneurysms and have high radiation
exposure risks or renal insufﬁciency, we recommend
non-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for diagnosis. Level of Recommendation:
Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
Technical remark: Non-contrast-enhanced MRA is best
suited to children and women of childbearing potential
or those who have contraindications to CTA or MRA
contrast materials (ie, pregnancy, renal insufﬁciency, or
gadolinium contrast material allergy).
1.3: We recommend the use of catheter-based angiography for all emergent cases presenting with rupture,
Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality
of Evidence: B (Moderate), and electively for preoperative planning, Level of Recommendation: Grade 1
(Strong), Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
2.1: We recommend treatment of all gastric artery and
gastroepiploic artery aneurysms of any size. Level of
Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
3.1: We recommend endovascular embolization for ﬁrstline treatment of gastric artery and gastroepiploic artery
aneurysms. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
4.1: We suggest abdominal axial imaging to screen for
concomitant abdominal aneurysms. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B
(Moderate).
4.2: We suggest one-time screening CTA (or MRA) of the
