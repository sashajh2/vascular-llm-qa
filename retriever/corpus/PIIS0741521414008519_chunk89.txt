lapping during application. Every multicomponent
bandage is a multilayer bandage, whereas graduated
compression stockings have a single compression layer.
The four-layer bandage (4LB) is a multicomponent
bandage consisting of four components: orthopedic wool,
crepe bandage, elastic bandage, and elastic cohesive (outer)
bandage. Applying several components and layers over
each other not only increases the pressure but also changes
the elastic property of the ﬁnal bandage because of the friction between the surfaces of each bandage and a cohesive
outer layer, producing a ﬁnal multilayer bandage that is
less elastic and more stiff. Short-stretch bandages (SSB)
are also often used as multicomponent bandages in combination with different materials. Unfortunately, the different
combinations of materials are often poorly described in
trials.
Coexistence of multiple devices that are designed to
perform essentially the same function demonstrates that
although compression therapy is generally effective, the
optimization of compression has been a challenging task

A total of nine RCTs compare compression therapy to
no compression therapy, and these trials provide objective
information on initial ulcer size as well as the outcomes
of time to complete healing or proportion of ulcers healed
(FDA-recommended end points of wound therapy trials).
The preponderance of evidence suggests that VLUs heal
more quickly with compression therapy vs no compression
as conﬁrmed by our commissioned comparative systematic
review and meta-analysis of compression modalities and
venous ulcer healing.30
One RCT of 36 patients directly compared compressive (Unna boot) with noncompressive bandages (polyurethane foam dressing). Wound healing rates were
signiﬁcantly improved by 0.07 cm2/day (P ¼ .004), and
more patients completely healed in the compression group
(RR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.29-4.10).278,279
A recent Cochrane review identiﬁed three RCTs
encompassing a total of 177 patients comparing compression dressings with primary dressing alone (never with
compression).279 One study (44 patients) showed a difference with improved ulcer area and volume at 8 weeks.280
