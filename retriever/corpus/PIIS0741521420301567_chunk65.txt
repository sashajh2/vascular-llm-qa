ysms <5 cm among high-risk patients and
repair for lesions >2 cm only among low-risk patients
unless these aneurysms enlarge or become symptomatic. Given the signiﬁcant high rate of morbidity and
mortality after HAA rupture (30% mortality rate in one
series150) and overall low rate of morbidity and mortality
after elective HAA repair (0% mortality in the same series150), the current recommendation is for repair of aneurysms >2.0 cm in diameter in low-risk patients and
>5.0 cm among high-risk patients if open repair is
planned. In these patients, endovascular therapy with
stent or coil embolization of the HAA can be contemplated at the same size criteria as in low-risk patients,
provided there is adequate collateralization, given the

Both open and endovascular options exist for HAA
repair. All retrospective case series have shown that the
outcome for visceral artery aneurysms after open or
endovascular repair yielded similar long-term results,
but morbidity is signiﬁcantly worse with open repair
than with the endovascular approach.2,7 With the
improvement of endovascular techniques and relative
low morbidity associated with endovascular repair, endovascular techniques should be preferentially offered in
anatomically suitable candidates.
The majority of these aneurysms are extrahepatic (75%80%).150,153,159 Most are solitary aneurysms, with multiple
HAAs reported in only 8% of these series.150 The ideal
procedure of choice should allow the exclusion of aneurysm while maintaining the liver circulation, which can
be achieved by either resection of the aneurysm with
interposition graft or by placement of a stent graft and
endovascular exclusion of the aneurysm. Given the possibility of central liver necrosis despite adequate collateral
ﬂow by endovascular exclusion,93 in low-risk patients,
