or CAS.
b. Potential “high-risk groups” who might benefit from
screening for asymptomatic stenosis. Two studies have
identified specific groups among the general population
with a higher prevalence of significant carotid stenosis that
may ⬎30%. Jacobowitz et al35 developed a model identifying patients at high risk for ⬎50% asymptomatic carotid
stenosis. The screened patients were aged ⬎60 years and
had one or more of the following risk factors: history of
hypertension, CAD, current smoking, and a first-degree
family relative with a history of stroke. The prevalence of
carotid artery stenosis was only 2% if no risk factor was
present, 6% with one risk factor, which increased to 14% for
two risk factors, to 16% for three risk factors, and to 67% for
four risk factors.
Qureshi et al36 identified the following variables associated with ⱖ60% asymptomatic carotid stenosis: age ⬎65
years (odds ratio, 4.1), current smoking (odds ratio, 2),
CAD (odds ratio, 2.4), and hypercholesterolemia (odds
ratio, 1.9). Patients undergoing coronary revascularization
are another group with an increased prevalence of carotid
stenosis of 2% to 27%.37,38 Overall, the prevalence of
carotid artery stenosis among patients undergoing CABG is
higher than the general population. In patients with symptomatic CAD and other risk factors, such as age ⬎65 years,
history of stroke or TIA, left main coronary stenosis, diabetes mellitus, carotid bruit, peripheral arterial disease
(PAD), and previous carotid operation, it is feasible that a
subset of patients with
