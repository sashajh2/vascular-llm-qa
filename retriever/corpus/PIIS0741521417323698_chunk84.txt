 been reported to occur in up to 40% of patients
after unilateral HA embolization, these symptoms tend
to improve and abate over time.333 Indeed, one of the
largest series of patients undergoing HA interruption
during AAA repair revealed that persistent buttock
claudication developed in 12% of unilateral and 11% of
bilateral HA interruptions, whereas impotence occurred
in 9% of unilateral and 13% of bilateral HA embolizations.334 In addition, the occurrence of these events is
reduced if patency of the internal iliac artery bifurcation remains intact as illustrated in one small study
using an Amplatzer vascular plug (St. Jude Medical, St.
Paul, Minn) to occlude only the main trunk of the
HA.335 A more recent report demonstrated no clinical
difference between coils and plug embolization.336
Despite concerns about prolonged procedural time
and increased amount of contrast material, concomitant unilateral HA embolization during EVAR has been

shown to be safe and effective compared with a
staged approach.337
Bilateral HA occlusion with endograft extension into
both external iliac arteries is occasionally required in
high-risk patients when there is no distal ﬁxation zone
in either common iliac artery or the aneurysm involves
both common and internal iliac arteries. Although antegrade ﬂow into at least one HA should be maintained, if
possible, bilateral HA embolization may be necessary in
some situations. Initial concerns about life-threatening
pelvic or colonic ischemia and neurologic deﬁcits after
bilateral HA interruption during EVAR may have been
overestimated as several recent reports have suggested
that such devastating complications are exceedingly
rare.329,338-340 The risks associated with bilateral HA occlusion are restricted to more severe, persistent, and
frequent
buttock
claudication
and
erectile
dysfunction.341
Technical considerations that may reduce the incidence of adverse events when bilateral HA embolization
is required include a staged approach, embolization of
only the proximal main trunk of the HA, and preservation
of collateral branches from the common and deep
femoral arteries.3
