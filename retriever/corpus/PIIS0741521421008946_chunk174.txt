 P ¼ .069) for
vascular surgeons vs cardiothoracic surgeons and general surgeons, 0.3 for high-volume surgeons vs low-/medium-volume surgeons (95% CI, 0.1-0.7; P ¼ .008), and
0.2 (95% CI, 0.06-0.45; P ¼ .0004) when patching was
used. A multivariate analysis showed that the OR of having a perioperative stroke for low-volume surgeons (vs
high-volume) was 3.4 (95% CI, 0.96-11.8; P ¼ .0581). The authors concluded that high-volume surgeons had signiﬁcantly better perioperative stroke/death rate for CEA
than low-/medium-volume surgeons. The perioperative
stroke/death rate were also higher for nonvascular surgeons in asymptomatic patients.572
Recently, Meltzer et al573 analyzed the impact of provider characteristics on outcomes of CEA for asymptomatic carotid stenosis in New York State. In this study,
36,495 patients underwent CEA for asymptomatic disease performed by vascular surgeons (76%), general surgeons (16%), cardiac surgeons (6%), and neurosurgeons
(2%). Unadjusted outcomes improved with increasing
surgeon annual CEA volume. Patients of mid-career surgeons had lower stroke and mortality risk than those of
early or late-career surgeons. The odds of mortality
were increased when surgery was performed by the
lowest volume providers (quintile 1, 0-11 CEA/year; OR,
2.61; 95% CI, 1.3-5.3) or a nonspecialty trained general surgeon (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.0-2.7). After adjustment for all
patient-level factors, provider volume remained an independent predictor of outcome, with signiﬁcantly
increased odds of mortality for volume quintile 1 (OR,
2.6; 95% CI, 1.3-5.2) and quintile 2 (12-22 CEA/year) (OR,
2.1; 95% CI,
