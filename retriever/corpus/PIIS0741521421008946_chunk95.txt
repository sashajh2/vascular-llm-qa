complications (neck hematoma 4.2% for eversion vs 5.5%
for CCEA; CNI 3.8% for eversion vs 5.6% for CCEA). Additionally, no differences were noted in restenosis at followup ranging from 1 to 69 months nor did stroke risk during
follow-up differ between groups (2% vs 2.4%). A metaanalysis of randomized trials also reported that ECEA
was associated with signiﬁcantly higher incidence of
post-CEA hypertension (OR, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.82-4.16),
compared with CCEA. However, CCEA was associated
with signiﬁcantly higher incidence of perioperative hypotension (OR, 11.37; 95% CI, 1.95-66.46)323 (Table V).
Carotid artery bypass. If the distal end point cannot be
assessed adequately or is incomplete, a transverse incision in the ICA can be chosen for completion of the eversion endarterectomy to evaluate the rest of the end point
and also to tack down the distal intima.318 Alternatively, if
the disease extends or the end point is not well tacked
down, a more commonly used approach is to transect
the ICA distally and perform a common carotid to ICA
bypass. This can be done in numerous ways.324-329 The
most common technique calls for transection of the ICA
at the distal end point and an anastomosis performed
with greater saphenous vein or appropriately sized
prosthetic, usually 6 mm. By performing a distal ﬁrst, the
length of the bypass can be judged so there is no kinking.
One option is to close the arteriotomy on the CCA preserving the external carotid artery into and end
