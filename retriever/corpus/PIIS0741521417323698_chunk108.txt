Based on review of the literature, including existing
guidelines endorsed in the United Kingdom447 and by
the Western Vascular Society, an algorithm for the initial
evaluation, diagnosis, immediate management, and
triage of patients with a suspected ruptured AAA is presented (Fig 5). An expedited evaluation consisting of the
airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) protocol, general
assessment, and vital sign check should be initially
performed by the emergency physician of any patient
suspected of having a ruptured AAA. Diagnosis in the
emergency department is usually ascertained on the
basis of history and physical examination. Radiologic
conﬁrmation, either by bedside ultrasound imaging or
a contrast-enhanced CT scan, can be obtained when
an alternative diagnosis is more likely on clinical grounds.
Optimization of the patient’s clinical condition in the
preoperative setting, while waiting for urgent transport
to an operating room, may improve outcomes. Intravenous access should be established with two large-bore
peripheral intravenous lines as central or arterial access
is not immediately necessary. Permissive hypotension,
or hypotensive hemostasis, which refers to restricting

aggressive ﬂuid resuscitation as long as the patient
remains conscious and has a systolic blood pressure
between 70 and 90 mm Hg, should be implemented
to limit excessive hemorrhage.448-450 Laboratory or imaging studies should be obtained only to conﬁrm the diagnosis of ruptured AAA. Other actions that may help
improve outcomes are the immediate availability of
blood and blood products, warming, and avoidance of
elective intubation.451
With the increasing use of endovascular methods to
treat patients presenting with a ruptured AAA, vital
resources, including advanced imaging, trained staff,
and robust endovascular inventory, must be available.
In cases in which transfer is not necessary, the vascular
team should be notiﬁed as soon as a ruptured AAA is
suspected. It may be prudent, however, to transfer a
patient to a higher level facility when such resources
are unavailable.452,453 Patients with good functional status and without severe comorbidity should
