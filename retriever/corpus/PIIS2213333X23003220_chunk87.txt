AASV, Anterior accessory saphenous vein; DVT, Deep vein thrombosis; EVLA, endovenous laser ablation; EHIT, endovenous heat-induced thrombosis;
HL, high ligation; HL&S, high ligation and stripping; GSV, great saphenous vein; QOL, quality of life; RFA, radiofrequency ablation; SSV, small saphenous
vein; VCSS, Venous Clinical Severity Score.

30.8% of the stripping group vs 95.3% in the RFA
group.165 Postoperative pain was associated with
increased BMI and large vein diameter. For large
diameter veins, RFA was superior to stripping. These
data support that thermal ablation techniques are safe
and effective in treating large diameter saphenous
veins. There have been no large case series using
nonthermal techniques in large veins.
