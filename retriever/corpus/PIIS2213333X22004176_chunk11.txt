Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak), quality of evidence: C (low to very low)

GUIDELINE 4.
4.1.1. For patients with varicose veins (CEAP class C2) who
have signiﬁcant, symptomatic axial reﬂux of the great
or small saphenous vein, we recommend against
treatment of incompetent perforating veins
concomitant with initial ablation of the superﬁcial
truncal veins.
Level of recommendation: grade 1 (strong), quality of evidence: C (low to very low)
4.1.2. For patients with varicose veins (CEAP class C2) who
have signiﬁcant, symptomatic axial reﬂux of the
anterior accessory or posterior accessory great
saphenous vein, we suggest against treatment of
incompetent perforating veins concomitant with
initial ablation of the superﬁcial truncal veins.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak), quality of evidence: C (low to very low)
4.2. For patients with varicose veins (CEAP class C2) and
persistent or recurrent symptoms after previous
complete ablation of incompetent superﬁcial truncal veins, we suggest treatment of perforating vein
incompetence if it is the origin of the symptomatic
varicose tributaries.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak), quality of evidence: C (low to very low)

GUIDELINE 5.
5.1.1. For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the great or
small saphenous vein and associated varicosities, we
recommend ablation of the reﬂuxing venous trunk
and concomitant phlebectomy or ultrasoundguided foam sclerotherapy of the varicosities with
physician-compounded foam or commercial polidocanol endovenous microfoam.
Level of recommendation: grade 1 (strong); quality of evidence: C (low to very low)
5.1.2. For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the anterior
accessory or posterior accessory great saphenous
vein, we suggest ablation of the reﬂuxing venous
trunk
and
concomitant
phlebectomy
or
ultrasound-guided
