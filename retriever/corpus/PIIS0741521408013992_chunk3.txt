 with progressive kidney
disease, identification and protection of potential native
access construction sites by members of the health care
team and patients, and the development of a multifaceted
quality assurance program to detect at-risk vascular access,
track complication rates, and implement procedures that
maximize access longevity.

The original guidelines recommended that autogenous
AV access be constructed in at least 50% of all new renal
failure patients electing to receive hemodialysis as their
initial form of renal replacement therapy, with the expectation that ultimately, 40% of prevalent patients would be
receiving their hemodialysis through an autogenous AV
access.11 The 2006 updated KDOQI Guidelines raised this
benchmark for minimal use of autogenous access in prevalent hemodialysis patients to 65%.9
In June 2003, a coalition consisting of the CMS, the
End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Networks, the Institute
for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), and other key provider
representatives jointly recommended adoption of a National Vascular Access Improvement Initiative (NVAII).
The initial goal of this initiative was to increase the number
of autogenous AV accesses placed and functioning in suitable patients to meet or even surpass the targets set by
NKF-KDOQI guidelines.
The NVAII was originally intended to run through
2003; but because of early success in reaching the thenKDOQI goal of 40% prevalence by August 2005, CMS
formally expanded its commitment by upgrading the initiative to what CMS called the AV Fistula First Breakthrough
Initiative (FFBI), with a new goal of 66% by 2009.10 The
FFBI Work Group identified clinical and organizational
changes that could be adapted and applied locally by nephrologists, dialysis personnel, access surgeons, and patients
to increase the production and use of autogenous AV
access. They also identified system changes that could be
implemented at a national level to encourage the placement
of autogenous AV accesses at a higher rate than prosthetic
AV accesses and catheters, for example, reimbursement for
preoperative vessel mapping to identify adequate vessels for
use for autogenous access construction. As a result of
