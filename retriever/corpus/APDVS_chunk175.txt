 They measure the total exposure accumulated over a set period of time. It’s important to note that these devices specifically
measure ionizing radiation and not other forms.
There are several types of badges available. Film badges are commonly used in clinical practice.
They are worn by a single person and are evaluated every 30 days. Other types of badges
provide real-time quantification of radiation exposure, with readings recorded at the beginning
and end of each shift. A radiation oﬀcer is typically tasked with tracking these exposure
levels.

When an individual’s exposure approaches a certain threshold, which is typically set below
the maximum allowable dose for a year, measures are taken to further minimize their exposure. For instance, if an employee has reached a significant exposure level two months into the
year, the radiation compliance oﬀcer would discuss strategies to reduce their exposure. Strategies include maintaining greater distance from radiation sources, rotating through cases more
frequently, and avoiding involvement in procedures with a higher risk of elevated radiation
levels.
If an employee surpasses their annual exposure limits, they are typically prohibited from
participating in procedures involving radiation for the remainder of the year. The specific
limits of exposure are detailed later in the chapter.

Lead Glasses and Eye Protection
In the endovascular suite, it’s common to see individuals wearing leaded glasses. A 2016 study
compared different types of glasses and their effectiveness in reducing radiation exposure. The
results showed that all leaded glasses outperformed non-leaded safety glasses, with an average
reduction in dose of approximately 90.3%. (Waddell et al. 2016) This study is just one of
many that highlight the eﬀcacy of lead glasses in minimizing eye exposure during procedures
involving radiation.
Despite the significant reduction achieved with the use of lead safety glasses, there’s a caveat
regarding a false sense of security. Due to the scattering of radiation during procedures, the
eye can be exposed to radiation at oblique angles (i.e. around the glasses), leading to increased
exposure and limited reduction in dose. (Kirkwood et al. 2020) In such scenarios, the optimal
solution for reducing eye exposure would be a full visor or face shield with lateral eye
shielding. A study by Sam
