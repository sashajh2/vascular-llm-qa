and 3).
7.2.4. There is no clinical evidence that FS using room
air is less safe and effective than using CO2 gas
mixture.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Many studies show the beneﬁt of FS for
treatment of superﬁcial venous disease, with minimal
side effects. While in theory felt to be safer, there is
limited data that directly compares the use of CO2 or
CO2/O2-based foam to room air when treating with
foam sclerosants.
Evidence. UGFS has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of superﬁcial venous disease, and
it is currently recommended for treatment of reticular
and varicose veins, in addition of superﬁcial truncal veins.

In a comprehensive review of the literature Cartee
et al,199 discussed factors affecting foam stability and
found that the half-life of room air foam was reported to
be three times longer than that of CO2 alone and 1.5
times longer than O2/CO2.200,201
Morrison et al202 showed that bubbles were detected in
the right heart in all patients after room air FS and highintensity transient signals were seen in the middle cerebral artery in 4 of 21 patients. Morrison et al203 looked at
side effects using air and CO2 foam for endovenous
chemical ablation and found
