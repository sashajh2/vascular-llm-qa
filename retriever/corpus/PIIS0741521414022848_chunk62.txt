 We
recommend that the modality used should either achieve concomitant aneurysm exclusion or
should not jeopardize the conduct of any future open or endovascular aneurysm repair.
In all patients undergoing revascularization for AIOD, we recommend assessing the CFA. If
hemodynamically signiﬁcant CFA disease is present, we recommend surgical therapy
(endarterectomy) as ﬁrst-line treatment.
In patients with iliac artery disease and involvement of the CFA, we recommend hybrid
procedures combining femoral endarterectomy with iliac inﬂow correction.
We recommend direct surgical reconstruction (bypass, endarterectomy) in patients with
reasonable surgical risk and diffuse AIOD not amenable to an endovascular approach, after
one or more failed attempts at EVT, or in patients with combined occlusive and aneurysmal
disease.
In younger patients (age <50 years) with IC, we recommend a shared decision-making
approach to engage patients and inform them of the possibility of inferior outcomes with
either endovascular or surgical interventions.
We recommend either axial imaging (eg, CT, MR) or catheter-based angiography for evaluation
and planning of surgical revascularization for AIOD.
When performing surgical bypass for aortoiliac disease, concomitant aneurysmal disease of the
aorta or iliac arteries should be treated as appropriate (exclusion) and is a contraindication to
end-to-side proximal anastomoses.
For any bypass graft originating from the CFA, the donor iliac artery must be free of
hemodynamically signiﬁcant disease or any pre-existing disease should be corrected before
performing the bypass graft.
