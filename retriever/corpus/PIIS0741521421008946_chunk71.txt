 with patients undergoing CEA with general anesthesia, the 6684 (9%) CEA
cases of 75,319 that were were performed under local
anesthesia/regional anesthesia were more likely to have
a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists class
(class 3-5, 94% vs 93%) and more likely to be older (median age, 72 years vs 71 years) (all P < .001). CEA with general anesthesia had higher crude rates of in-hospital
cardiac events including arrhythmia (1.6% vs 1.2%; P <
.001), hemodynamic instability (27% vs 20%; P < .001),
MI (0.5% vs 0.2%; P ¼ .01), and acute congestive heart failure (0.5% vs 0.2%; P < .001) compared with CEA with
local or regional anesthesia. However, there was no difference in perioperative death or stroke between the two
groups. CEA with general anesthesia was associated
with four times the odds of acute CHF (OR, 3.92; 95%
CI, 1.84-8.34; P < .001), 1.5 times the odds of hemodynamic instability (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.44-1.66; P < .001),
and twice the odds of in-hospital MI (OR, 1.95; 95% CI,
1.06-3.59; P ¼ .03). Patients who underwent CEA with
general anesthesia had 1.8 times the odds of staying in
the hospital for more than 1 day (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.671.93; P < .001). These authors noted that differences
were clinically irrelevant, because the overall risk of cardiac adverse events after CEA was low. Others felt that
the approach to choosing anesthesia for CEA should be
based on patient risk factors and preference, and by
the team’s experience.239-241
