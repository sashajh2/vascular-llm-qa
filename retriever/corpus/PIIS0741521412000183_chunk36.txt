 provided. Factors
associated with stent thrombosis have included thrombophilia and evidence of extrinsic compression.92
6.2. We recommend that all patients be treated
with knee-high compression stockings (30 to 40 mm
Hg) for at least 2 years after the procedure (Grade
1C). The role of compression stockings in the management of chronic venous disorders has been well established.93 Compression stockings improve calf muscle pump
function, reduce edema, and likely improve cutaneous microcirculation.94-98 The use of graded elastic compression
stockings decreases by 50% the incidence of objectively
defined postthrombotic syndrome after a first episode of
“proximal” DVT treated with conventional anticoagulation.
In a randomized trial of 194 patients, the incidence of mildto-moderate and severe postthrombotic syndrome was 20%
and 11%, respectively, among patients receiving compression
stockings compared with 47% and 23% among those in the
control group.99 Prandoni et al100 similarly found the use of
compression stockings (30 to 40 mm Hg at the ankle) reduced the 2-year incidence of any post-thrombotic syndrome
from 49.1% to 24.5%. Among those treated with optimal
anticoagulation, 4.3 patients need to wear compression stockings to prevent one case of post-thrombotic syndrome.
On the basis of these data, current guidelines recommend the prescription of graded elastic compression stock-

ings (40 mm Hg at the ankle) for at least 2 years after a
proximal thrombotic event treated with conventional anticoagulation (Grade 1A).24 Although early thrombus removal strategies likely also reduce the incidence of the
postthrombotic syndrome, no reports have evaluated the
adjunctive effect of compression stockings in this patient
population. The evidence supporting the use of compression stockings among patients treated with early thrombus
removal strategies is indirect, but the potential benefits
likely exceed the risks, and their use can be strongly recommended (Grade 1C).
