177 In a
prospective cohort study, Mackenzie et al193 monitored
102 consecutive patients who underwent varicose vein
surgery. At 2 years after surgery, health-related QOL markedly improved to baseline when assessed with the Aberdeen

Gloviczki et al 23S

Varicose Vein Symptom Severity Score and the SF-36.
Improvement in QOL from varicose vein surgery has been
shown to be statistically significant and clinically meaningful, matching the benefits observed after elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.194
Recovery after conventional high ligation and inversion
stripping with associated phlebectomies has been variable
in different reports. In a series of 112 procedures performed
in an office setting under locoregional anesthesia, using
high ligation, PIN stripping, and hook phlebectomy, Goren and Yellin169 reported that all their patients resumed
normal daily and sporting activities immediately after surgery and none had major complications. There was frequent bruising, but no tract hematomas, no nerve damage,
and no DVTs were noted in this series. Follow-up of this
series, however, was poor and the quality of evidence of
treatment efficacy was low.
In an RCT that compared high ligation, stripping, and
phlebectomy with RFA and phlebectomy, the open surgical
group at 3 weeks had a 2.8% wound infection rate, 19.4% of
the patients had ecchymosis, 33.3% had hematoma, and
5.6% had paresthesias.195 Most importantly, time to return
to normal activities averaged 3.89 days (95% CI, 2.67-5.12
days; P â«½ .02), only 46.9% of patients returned to routine
daily activities within 1 day, and the number of days to
return to work averaged 12.4 days (95% CI, 8.66-16.23
days).
HL/S vs high ligation alone. HL/S of the GSV reduced the risk of reoperation by two-thirds at 5 years after
surgery in a prospective randomized study reported by
