 interventions in patients with 50% to 99% stenosis
and a history of stroke or TIA in the preceding 6 months
who require CABG is supported by the reported
data.128-133 However, the optimal timing for these interventions is unclear. In patients with severe (>70%) stenosis and symptomatic disease, minimal studies have
addressed the timing of the interventions.134 In an analysis of multiple observational studies, patients undergoing combined CABG and CEA compared with CABG
ﬁrst had a similar risk of death (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.321.05), stroke (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.34-2.22), and MI (RR,
0.64; 95% CI, 0.09-4.34).14 When comparing CABG ﬁrst
vs CEA ﬁrst, the groups had a similar risk of death (RR,
0.94; 95% CI, 0.44-2.01), stroke (RR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.643.06), and MI (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.22-1.18). Finally, if the
CABG ﬁrst group were compared with the CEA ﬁrst
group, the risks of death, stroke, and MI were also similar.
As expected, a small trend was found toward a greater
risk of MI if CEA were performed ﬁrst and an increased
trend toward a risk of stroke if CABG were performed
ﬁrst; however, these differences were not signiﬁcant.
One of the most controversial issues is the role of prophylactic CEA and/or CAS in CABG patients with unilateral 70% to 99% asymptomatic stenosis, for whom the
stroke risk might be <2%.135,136 Two RCTs and several
observational series compared combined CEA and
CABG with a strategy of CABG ﬁrst and delayed CEA in
patients with unilateral asymptomatic carotid stenosis.13
