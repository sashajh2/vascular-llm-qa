axis after injection of a sclerosing solution can occur, and it is
essential to have an emergency protocol, resuscitation
equipment, oxygen, and drugs (diphenhydramine, epinephrine, cimetidine, steroids) available to prevent a
major catastrophe.
Guex et al296 reported early and midterm complications in a prospective multicenter registry that included
12,173 sclerotherapy sessions, consisting of 5434 with
liquid, 6395 with foam, and 344 using both. Ultrasonographic guidance was used in 4088 sessions (33.9%), and
49 incidents or accidents (0.4%) occurred, of which 12
were with liquid and 37 with foam. There were 20 cases of
visual disturbances, in 19 cases, foam or air block was used;
all resolved shortly, without any after effects. A femoral vein
thrombosis was the only severe adverse event in this study,
which also demonstrated that sclerotherapy is a safe
technique.
A systematic review of foam sclerotherapy also found a
low rate of major complications.10 In ⬎9000 patients
studied, the median rates of serious adverse events, including PE and DVT, were rare, ⬍1%. The median rate of visual
disturbance was 1.4%, headache occurred in 4.2%, thrombophlebitis in 4.7%, matting, skin staining, or pigmentation
in 17.8%, and pain at the site of injection in 25.6%.
Morrison et al327 evaluated the safety of carbon dioxide
in patients undergoing 1% polidocanol foam sclerotherapy
and compared them with a historical control of patients
who had air mixed with the sclerosing agent. The carbon
dioxide– based foam group had 128 patients (115 women
and 13 men). Visual disturbances were experienced by 3.1%
(4 of 128) of the carbon dioxide group and in 8.2% (4 of
49) of the air group (P ⫽ .15). The incidence of chest
tightness (3.1% vs 1
