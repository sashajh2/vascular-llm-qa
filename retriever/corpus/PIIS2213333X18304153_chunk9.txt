One major problem with compression therapy is poor
adherence by the patient, especially when long-term
management is planned.18 The main complaints reported by patients are difﬁculties during the process of
donning (pulling up) and dofﬁng (removing) compression stockings, problems with slipping of ﬁxed bandages
down the leg, and concerns with hygiene because these
must be worn for prolonged periods. The pain relief and
other beneﬁts experienced by patients when the devices
accomplish proper compression is the best argument for
improved compliance.

1. COMPRESSION VS NO COMPRESSION AFTER
THERMAL ABLATION OR STRIPPING OF THE
SAPHENOUS VEINS
Guideline 1.1: Compression after thermal ablation or
stripping of the saphenous veins.
When possible, compression (elastic stockings or wraps)
should be used after surgical or thermal procedures to
eliminate varicose veins. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 1.2: Dose of compression after thermal ablation or
stripping of the saphenous veins.
If compression dressings are to be used postprocedurally in
patients undergoing ablation or surgical procedures on
the saphenous veins, those providing pressures >20 mm
Hg together with eccentric pads placed directly over the
vein ablated or operated on provide the greatest
reduction in postoperative pain. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE - B]

A total of 13 relevant publications were identiﬁed,12,13,19-29
of which 1 was a systematic review19 and 2 were guidelines
produced by other groups.20,21 The remaining 10 manuscripts included 9 randomized controlled trials
(RCTs)12,13,22-27,29 and one case-control study.28
Neither the RCTs12,13,22-27,29 nor the case-control
study28 included a group of patients that did not
receive compression therapy. Most practitioners
routinely recommend compression therapy after surgical or thermal ablation of varicose veins, with the tacit
assumption that patients will derive beneﬁt from

compression. In the published studies
