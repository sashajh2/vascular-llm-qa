Evidence. An RCT293 demonstrated improvement of
plethysmographic measurements after 6-month treatment. However, comparison vs placebo in another 3month trial294 failed to show a signiﬁcant difference for
edema, symptoms of CVD, and QOL, with exception of
QOL at 12-month follow-up, better in calcium dobesilate
group. A more recent trial with calcium dobesilate vs
MPFF295 reported similar and signiﬁcant pain reduction
in both groups. In an RCT vs placebo in patients with
CEAP C3-4,296 calcium dobesilate signiﬁcantly decreased
leg volume (P ¼ .0002) and improved symptoms
(discomfort, heavy legs, tired legs, tingling, itching and
cramps (P < .05).297
A meta-analysis performed in 200418 found 10 RCTs
(778 patients) comparing calcium dobesilate with placebo for CVI. The methodological quality was good in 3
RCTs (608 patients). Calcium dobesilate decreased night
cramps and discomfort more than placebo with number
of patients needed to be treated of 4 (95% CI, 3-7) vs 8

(95% CI, 4-50). Greater improvement was reported in severe CVD as compared with the mild disease, for leg volume decrease, pain, heaviness, malleolar swelling, and
paresthesia. Interestingly, no dose effect was noticed:
1000 mg was as effective as 1500 mg/d. A meta-analysis15
found calcium dobesilate effectiveness comparable to
Ruscus extracts in reducing foot volume and ankle circumferences. Data from a postmarketing surveillance
report 1974 to 1998, the international literature (19702003) and periodic safety update report 1995 to
