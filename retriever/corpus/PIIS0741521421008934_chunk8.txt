osis identiﬁed using noninvasive vascular studies, CEA assumed a primarily prophylactic role for prevention of major stroke in
asymptomatic patients and those with evidence of transient cerebral or ocular ischemia. Large prospective, randomized trials have established the role and efﬁcacy of
CEA in stroke prevention.2-6
During the past two decades, carotid artery stenting
(CAS) has also evolved as a catheter-based alternative
to CEA and medical therapy for stroke prevention and
treatment. Approximately 135,000 interventions on lesions in the carotid bifurcation are performed annually
in the United States. It has been reported that 90% are
performed for patients without neurologic symptoms
and that 11% are catheter-based procedures performed
by a variety of specialists, including vascular surgeons,
general surgeons, neurosurgeons, cardiologists, thoracic
surgeons, interventional radiologists, and interventional
neurologists.7 However, others believe that the best

data we have regarding symptom status come from
the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) and National Surgical
Quality Improvement Program, with the proportion
closer to 60% to 70%.8 Also, although these data might
not be generalizable to the entire U.S. population, they
are far better than the Nationwide Inpatient Sample
data.8
Because multiple options can be available for the treatment of a single disease entity, deﬁning the optimal therapy can be challenging, especially, when multiple
specialties, often with nonoverlapping expertise, are
involved in these treatment options. Thus, extensive and
often conﬂicting literature has developed around the current standard for the diagnosis and management of
extracranial carotid disease. Four large, prospective, randomized trials have been reported comparing the efﬁcacy
of CEA and CAS in the management of extracranial carotid stenosis.9-12 A meta-analysis comparing CAS and
CEA, which included some of these trials, was published
in the Journal of Vascular Surgery.13 Another recent
meta-analysis conducted by the Mayo Clinic Evidence
Practice Center and comparing CAS and CEA for symptomatic standard surgical risk patients also will be reported in the Journal of Vascular Surgery.14
