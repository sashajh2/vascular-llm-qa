 the superior border of the carotid triangle. It is often
visualized in patients with high carotid bifurcations.The scalene muscles are deep to the
sternocleidomastoid muscles and lateral to the cervical spine. They are not manipulated
in a CEA.
2. What structure is not found in the carotid sheath?
A. Internal jugular vein
B. External jugular vein
C. Common carotid artery
D. Vagus nerve
Answer
B. External jugular vein
Discussion: The external jugular vein is not in the carotid sheath. It runs superficial to
and obliquely across the sternocleidomastoid before passing to the posterior border of
the sternocleidomastoid as it descends deep into the neck. The carotid sheath contains
the common carotid artery anteromedially, the internal jugular vein anterolaterally, and
the vagus nerve posteriorly.
3. In what order do you unclamp the carotid vessels at the end of a carotid endarterectomy?
A. External carotid artery → common carotid artery → internal carotid artery
B. Common carotid artery → internal carotid artery → external carotid artery
C. Internal carotid artery → external carotid artery → common carotid artery
D. Internal carotid artery → common carotid artery → external carotid artery
Answer
A. External carotid artery → common carotid artery → internal carotid
artery
Discussion: In conventional CEA, the internal carotid artery (ICA), the common carotid
artery (CCA), and the external carotid artery (ECA) are clamped in that order such that
any atherosclerotic debris loosened during vessel manipulation and/or clamping embolizes
into the ECA where it could cause extracranial ischemia rather than the ICA where it
could cause intracranial ischemia (i.e. ischemic stroke). A useful mnemonic to remember

52

the clamping order is ICE for ICA, CCA, and ECA. The order when unclamping is the
opposite, ECI. The rational is similar. By unclamping the
