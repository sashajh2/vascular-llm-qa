cacy of two liquid sclerosants, polidocanol and STS, and
both were used to treat varicose and telangiectatic veins. All
patients had an average of 70% improvement, and 70% to
72% were satisfied in all vein categories treated with either
solution.
Liquid sclerotherapy does poorly for treatment of the
incompetent GSV, but results of foam sclerotherapy are
much more encouraging. Rabe et al331 performed a multicenter RCT to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GSV
sclerotherapy using standardized polidocanol foam. The
3% foam was more efficient than and equally as safe as the
3% liquid for the treatment of the incompetent GSV.
In a prospective comparative study, Yamaki et al332
compared results of duplex-guided foam sclerotherapy and
duplex-guided liquid sclerotherapy in 77 patients. Duplex
scanning at 1 year demonstrated complete occlusion in the
GSV for duplex-guided foam sclerotherapy in 25 limbs
(67.6%), which was a significantly higher rate than that for
duplex-guided liquid sclerotherapy in 7 limbs (17.5%; P ⬍
.0001). Recurrent varicose veins were found in 3 patients
(8.1%) in the duplex-guided foam sclerotherapy group and
in 10 (25%) in the duplex-guided liquid sclerotherapy
group at 1 year (P ⫽ .048). Cabrera et al333 reported an
80% occlusion rate at 4 to 6 years when they used microfoam to treat incompetent GSV in 415 limbs.
In 808 patients with 1411 affected limbs, Coleridge
Smith306 used 1% polidocanol, 1% STS, and 3% STS in the
form of foam to treat incompetent saphenous trunks, and
459 limbs were available for duplex imaging at a follow-up
