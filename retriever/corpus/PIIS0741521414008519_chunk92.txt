 vs 46%; RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.270.76; P ¼ .003).289,290 A second RCT of 188 patients randomized 166 into two treatment groups, each receiving
therapy with 23 mm Hg compression at the ankle with
two brands of stockings. Compliance data reported from
this trial as summarized in Nelson and Bell-Syer demonstrated that inability to tolerate compression therapy was
signiﬁcantly associated with recurrent ulceration (RR,
2.58; 95% CI, 1.33-5.01; P ¼ .010), although these patients were not included in randomization.289,291
These RCT data are congruent with 15 years of observational data demonstrating that lack of compliance with
compression therapy was signiﬁcantly associated with ulcer
recurrence (16% recurrence with compliance, 100%
without; P < .0001).292 Two studies to date have evaluated the use of moderate (UK class II, 18-24 mm Hg at
the ankle) to high (UK class III, 25-35 mm Hg) compression and compliance with these stockings on prevention of
ulcer recurrence, with differing results. One study found no
difference in recurrence between the two groups but significantly lower compliance in the high-compression
group.293 Because time to recurrence was not reported,
the effect of compression pressures on delay of recurrence
remains unknown.

On the basis of our commissioned comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of compression modalities
and venous ulcer healing, low-quality evidence supports
the effect of compression on ulcer recurrence.30
Guideline 5.3: Multicomponent Compression
Bandage
We suggest the use of multicomponent compression bandage over single-component bandages for the
treatment of venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL
OF EVIDENCE - B]
The possible difference in healing outcomes between
single-layer and multilayer compression bandages has
been evaluated in four trials, three of which have been published. In two trials, the number of
