 Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs): When cells are deprived of oxygen (as in the case
of PAD), they activate hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). HIFs are transcription factors
such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF).
These factors promote the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis (the formation
of new blood vessels) and arteriogenesis (the remodeling and enlargement of existing
collateral vessels) through the stimulation of endothelial cells. Endothelial cells line
blood vessels and play a central role in angiogenesis. They respond to these growth
factors enabling endothelial cell proliferation and migration, which are essential for the
formation of new capillaries in the direction of the hypoxic tissue.
 Vasodilation: When blood vessels are exposed to reduced oxygen levels, they often
dilate in an attempt to increase blood fow. This vasodilation can help mobilize and
enhance the development of collateral vessels.
 Angiogenesis and Arteriogenesis: Angiogenesis involves the formation of small capillaries, while arteriogenesis involves the enlargement and maturation of existing collateral
vessels into larger arteries. These processes are driven by growth factors and signaling molecules like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor
(FGF), and various cytokines. As stated previously, they promote the proliferation and
migration of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, leading to the formation of new
blood vessels and the remodeling of existing ones.

 Shear Stress: As blood fows through collateral vessels, it exerts shear stress on the
vessel walls. Shear stress is a mechanical force that can trigger the release of molecules
like nitric oxide, which further stimulates vessel growth and remodeling.
 Physical Activity: Exercise and physical activity can also stimulate collateralization
by increasing shear stress on the vessel walls, enhancing collateral vessel growth. Furthermore, physical activity increases oxygen demand of the active tissues creating a
relative hypoxic environment, leading to collateralization/angiogenesis/arteriogenesis as
described above. This is why dedicated exercise is an important aspect of treatment for
claudication.
The development of collateral circulation in PAD is a gradual process that occurs over time
in response to the chronic reduction in blood fow. While collateralization can help improve
perfusion
