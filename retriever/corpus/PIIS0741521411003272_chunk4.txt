1. Clinical examination
For clinical examination of the lower limbs for chronic venous
disease, we recommend inspection (telangiectasia, varicosity,
edema, skin discoloration, corona phlebectatica,
lipodermatosclerosis, ulcer), palpation (cord, varicosity, tenderness,
induration, reflux, pulses, thrill, groin or abdominal masses),
auscultation (bruit), and examination of ankle mobility. Patients
should be asked for symptoms of chronic venous disease, which
may include tingling, aching, burning, pain, muscle cramps,
swelling, sensations of throbbing or heaviness, itching skin, restless
legs, leg tiredness, and fatigue.
2. Duplex scanning
We recommend that in patients with chronic venous disease, a
complete history and detailed physical examination are
complemented by duplex scanning of the deep and superficial
veins. The test is safe, noninvasive, cost-effective, and reliable.
We recommend that the four components of a complete duplex
scanning examination for chronic venous disease should be
visualization, compressibility, venous flow, including measurement
of duration of reflux, and augmentation.
We recommend that reflux to confirm valvular incompetence in the
upright position of the patients be elicited in one of two ways:
either with increased intra-abdominal pressure using a Valsalva
maneuver to assess the common femoral vein
