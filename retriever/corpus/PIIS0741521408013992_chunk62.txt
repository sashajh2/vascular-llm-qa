 is
identified through an extension of this incision or, if located
far away, through a second incision overlying the palpable
brachial artery pulse just beyond to the proximal radial artery.
The cephalic vein is tunneled superficially and medially towards the brachial artery to perform the anastomosis.
Autogenous brachial (or proximal radial)– basilic upper
arm transposition. This autogenous access is performed
between the end of the basilic vein and the brachial artery
located at or just proximal to the antecubital fossa, or the
proximal radial artery just distal to the fossa. An appropriate
length of adequate basilic vein is completely mobilized
distal to the antecubital crease if possible. The artery is
identified in the distal portion of the incision or, if located
far away, through a second incision overlying the artery.
The basilic vein is tunneled superficially and laterally to the
artery to perform the anastomosis. It is of note that this
transposition as well as others can be performed by onestage or two-stage techniques. A two-stage technique can
be used when the vein to be transposed has a small caliber
(⬍4 mm), where simply anastomosing the end of the vein
to the artery would allow the vein to dilate before its
transposition in the second stage of the two-stage technique.121 Before the second stage is performed, DU study
of the vein can confirm its adequacy. The second stage is

Autogenous brachial (or proximal radial artery)–brachial
vein upper arm transposition. This autogenous access is performed between the end of the brachial vein and the
brachial artery located in the antecubital fossa. If there is
adequate vein available distally, use of the proximal radial
artery as inflow is another option. The brachial vein and
brachial artery are identified through a longitudinal
