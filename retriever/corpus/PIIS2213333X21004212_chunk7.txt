to stratify analysis)
Age, sex, CEAP class

Question 2: If a patient has varicose vein identiﬁed and has axial saphenous vein incompetence, is there a difference in outcome
related to symptoms, recovery, or recurrence if the vein is treated with surgical stripping vs any endovenous ablation technique?

Patient
Adults with
varicose veins
and GSV
incompetence
(C2-C6)

Intervention

Comparison

Surgical stripping

Endovenous ablation
by any technique

Outcomes
Primary e
Anatomic closure,
PASTE
Symptom improvement based on
scale (pain, edema,
QoL)
Secondary e
Cosmetic (pigmentation, recurrent
varicosity)
AEs,
Recurrent
incompetence

Early, mid-term:
$1 year and late:
>5 years, reduction
in pain; reduction
in edema;
improvement in
functional capacity; VCSS, Aberdeen, improvement in QoL;
avoidance of initial
venous skin ulceration and recurrent
ulceration;
improvement in
wound healing;
and avoidance of
repeat interventions and harms
from the interventions, superﬁcial
phlebitis, PASTE,
nerve injury
