(Table II).
8. Neurologically asymptomatic patients deemed high
risk for CEA, TCAR, and transfemoral CAS should be
considered for primary medical management. Intervention can be considered in these patients only
with evidence that perioperative morbidity and mortality is less than 3%. CAS should not be performed
in these patients except as part of an ongoing clinical
trial.
9. There are insufﬁcient data to recommend transfemoral CAS as primary therapy for neurologically
asymptomatic patients with 70% to 99% diameter
stenosis. Data from CREST, ACT, and the VQI suggest
that in properly selected asymptomatic patients,
CAS may be equivalent to CEA in the hands of experienced interventionalists. Operators and institutions
performing CAS must exhibit expertise sufﬁcient to
meet the previously established AHA guidelines for
treatment of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Speciﬁcally, the combined stroke and death
rate must be less than 3% to ensure beneﬁt for the
patient.

Design

Primary outcome was proportion of patients with stroke/MI/death between
randomization & 30 days after surgery.
Composite end point was 4.8% (general)
vs 4.5% (local).
