95-3.51).364 Outcomes after
AAA repair are related to experience. Whereas earlier
studies365,366 suggested that the minimum hospital
threshold for optimal outcomes is 8 to 10 EVAR cases per
year, a recent risk-adjusted analysis of 122,495 Medicare
patients undergoing elective EVAR between 2001 and
2008 observed that operative mortality is directly related
to medical center volume.367 The OR for elective perioperative mortality adjusted for the surgeonâ€™s volume
was lowest for centers that perform at least 30 EVAR
cases per year.
We suggest that elective EVAR be performed at centers with a
volume of at least 10 EVAR cases each year and a documented
perioperative mortality and conversion rate to OSR of 2%
or less.

randomized controlled trials, in a review of Medicare
patients, most major complications were lower with
EVAR, including pneumonia (3.8% vs 12.9%; P < .001),
acute renal failure (4.3% vs 11.3%; P < .001), MI (2.5% vs
5.2%; P < .001), and bowel ischemia (0.6% vs 2.1%;
P < .001). EVAR patients were also more likely to be
discharged to home rather than to a skilled nursing
facility (95% vs 83%; P < .001). The need to convert from
EVAR to open repair decreased over time (2.2% in 2001
to 0.3% in 2008). Median length of stay was 2 days after
EVAR compared with 7 days after open repair (P < .001).
