, Doppler examination (handheld)
Level 2: Noninvasive— duplex scan, plethysmography
Level 3: Invasive or complex evaluation— contrast venography, venous pressure measurements, IVUS, CT
venography, MR venography

The accuracy of the diagnosis increases with the addition of imaging and invasive testing. Recording the date
and method used to confirm the clinical impression can be
added in parentheses after the CEAP recording as follows:
Full form: C2,4a,5, S Ep As, p Pr2,3,18 (Level 2, Feb 8, 2010)
Basic form: C5, S EpAs pPr (Level 2; Feb 8, 2010)
The main purpose of using the CEAP classification in
patients with CVD is to distinguish primary venous disease
from congenital varicosity and, most importantly, from
secondary, post-thrombotic venous insufficiency.53 Evaluation and treatment of the three conditions are distinctly
different.
OUTCOME ASSESSMENT
Outcome assessment of therapy of varicose veins and
more advanced CVD includes standardized objective criteria that reflect patient symptoms, characteristic signs, and
objective measures of functional and disease-specific
QOL.104
Generic QOL instruments
Generic QOL measures allow comparison with population norms and other disease states and provide a measure

of any ill effects of treatment. Generic and disease-specific
QOL measures are usually complementary and should be
used together. Of the generic QOL instruments the Short
Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) has been used with
success for assessment of global well-being of patients with
varicose veins.105,106
Venous disease–specific QOL instruments
Disease-specific QOL measurements are sensitive to
the beneficial effects of treatment. Different diseasespecific, patient-generated QOL tools and patient-reported
outcomes (PROs) have been popular in venous disease
reporting.107,108 The most frequently used validated venous disease–specific instruments include the Venous Insufficiency Epidemiologic and Economic Study of Qualityof-Life (VEINES-QOL/Sym) questionnaire scale, the
Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIV
