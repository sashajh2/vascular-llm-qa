��rstline treatment of gastric artery and gastroepiploic artery
aneurysms. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
4.1: We suggest abdominal axial imaging to screen for
concomitant abdominal aneurysms. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B
(Moderate).
4.2: We suggest one-time screening CTA (or MRA) of the
head, neck, and chest for those patients with segmental
arterial mediolysis. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2
(Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
5.1: We suggest interval surveillance (ie, every 1224 months) with axial imaging (ie, CTA or MRA) in cases
of segmental medial arteriolysis in light of reported cases
of rapid arterial transformation. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
5.2: We suggest postembolization surveillance every 1 to
2 years with axial imaging to assess for vascular

remodeling and evidence of aneurysm reperfusion. Level
of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
Hepatic artery aneurysm (HAA). 1.1: In patients who are
thought to have HAA, we recommend computed tomography angiography (CTA) as the diagnostic tool of
choice. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
1.2: In patients with HAA who are considered for intervention, we recommend mesenteric angiography for
preoperative planning. Level of Recommendation:
Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
2.1: Given the high propensity of rupture and signiﬁcant
antecedent mortality, we recommend that all hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms, regardless of cause, be repaired
as soon as the diagnosis is made. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High).
2.2.a: We recommend repair of all symptomatic HAAs
regardless of size. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1
(Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High).
2.2.b: In asymptomatic patients without signiﬁ
