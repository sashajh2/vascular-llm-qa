1.2.1. We recommend that evaluation of reﬂux with DU
be performed in an Intersocietal Accreditation
Commissione or American College of Radiologye
accredited vascular laboratory by a credentialed ultrasonographer, with the patient standing whenever possible.
A sitting or reverse Trendelenburg position can be used if
the patient cannot stand.

1.2.2. We recommend that for evaluation of reﬂux
with DU, either a Valsalva maneuver or distal
augmentation should be used to assess the common
femoral vein and SFJ and distal augmentation should
be used with either manual compression or cuff deﬂation for evaluation of more distal segments. Superﬁcial reﬂux must be traced to its source, including the
saphenous junction, truncal or perforating veins, or
pelvic origin varicose veins. The study should be interpreted by a physician trained in venous DU
interpretation.

Rationale and evidence. The technique of correct DU
scanning to investigate venous reﬂux has been previously
described in detail.56,59,62 A signiﬁcant part of the test
should be performed with the patient in the upright
position to determine the degree of reﬂux and venous
diameter.56 Labropoulos et al56 reported the DU results
for patients examined in the supine and standing positions. DU of 37 vein segments showed reﬂux of >500 ms
with the patients in the supine position. However, when
the study was repeated with the patient standing, 22
segments
(59%)
showed
nonsigniﬁcant
reﬂux
of <500 ms.56 The investigators concluded that “standing
allows more deﬁnitive closure of competent valves.” To
investigate reﬂux, manual compression of the thigh and
calf is suggested to assess reﬂux. In addition, both the
Valsalva technique and rapid cuff deﬂation have been
recommended.59 Masuda et al63 found that reﬂux in the
