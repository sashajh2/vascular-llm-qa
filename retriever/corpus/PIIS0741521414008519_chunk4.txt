SUMMARY OF GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT OF VENOUS ULCER

DEFINITION VENOUS LEG ULCER
Guideline 1.1: Venous Leg Ulcer Deﬁnition
We suggest use of a standard deﬁnition of venous ulcer as an open skin lesion of the leg or foot that occurs in an
area affected by venous hypertension. [BEST PRACTICE]
VENOUS ANATOMY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Guideline 2.1: Venous Anatomy Nomenclature
We recommend use of the International Consensus Committee on Venous Anatomical Terminology for standardized venous anatomy nomenclature. [BEST PRACTICE]
Guideline 2.2: Venous Leg Ulcer Pathophysiology
We recommend a basic practical knowledge of venous physiology and venous leg ulcer pathophysiology for all
practitioners caring for venous leg ulcers. [BEST PRACTICE]

CLINICAL EVALUATION
Guideline 3.1: Clinical Evaluation
We recommend that for all patients with suspected leg ulcers ﬁtting the deﬁnition of venous leg ulcer, clinical
evaluation for evidence of chronic venous disease be performed. [BEST PRACTICE]
Guideline 3.2: Nonvenous Causes of Leg Ulcers
We recommend identiﬁcation of medical conditions that affect ulcer healing and other nonvenous causes of
ulcers. [BEST PRACTICE]
Guideline 3.3: Wound Documentation
We recommend serial venous leg ulcer wound measurement and documentation. [BEST PRACTICE]
Guideline 3.4: Wound Culture
We suggest against routine culture of venous leg ulcers and only to obtain wound culture specimens when clinical evidence of infection is present. [GRADE - 2;
