eridge-Smith306 advises to cannulate the veins in
supine patients and then elevate the limb 30° to inject the
foam. Ultrasonography is used to monitor the movement
of foam in the veins. The saphenous trunk is injected first,
followed by varicose and perforating veins if indicated. A
maximum of 20 mL of foam is injected during one session.
Bergan313 recommends elevation of the limb for 10 to 15
minutes after injection to minimize the volume of foam
that gets into the systemic circulation. The procedure is
completed by placing a short stretch bandage or 30 to 40
mm Hg graduated compression stockings (or both) on
the limb. Although most authors recommend 1 to 2
weeks of compression,313,314 a recent RCT found no
advantage to compression bandaging for ⬎24 hours
when thromboembolus-deterrent stockings were worn
for the remainder of 14 days.315
Complications. Severe complications after sclerotherapy, such as death, anaphylactic reaction, pulmonary emboli, stroke, and large areas of skin necrosis, are very rare
(⬍0.01%).316 Severe but rare complications also include
thrombophlebitis, nerve damage (saphenous, sural), DVT,
or inadvertent arterial injection of the solution.317,318
Transient neurologic adverse effects such as visual disturbance, migraine-like headache, or confusional state may
occur and are more frequent in patients with a patent
foramen ovale.319
Most complications are minor, and include matting,
pigmentation, pain, allergy, and skin urticaria. The higher
the concentration of the agent, the higher the likelihood of
hyperpigmentation, a minor complication that can be observed in up to 30% of the cases.320 Between 70% and 95%
of the pigmentations, however, resolve by 1 year after
therapy.317
The incidence of major neurologic events after foam
injection is rare; instances of stroke were reported by Bush
et al321 and others.319,322,
