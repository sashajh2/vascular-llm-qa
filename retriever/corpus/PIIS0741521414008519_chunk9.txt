] We suggest a combination of mechanical disruption and antibiotic therapy as most likely to be
successful in eradicating venous leg ulcer infection. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 4.12: Systemic Antibiotics
We recommend that venous leg ulcers with clinical evidence of infection be treated with systemic antibiotics
guided by sensitivities performed on wound culture. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C] Oral antibiotics
are preferred initially, and the duration of antibiotic therapy should be limited to 2 weeks unless persistent evidence
of wound infection is present. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 4.13: Topical Antibiotics for Infected Wounds
We suggest against use of topical antimicrobial agents for the treatment of infected venous leg ulcers.
[GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 4.14: Topical Dressing Selection
We suggest applying a topical dressing that will manage venous leg ulcer exudate and maintain a moist, warm
wound bed. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C] We suggest selection of a primary wound dressing that will
absorb wound exudate produced by the ulcer (alginates, foams) and protect the periulcer skin. [GRADE - 2;

Guideline 4.15: Topical Dressings Containing Antimicrobials
We recommend against the routine use of topical antimicrobial-containing dressings in the treatment of noninfected venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - A]
Guideline 4.16: Periulcer Skin Management
We suggest application of skin lubricants underneath compression to reduce dermatitis that commonly affects
periulcer skin. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE -C] In severe cases of dermatitis associated with venous leg
ulcers, we suggest topical steroids to reduce the development of secondary ulcerations and to reduce the symptoms
of dermatitis. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
