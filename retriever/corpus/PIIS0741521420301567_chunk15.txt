1.3: We recommend the use of catheter-based angiography for all emergent cases presenting with rupture,
Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality
of Evidence: B (Moderate), and electively for preoperative planning, Level of Recommendation: Grade 1
(Strong), Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
1.4: We suggest screening all patients with jejunal, ileal,
and colic artery aneurysms for vasculitis with routine inﬂammatory markers. Level of Recommendation: Grade
2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
2.1: We recommend elective intervention for jejunal and
ileal artery aneurysms >2 cm in maximal diameter and for
all colic artery aneurysms, any size. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
2.2: We recommend emergent intervention for any jejunal, ileal, or colic artery aneurysm, any size, resulting in
patient symptoms or rupture and all mesenteric branch
vessel pseudoaneurysms. Level of Recommendation:
Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High).
3.1: We suggest open surgical ligation or aneurysm excision for cases of jejunal, ileal, and colic artery aneurysms
when laparotomy is being considered for hematoma
evacuation or bowel assessment for viability. Level of
Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
3.2: We suggest endovascular embolization for cases of
jejunal, ileal, and colic artery aneurysm. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B
(Moderate).
3.3: We suggest medical treatment of nonruptured,
asymptomatic ileal, jejunal, and colic artery aneurysms
associated with polyarteritis nodosa. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B
(Moderate).
