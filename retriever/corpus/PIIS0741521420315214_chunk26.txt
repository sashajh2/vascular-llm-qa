 aortic coarctation repair.
However, most aortobronchial ﬁstulas originate from a
descending atherosclerotic aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm, which causes an erosion of the lung parenchyma
or tracheobronchial tree.
Coarctation. Aneurysm formation can also develop in
patients late after surgical repair of aortic coarctation in
infancy and has been reported in numerous patients,
with as many as 7% of patients developing “local” aneurysms.42 These aneurysms may be manifested as false,
true, or dissecting.43 Cystic medial necrosis is a common
histopathologic feature observed in coarctation specimens from surgery or autopsy. This provides a pathologic
basis for the formation of aneurysms observed in these
patients after balloon angioplasty or repair.
Kommerell diverticulum. Kommerell diverticulum is a
bulbous aortic dilation that is a remnant of incomplete
regression of an embryologic aortic arch; it is usually
located at or near the origin of an aberrant subclavian artery (ASA).44 Aberrant right and left subclavian arteries (in
a right-sided aortic arch) are typically associated with a
Kommerell diverticulum. The right ASA can arise distal to
the LSA and crosses through the posterior mediastinum
behind the esophagus on its way to the right upper extremity. The aberrant vessel has the potential to cause a
vascular ring around the trachea and esophagus, causing
dysphagia and palsy of the recurrent laryngeal nerve due
to anatomic position. Aneurysms rarely involve the ASA,
but they are associated with a high mortality rate if they
rupture. The risk for rupture or dissection is variable and
ranges from 19% to 53% in some of the case report series.45 Surgical intervention should be considered when
the diameter of the diverticulum exceeds 30 mm or the
diameter of the descending aorta adjacent to the
diverticulum exceeds 50 mm.46-48 Histologic studies
