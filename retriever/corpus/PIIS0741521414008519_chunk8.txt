eline 4.7: Enzymatic Débridement
We suggest enzymatic débridement of venous leg ulcers when no clinician trained in surgical débridement is
available to débride the wound. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C] We do not suggest enzymatic débridement over surgical débridement. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 4.8: Biologic Débridement
We suggest that larval therapy for venous leg ulcers can be used as an alternative to surgical débridement.
[GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 4.9: Management of Limb Cellulitis
We recommend that cellulitis (inﬂammation and infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue) surrounding the
venous leg ulcer be treated with systemic gram-positive antibiotics. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 4.10: Wound Colonization and Bacterial Bioﬁlms
We suggest against systemic antimicrobial treatment of venous leg ulcer colonization or bioﬁlm without clinical
evidence of infection. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 4.11: Treatment of Wound Infection
We suggest that venous leg ulcers with >1 3 106 CFU/g of tissue and clinical evidence of infection be treated
with antimicrobial therapy. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C] We suggest antimicrobial therapy for
virulent or difﬁcult to eradicate bacteria (such as beta-hemolytic streptococci, pseudomonas, and resistant
staphylococcal species) at lower levels of colony-forming units per gram of tissue. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE - C] We suggest a combination of mechanical disruption and antibiotic therapy as most likely to be
successful in eradicating venous leg ulcer infection. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 4.12: Systemic Antibiotics
We recommend that venous leg ulcers with clinical evidence of infection be treated with systemic antibiotics
guided by sensitivities performed on wound culture. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C] Oral antibiotics
