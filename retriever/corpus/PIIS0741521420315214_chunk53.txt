 arch or is very proximal on the LSA, a separate
vertebral transposition or bypass is necessary. A transposition is relatively contraindicated when there is coronary
artery bypass from the LIMA as this would cause myocardial ischemia during subclavian artery clamping and,
potentially, difﬁculties in mobilizing the LSA cephalad if
it is tethered by the LIMA graft.
Complications of LSA revascularization, speciﬁcally in
the setting of TEVAR, have been studied. From the systematic review, the overall incidence of phrenic nerve
injury was low at 4.4% (95% CI, 1.6%-12.20%).142 Woo
et al141 examined 42 patients requiring LSA revascularization (5 transpositions, 37 bypasses), and only 1 patient
(2.4%) developed a phrenic nerve palsy. Zamor et al128
described 23 patients who underwent LSA revascularization (21 transpositions, 2 bypasses) before TEVAR and had
2 (8.7%) occurrences of vocal cord paralysis, one of which

resolved spontaneously. Wound complications, such as
hematoma, lymphatic leak, and dissection, have also
been reported.148 A series of 101 LSA revascularizations
had a relatively high rate of permanent nerve injuries
(9%) along with a 6% lymph leak rate, requiring dietary
modiﬁcation alone.149 Despite these complications, the
series reported only a 2% ischemic stroke rate and 0%
SCI after TEVAR.
Despite a net beneﬁt of reduction in SCI and stroke,150
these complications certainly compromise the effectiveness of TEVAR. Off-label and emerging technologies offer
the potential to reduce the complications of LSA surgical
revascularization. For well over a decade, various techniques have been described for retrograde in situ graft
fenestration and stenting, in which the TEVAR graft is
punctured with a needle or laser and dilated and a
covered stent is inserted to bridge from the fenest
