Guideline 6.3: Superﬁcial Venous Reﬂux and
Healed Venous Leg Ulcer
In a patient with a healed venous leg ulcer (C5) and
incompetent superﬁcial veins that have axial reﬂux
directed to the bed of the ulcer, we recommend ablation of the incompetent veins in addition to standard
compressive therapy to prevent recurrence. [GRADE 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 6.4: Superﬁcial Venous Reﬂux With Skin
Changes at Risk for Venous Leg Ulcer (C4b)
In a patient with skin changes at risk for venous leg
ulcer (C4b) and incompetent superﬁcial veins that have
axial reﬂux directed to the bed of the affected skin, we
suggest ablation of the incompetent superﬁcial veins in
addition to standard compressive therapy to prevent ulceration. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
The evidence supporting this guideline is an extrapolation of the data on ulcer healing and prevention of ulcer
recurrence stated under Guidelines 6.1 and 6.2. In this
group of patients, VLUs had healed, and so intervention
is expected to provide protection from recurrence as noted
in our commissioned comparative systematic review and
meta-analysis and the two RCTs.31,288,317,318

Perforator Venous Reﬂux and Venous Leg Ulcer
Guideline 6.5: Combined Superﬁcial and Perforator Venous Reﬂux With or Without Deep Venous
Reﬂux and Active Venous Leg Ulcer
In a patient with a venous leg ulcer (C6) and
incompetent superﬁcial veins that have reﬂux to the ulcer bed in addition to pathologic perforating veins
(outward ﬂow of >500 ms duration, with a diameter
of >3.5 mm) located beneath or associated with the ulcer bed, we suggest ablation of both the incompetent
superﬁcial veins and perforator veins in addition to
standard compressive therapy to aid in ulcer healing
and to prevent recurrence. [GRADE - 2;
