 patients) and
over a mean follow-up of 62 months restenosis risk
greater than 70%/occlusion was 10% (95% CI, 6.0-16.3) in
patients having CAS. The same study showed that over a
mean of 50 months of surveillance, 1 of 125 CAS patients
(0.8%) with restenosis greater than 70%/occlusion suffered a late ipsilateral stroke compared with 37 of 1839
CAS patients (2%) who did not have greater than 70%
restenosis. Female sex, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were
independent predictors of restenosis or occlusion after
the two procedures.453
Diagnosis
Duplex ultrasound examination is frequently used for
routine follow-up after CAS. The degree of lumen diameter reduction, peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, and the ratio of peak ICA to CCA velocity (ICA/CCA
ratio) are the most common parameters used to quantify
stenosis. In selected cases when results of duplex ultrasound examination are inconclusive, CTA is required. Discrepancies in results with either of these techniques
should be conﬁrmed using DSA.463
However, deﬁnitive criteria for diagnosis of restenosis after CAS have not yet been established and there are few
data on the natural history of in-stent restenosis. Evidence from recent studies suggests that criteria used
for diagnosing an atherosclerotic stenosis of the carotid
artery cannot be easily applied to in-stent restenosis.464
This is due to the distinct biomechanical properties of
the stented artery and its enhanced stiffness which results in increased ﬂow velocity. Recent analysis proposed
adjusted criteria for deﬁning stenosis in stented arteries.464,466,467 A review of 14 studies suggested
recording Doppler parameters of the recently stented
vessel soon after CAS and using these values as the patient’s reference point. This new reference point will
guide future routine surveillance scans.468
Clinical impact
The clinical impact of signiﬁcant restenosis after CAS is
uncertain, but neointimal hyperplasia
