351 treated 80 limbs with sclerotherapy of
the perforating veins. There were no cases of DVT involving the deep vein adjacent to the perforator injected. One
patient had skin complications with skin necrosis.
Results of perforator ablation
Subfascial endoscopic perforator vein surgery. Most
series of SEPS were performed in patients with advanced
disease (class C3-C6, mostly C5 and C6), and perforator
interruption was performed with ablation of the incompetent superficial system. Therefore, benefit directly attributable to perforator interruption is not well known.

Simple varicose veins (CEAP class C2). In an RCT,
Kianifard et al361 analyzed the benefits of adding SEPS to
saphenofemoral ligation and stripping of the GSV in patients
with class C2 disease. The study allocated 38 to the SEPS
group and 34 to the no-SEPS group. The two groups were
similar with respect to pain, mobility, varicose vein recurrence,
and QOL scores during the 1-year follow-up. A significantly
higher proportion of patients in the no-SEPS group had
incompetent perforating veins on duplex imaging at 1 year
(25 of 32 vs 12 of 38; P ‚¨ç .001). This RCT concluded that at
1 year in class C2 patients, no additional clinical benefit could
be observed when SEPS was added to HL/S.
This finding was supported by a prospective study by
van Neer et al362 in 62 limbs with class C2 disease, who had
varicose veins distal to the knee and underwent HL/S of
the GSV to the level of the knee. Clinical and ultrasonographic residual varicose veins at 6 months were not significantly related to the presence of preoperative incompetent
perforating veins.
Chronic venous insufficiency (CEAP class C3-C6). The
North American SEPS registry reported the results of SEPS
performed in 17 U.S. centers on 155 limbs, 85% with class
C5 and C6 disease. Ul
