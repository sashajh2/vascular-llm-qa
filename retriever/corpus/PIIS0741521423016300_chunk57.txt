Rationale
Angiosomes are three dimensional regions of tissue
and skin supplied by a source artery. The six angiosomes
of the foot and ankle are supplied by the posterior tibial
artery (n ¼ 3), peroneal artery (n ¼ 2), and anterior tibial
artery (n ¼ 1) (Fig. 3). Communications between angiosomes include direct arterial to arterial connections, as
well
as
choke
vessels
which
link
adjacent
angiosomes.113e115 The effect or inﬂuence of angiosome
based revascularisation on wound healing and prevention of amputation (major and minor) in the management of diabetes related foot complications remains
controversial.
Direct revascularisation involves revascularisation of the
tibial artery supplying the angiosome in which the tissue
loss has occurred. The alternative to this is indirect revascularisation where the tibial artery treated is the artery in
which successful in line ﬂow to the foot is most likely to
be achieved by endovascular techniques or is deemed
the best tibial outﬂow vessel for anastomosis in bypass
surgery but does not directly supply the affected area
of tissue loss. The systematic review found that open

vascular reconstruction procedures were equally effective whether direct or indirect revascularisation to the
affected foot angiosome was performed.7
In addition, healing and amputation outcomes for
direct and indirect endovascular revascularisation show
that if direct revascularisation is possible, DFU healing
time and major amputation may be reduced compared
with indirect revascularisation. There is inadequate evidence to determine whether direct revascularisation is
superior to indirect revascularisation to prevent minor
amputation.116 Indirect revascularisation with collaterals
was associated with wound healing and limb salvage
outcomes which were similar to direct revascularisation
outcomes and notably better than the indirect revascularisation without collateral cohorts.117e121
The majority of studies included in the systematic review used endovascular procedures with data probably
favouring direct revascularisation. For bypass procedures
there was little difference in healing and amputation
outcomes at 12 months between direct and indirect
