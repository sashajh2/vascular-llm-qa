 thrombosis (SVT), thrombotic
complications of varicose vein treatments, thrombus extension following ablation, management of bleeding varicose
veins and the treatment of superﬁcial vein aneurysms. This
comprehensive document provides a list of all recommendations (Parts I-II), as well as consensus and best practice
statements to aid practitioners with up-to-date, appropriate management of patients with symptomatic lower
extremity varicose veins (Clinical stage, Etiology, Anatomy,
Pathology [CEAP] Class C2 disease). Updates of other, previously published society guidelines5,7,42,43 will address the
management of venous ulcers, associated with varicose
veins (C5-C6 disease), evaluation and treatment of deep
vein obstructions and chronic pelvic venous disorders.

METHODS
A multisociety and multispecialty writing group that
included 20 members authored both Part I and Part II of
these varicose vein guidelines. The methods of writing
Part I of the guidelines was described previously.8 For Part
II, the writing committee conducted a survey and held
several meetings to compose a list of important clinical
topics, not addressed in Part I, that are intended to guide
comprehensive, up-to-date prevention and management
of varicose veins and associated complications. A ﬁnal list
of 80 questions were divided into ﬁve sections, with each
assigned to a writing group. The members of the groups
performed an extensive search, up to January 31, 2023, of
the English-language literature on their relevant topic, using
the Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of
Science, Cochrane Library, and Ovid Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews databases. Systematic reviews, metaanalyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and prospective and retrospective observational studies that included
>10 patients with varicose veins were used. Drafts of the
writing groups were discussed on Zoom meetings, and all
recommendations and statements were unanimously
approved by the writing committee. All clinical practice

guidelines in Part II were based on evidence established
with one or several systematic reviews, with or without
meta-analysis, using the GRADE method,44-46 as described
