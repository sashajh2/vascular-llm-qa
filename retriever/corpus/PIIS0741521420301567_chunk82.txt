 rupture
rates of 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%, respectively, for an 80-yearold patient. Preventive treatment was dominated by no
treatment if mortality rates of preventive treatment
were >3.3%, >5.9%, >8.0%, and >9.7% at annual rupture
rates of 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%, respectively, for a 50-year-old
patient.
Predictive factors of rupture, whether size, demographics, or comorbid disease, are few. A review of the
English literature found that 32% of ruptured patients
were female and 61% were male.215 In one single-center
study, rupture was associated with male sex (P ¼ .02)
and a trend toward rupture in patients with celiac stenosis (P ¼ .10).216 Thus, male patients should be considered
for elective repair even in the presence of moderate
operative risk.

Long-term success may be related to angiographic
ﬁndings seen on completion imaging. The RaymondRoy Occlusion Classiﬁcation is a system for evaluating
aneurysm occlusion after endovascular coiling with
three classes based on completion imaging at the
end of the procedure.218 Class I is deﬁned as complete
obliteration; class II, a residual neck; and class III, a residual aneurysm. Class III can be further subdivided
into IIIa, residual contrast within coil interstices, and
IIIb, residual aneurysm with contrast material along
the sidewall of the aneurysm. Class IIIa aneurysms
tend to have a higher rate of subsequent thrombosis,
whereas IIIb aneurysms tend to have a higher rate of
re-treatment.219
Whereas survival is unrelated to operative technique in
repair of intact aneurysms, endovascular repair of
ruptured aneurysms is associated with both improved
overall survival and aneurysm-related survival compared
with open surgery.4,209
