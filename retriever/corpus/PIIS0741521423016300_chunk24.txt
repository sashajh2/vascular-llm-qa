ranging from 4.17 to 17.91; however, the ability to rule disease out is variable (NLR 0 e 0.54) (Supplementary
Table S1). A TBI < 0.70 has a moderate ability to diagnose
and exclude PAD (PLR 2.0 e 3.55, NLR 0.25 e 0.44), and
the presence of a visual monophasic pedal Doppler
waveform (compared with a biphasic or triphasic
Doppler waveform where the waveform crosses the
zero ﬂow baseline and contains both forward and reverse
velocity components)53 has a moderate ability to diagnose and exclude PAD (PLR 7.09, NLR 0.19).
Non-invasive bedside tests are therefore likely to be
beneﬁcial for people without a DFU; however, high quality studies of diagnostic accuracy are required. A summary of results is provided in Supplementary Table S1.
When calculating the ABI in the leg of a person with and
without DFU for the purposes of diagnosing PAD, it is
advised to use the lower systolic blood pressure of either
the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery as this improves
the diagnostic accuracy of the test.5 For PAD affecting arteries below the knee, this calculation method identiﬁes
the most severe disease while using the higher pressure
identiﬁes the least affected artery. Use of three tests (ABI,
TBI, and pedal Doppler waveforms) is recommended.
This is because the accuracy of the tests may be affected
by the presence of other diabetes related complications.
Due to the use of bedside measures to monitor PAD status
over time, reliability (or reproducibility) of the tests is important in determining their clinical effectiveness. The systematic review showed that the
