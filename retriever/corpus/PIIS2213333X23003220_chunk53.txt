follow-up was short. The review found moderatecertainty evidence that phlebotonics in patients with
CVI probably reduced edema in the lower legs,
compared with placebo (risk ratio [RR] 0.70; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 0.63-0.78; 13 studies; 1245 participants);
and probably reduced ankle circumference (MD,
e4.27 mm; 95% CI, e5.61 to e2.93 mm; 15 studies; 2010
participants). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that

phlebotonics probably make little or no difference in
QOL compared with placebo (standard mean difference
[SMD], e0.06; 95% CI, e0.22 to 0.10; ﬁve studies; 1639
participants); and low-certainty of evidence suggested
that they may have little or no effect on ulcer healing (RR,
0.94; 95% CI, 0.79-1.13; six studies; 461 participants). There
was low certainty of evidence that phlebotonics may
reduce pain, measured as a continuous variable,
