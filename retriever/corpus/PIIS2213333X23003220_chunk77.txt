is et al
studied 611 limbs with primary varicose veins. Of 454
limbs that showed GSV reﬂux on DUS, 240 limbs
exhibited reﬂux of both the GSV and SFJ and 214 limbs
(35%) showed isolated GSV reﬂux with a competent SFJ.
The authors suggested that reﬂux starts distally and
progresses proximally.143 In light of these studies, treatment of isolated SFJ reﬂux appears unnecessary.
5.2.4. In patients with symptomatic C2 disease, ablation of the incompetent GSV may be indicated even
if the axial reﬂux is not complete and the SFJ is competent. Ablation of isolated reﬂuxing GSV segments, in
the presence of competent segments proximally and
distally, is rarely indicated. Shared decision-making
with the patient is warranted.
Consensus statement.
Rationale and evidence. Reﬂux patterns have been
evaluated in multiple studies, and as discussed above, a
signiﬁcant percentage of symptomatic patients have
been shown to have lower extremity axial reﬂux without
SFJ insufﬁciency. Engelhorn et al145 found SFJ incompetence in only 12% of 590 limbs of 326 women with varicose and spider veins (CEAP Class C1-C2). Aurshina
et al146 in their single-center retrospective review of 265
patients including 41 without junctional reﬂux noted that
the location of reﬂux did not affect patient presentation
or outcomes at two years after vein ablation. Others reported more advanced clinical disease in patients with
reﬂux involving the SFJ.147 The common observation in
these studies is that early ablation of the GSV results in
good outcome in symptomatic patients, who have
competent SFJ but incompetent distal thigh or upper
calf GSV.
In contrast, segmental or complete ablation of the GSV
is rarely indicated for isolated reﬂuxing segments with
competent segments proximally and distally (Table XII).
The GSV has an average of 6.7 valves (range, 3-11 valves).149
