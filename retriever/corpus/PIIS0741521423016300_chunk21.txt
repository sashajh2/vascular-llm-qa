Recommendation 1
In a person with diabetes without a foot ulcer, take a relevant
history for peripheral artery disease, examine the foot for signs
of ischaemia and palpate the foot pulses at least annually, or
with any change in clinical status of the feet.

Recommendation 2
In a person with diabetes without a foot ulcer, if peripheral
artery disease (PAD) is suspected, consider performing pedal
Doppler waveforms in combination with ankle brachial index
(ABI) and toe brachial index (TBI). No single modality has been
shown to be optimal for the diagnosis of PAD and there is no
value above which PAD can be excluded. However, PAD is less
likely in the presence of ABI 0.9 e 1.3; TBI $ 0.70; and triphasic
or biphasic pedal Doppler waveforms.

Rationale. Diagnosis and treatment of PAD is critical
due to the increased risk of developing DFU as well as
the increased rate of complications from co-existent
cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction
and stroke.35 Evidence for the diagnostic accuracy of
pulse palpation for PAD in people with diabetes without
DFU is limited with two studies of low quality demonstrating that although presence of pulses does not
exclude disease, there is a small increase in ability to rule
disease in where a foot pulse is absent or weak (positive
likelihood ratio [PLR] 1.84 e 2.46).44,45 The PLR gives the
change in odds of experiencing an outcome if the test is
positive, whereas the negative likelihood ratio (NLR) expresses a change in odds of experiencing an outcome if
the test is negative. A PLR or NLR of 1.0 means that the
test does not change the probability of the outcome over
and above the pre-test probability and
