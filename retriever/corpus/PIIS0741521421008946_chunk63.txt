Medical high risk
Age > 75 years old
Heavily calciﬁed carotid stenosis
Complex bifurcation stenosis
>15 mm length
Tortuous ICA
Tortuous CCA
Type 3 or tortuous aortic arch
Heavy atherosclerotic burden of arch

CCA, Common carotid artery; CEA, carotid endarterectomy; ICA, internal carotid artery; TCAR, transcervical carotid stent; TF-CAS, transfemoral carotid stent.

2. Neurologically asymptomatic patients with a 70% or
greater diameter stenosis should be considered for
CEA, TCAR, or transfemoral CAS for reduction of
long-term risk of stroke, provided the patient has a
3- to 5-year life expectancy and perioperative stroke/
death rates can be 3% or less. Perhaps future models
to help estimate life expectancy based on calculating
various physiologic comorbidities such as cardiac, pulmonary, renal, malignancy, will be available in the
future. The determination for which technique to
use should be based on the presence or absence of
high risk criteria for CEA, TCAR, or transfemoral CAS
(Table I).
3. CEA is preferred over transfemoral CAS in symptomatic patients with 50% or greater stenosis who are
candidates for both procedures. TCAR is preferred
over transfemoral CAS but not CEA in symptomatic
patients with 50% or greater stenosis.
4. Transfemoral CAS is preferred over CEA in symptomatic patients with 50% or greater stenosis and
tracheal stoma, situation where local tissues are
scarred and ﬁbrotic from prior ipsilateral surgery or
external beam radiotherapy. CEA or TCAR may be
preferable in situations where ipsilateral tissue planes
remain relatively intact (Table II).
5. TCAR is preferred over CEA and transfemoral CAS in
symptomatic patients with 50% or greater stenosis
and lesion above C2 (Table II).
