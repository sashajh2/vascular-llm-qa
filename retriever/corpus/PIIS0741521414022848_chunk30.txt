The effect of diabetes
control on mortality
and morbidity of
patients with IC
The effect of antiplatelet
therapy on mortality
and morbidity of
patients with IC

No direct trials in PAD;
indirect evidence
considered

Smoking cessation reduces overall
mortality and morbidity in smokers
in general
Lipid-lowering therapy had no
statistically signiﬁcant effect on
mortality (OR, 0.86; 95% CI,
0.49-1.50) or total cardiovascular
events (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.59-1.09)
but improved total walking distance
(152 m; 95% CI, 32.11-271.88 m) and
pain-free walking distance (89.76 m;
95% CI, 30.05-149.47 m), with no
signiﬁcant effect on ABI104
Tight glycemic control in patients with
type 2 diabetes reduced amputation
(RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45-0.94)105

The effect of cilostazol
and pentoxifylline on
walking performance
in patients with IC

Meta-analysis106 of 12 trials
in patients with IC

Meta-analysis107 of 26 trials
in patients with IC

Antiplatelet agents reduced all cause
(RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60-0.98),
cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.54;
95% CI, 0.32-0.93), and the risk of
needing revascularization (RR, 0.65;
95% CI, 0.43-0.97). Major bleeding
estimate was imprecise (RR, 1.73; 95%
CI, 0.51-5.83). In one trial,
clopidogrel had a modest advantage
over aspirin
