with class C5 and C6 disease were published by Iafrati et
al,364 who performed SEPS alone in 23 limbs and SEPS
with stripping in 28. The ulcers healed rapidly, and the
5-year ulcer recurrence rate was low (13%).
Post-thrombotic patients do worse than those with
primary incompetence. In the Mayo Clinic series, 5-year
ulcer recurrence was 56% in post-thrombotic patients vs
15% in patients with primary valvular incompetence (P ‚¨ç
.05).365,366 Post-thrombotic patients with significant deep
venous disease still gained some benefit, as measured by
improved VCSS as well as an apparent ease in treating the
smaller and more superficial ulcers compared with their
preoperative state.
A single-center cohort study by Bianchi et al367 observed ulcer healing in 91% (53 of 58) of limbs with C6
disease at a mean of 2.9 months (range, 13 days-17
months) after SEPS and saphenous stripping. Ulcer recur-

rence at 30 months was 6%. Ulcer recurrence at 4 years
was as high as 31% in the ESCHAR study when compression treatment was combined with surgical ablation of
the superficial reflux, but no perforator interruption was
performed.157
In a large, retrospective, multicenter cohort study,
Tawes et al368 monitored 832 patients with CEAP clinical
class C4 to C6 for 9 years after SEPS. Only 55% of the
patients underwent HL/S in addition to SEPS. In this
study, 92% of ulcers healed with only 4% recurrences. There
was a 3% nonfatal complication rate, and significant improvement was documented in venous hemodynamics in a
subset of patients.
In a systematic review, Tenbrook et al38 reported results of the SEPS procedure performed with or without
superficial ablation on 1140 limbs in 1 RCT and 19 case
series. Ulcers in 88
