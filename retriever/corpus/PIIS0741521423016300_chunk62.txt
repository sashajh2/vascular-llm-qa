 necessary depending on the risk of severe
hypoglycaemia.
Blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg but higher target levels
may be necessary depending on the risk of orthostatic
hypotension and other side effects.
Low density lipoprotein target of < 1.8 mmol/L (< 70 mg/
dL) and reduced by at least 50% of baseline. If high intensity statin therapy (with or without ezetimibe) is
tolerated, target levels < 1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL) are
recommended.

Recommendation 24
In a person with diabetes and symptomatic peripheral artery
disease:

treatment with single antiplatelet therapy should be
used,
treatment with clopidogrel should be considered as ﬁrst
choice in preference to aspirin,
combination therapy with aspirin (75 mg to 100 mg once
daily) plus low dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily)
should be considered for people without a high bleeding
risk.

Recommendation 25
In a person with type 2 diabetes and peripheral artery disease:

with an eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73m2, a sodium glucose
cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor or a glucagon like
peptide 1 receptor agonist with demonstrated cardiovascular disease beneﬁt should be considered, irrespective of the blood glucose level.
SGLT-2 inhibitors should not be started in drug naïve
people with a diabetes related foot ulcer or gangrene
and temporary discontinuation should be considered in
people already using these drugs, until the affected foot
is healed.

Rationale
The Writing Committee decided to not write their own
guidelines on pharmacological interventions in people
with diabetes, PAD, and a foot ulcer or gangrene in order
to reduce cardiovascular risk or to prevent major limb
events as deﬁned above. There are already a number of
guidelines on cardiovascular risk prevention in people
with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and
