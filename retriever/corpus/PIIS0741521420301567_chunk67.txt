 with HAA are diagnosed
with CT performed for other reasons.150 Given the
sensitivity and speciﬁcity of CTA for diagnosis of other
intra-abdominal aneurysms, we recommend CTA to
diagnose other intra-abdominal aneurysms. In thin
patients, abdominal duplex ultrasound is sensitive
and speciﬁc in detecting abdominal or iliac artery aneurysms, but this study needs to be performed on individual arteries and therefore may miss other
noninvestigated vessels.
There is an association between HAA and the patients
with ﬁbromuscular dysplasia, vasculitis, systemic lupus
erythematosus or polyarteritis nodosa, Takayasu arteritis,
and Wegener granulomatosis.153-158 This screening study
may detect other pathologic processes that will require
attention. In addition, congenital causes of HAA, such
as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and
Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, are reported.159 Axial
CTA or MRA may detect thoracic or intracerebral
aneurysms.
Given that these are slow-growing aneurysms,150
annual follow-up is adequate. CTA with or without
contrast enhancement provides the best modality to
observe these aneurysms. Abdominal duplex ultrasound
can also be used in certain patients to observe these
aneurysms.

4.1

We suggest abdominal axial imaging to screen for concomitant intraabdominal aneurysms in patients who did not have CTA at the time of
HAA diagnosis.

4.2

We suggest one-time screening CTA or MRA of the head, neck, and chest
for those patients with nonatherosclerotic causes of HAA.
