null), or need for reoperation at follow-up.
In addition, 100% of reconstructions were patent by
imaging obtained during the ﬁrst year of follow-up.
Case reports and small series that suggest indications
for endovascular repair have broadened with the introduction of three-dimensional detachable coils, nonadhesive liquid embolic agents (eg, Onyx [Medtronic,
Irvine, Calif]), remodeling techniques (which include
balloon- and stent-assisted coiling), and ﬂow diverter
stents (eg, the Cardiatis multilayer stent [Cardiatis,
Isnes, Belgium]), although traditional endovascular
therapies have simply used embolization techniques
for distal and parenchymal aneurysms and stent graft
exclusion for main renal artery lesions.63-70 Technical
success across larger series is reported as 73% to
100%, with highly variable rates of morbidity (13%-

Prospective comparisons of open and endovascular
therapies for RAA are needed, although the feasibility
of such a trial is limited primarily by the low frequency
of this pathologic process. To this end, there have been
retrospective comparisons. A recent statewide database
review identiﬁed 215 patients who underwent RAA repair
between 2000 and 2006.33 These authors noted a significant increase in the number of RAA repairs with a stable
number of open repairs and an increase in the number
of endovascular repairs. Analysis of in-hospital outcome
events revealed similar mortality rates (1.1% endovascular
vs 3.3% open) and variable patterns of perioperative
morbidity; open repair was associated with more cardiac
(P ¼ .053) and infectious (P ¼ .053) complications,
whereas endovascular repair was associated with more
hemorrhagic complications (P ¼ .08), presumed to be
access related. Importantly, a signiﬁcant reduction in
median hospital length of stay and need for postdischarge nursing services was identiﬁed in the endovascular cohort accompanied by a trend toward lower cost.
Additional retrospective comparisons of open and endovascular procedures have reported no signiﬁcant difference in
