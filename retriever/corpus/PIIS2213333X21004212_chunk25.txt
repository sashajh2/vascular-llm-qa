ﬁcant association was found when
HL/S was compared with EVLA (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.761.28; I2 ¼ 78.4%; 12 studies34,37,49,61-64,69,73,101,104,108). HL/S
was associated with lower risk of minor AEs than UGFS
(RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55-0.88; I2 ¼ 43%; 7
studies26,32,56,66,101,104,108).
Serious AEs. There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between HL/S and EVLA, RFA, or UGFS (RR, 1.11;
95% CI, 0.50-2.48; I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies101,104), (RR, 1.41;
95% CI, 0.24-8.45; 1 study51) and (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.492.03; I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies101,104), respectively.
Total AEs. HL/S was signiﬁcantly associated with an
increased risk of total AEs than RFA (RR, 1.65; 95% CI,
1.16-2.35; I2 ¼ 72.5%; 10 studies33,36,38,39,51,57,58,71,104,109). No
statistically signiﬁcant association was found when HL/S
was compared with EVLA (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.77-1.27;
I2 ¼ 74.6%; 12 studies34,37,49,61-64,69,73,10
