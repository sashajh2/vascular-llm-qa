cava. There will frequently be a mixture of primary valve
reﬂux and post-thrombotic secondary venous occlusion at
different levels of the venous tree, and decisions as to the
most critical site of disease have to be made from detailed
preoperative anatomic analysis of the extremity veins. The
principles that guide the choice of an individual procedure
include the need for adequate inﬂow pressure and volume
into and out of the repaired segments and preferential use
of autogenous tissue for each element of the repair. Often,
there is need to combine various techniques, such as endophlebectomy with bypass or with valve repair or venous
transplantation. All of the techniques described in this and
the following Guideline sections are potential choices that
might be used in combination with endophlebectomy to
provide the inﬂow and outﬂow needed for success. Evidence
shows a preponderance of successful results for all techniques in 40% to 60% of cases with follow-up of 2 to 4
years.359-371 Variations occur according to the status of
the inﬂow vessels in the extremity and the outﬂow vessels
from the common femoral vein.
On the basis of evidence for patients with lower extremity infrainguinal deep venous obstruction, autogenous
venous bypass or endophlebectomy is suggested, depending on the status of inﬂow and outﬂow vessels.367-371 Challenges exist with identiﬁcation of physiologic degrees of
obstruction and the quality of the obstructed vein that
will determine the need for autogenous vein bypass
conduit. Future expansion of endovascular techniques in
combination with endophlebectomy can be predicted in
this area.372,373
Guideline 6.10: Deep Venous Reﬂux With Skin
Changes at Risk for Venous Leg Ulcer (C4b), Healed
(C5) or Active (C6) Venous Leg UlcerdLigation
In a patient with infrainguinal deep venous reﬂux
and skin changes at risk for venous leg ulcer (C4b),
healed venous leg ulcer (C5), or active venous leg ulcer
(C6), we suggest against deep
