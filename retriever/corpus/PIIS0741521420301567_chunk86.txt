, the overall risk
is likely to be low.208 However, a low threshold for celiac
revascularization should be considered in patients with
symptoms of mesenteric insufﬁciency at baseline or
when there is a risk of compromising end-organ perfusion with aneurysm treatment, and postoperative liver
function test results should be monitored closely.4,212 In
cases of median arcuate ligament syndrome, celiac
revascularization can be achieved with division of the
median arcuate ligament and celiac plexus, aortoceliac
bypass, or renohepatic bypass.230 In cases not associated
with median arcuate ligament compression, primary
stenting of a celiac stenosis is an option.216,231

Recommendations for screening of patients with PDAA and GDAA

In patients with median arcuate ligament syndrome, we suggest screening for GDAA or
PDAA with CTA or duplex ultrasound.

artery in an effort to improve laminar ﬂow within the
parent artery and to reduce blood ﬂow within the aneurysm sac to the point of thrombosis.226 Furthermore,
these stents preserve ﬂow through collateral side
branches. The stents require an overall porosity of 50%
to 70%, or 30% to 50% metallic coverage. Stents such
as the Pipeline Embolization Device (ev3, Plymouth,
Minn), the SILK Arterial Reconstruction Device (Balt
Extrusion, Montmorency, France), and the Cardiatis
multilayer stent are available; however, only the Cardiatis
multilayer stent has been used to treat a GDAA. At
6 months, the Cardiatis stent was patent with complete
thrombosis of the aneurysm sac.227 Patients are treated
with dual antiplatelet regimens postoperatively. In patients with suitable anatomy, ﬂow-diverting, multilayered
stents may become a treatment option for GDAA and
PDAA, although these have not been adequately studied
to be recommended
