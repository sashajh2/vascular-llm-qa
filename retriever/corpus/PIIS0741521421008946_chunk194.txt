and $10,133, respectively. Assuming a procedural stroke
rate of 0.9% for CEA and 5.0% for CAS, and a 30-day mortality rate of 0% for CEA and 1.2% for CAS, CEA was found
to be associated with a lifetime saving of $7017 per patient and an increase in quality-adjusted life years saved
of 0.16.668 In another report, a cost utility analysis using a
Markov model was carried out using a Korean database
which included 346 CAS and 331 CEA procedures performed for symptomatic disease. CAS produced 6.49
quality-adjusted life-years compared with 6.71 qualityadjusted life-years for CEA, with signiﬁcantly higher costs
for CAS.669 Similarly, the Canadian health system database was used to carry out a cost utility analysis among
symptomatic patients using a Markov analytical model.
In the base case analysis, CAS was noted to be more
costly (incremental cost of $6107) and have a lower utility
(e0.12 quality-adjusted life-years). The drivers of these results were the costs of the procedures and the incidence
of periprocedural complications. CAS was only cost effective among high-surgical risk patients.670
In the CREST, estimated net costs were $18,335 and
$13,276 for CAS and CEA, respectively.671 However, in
another report, a Markov disease simulation model was
used to analyze CREST data to project 10-year costs
and quality-adjusted life-year expectancy for the two patient populations. CAS was associated with a mean

incremental cost of $524 per patient and a reduction in
quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.008 years. It is unclear whether the practitioners who participated in
CREST through a rigorous selection process reﬂect
what can be expected in general practice of CAS and
CEA.672 The authors of the latter study also noted that
although CEA and CAS provided comparable overall results, more widespread
