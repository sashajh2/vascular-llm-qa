ema, total symptom score and
reduced inﬂammatory mediators in patients with CVD.
In a meta-analysis comparing efﬁcacy of different
VADs15 sulodexide was included only in a single network
meta-analysis for the proportion of patients with

complete ulcer healing and it showed to have the highest probability of being the best treatment (48%)
compared with pentoxifylline (37%) and MPFF (16%).
The assessment of the sulodexide efﬁcacy on venous
symptoms was done in the meta-analysis of 18 observational studies showing a signiﬁcant improvement of
pain, feeling of swelling, heaviness and paresthesia
measured by Likert scales.
In one randomized trial endovenous laser treatment of
the GSV and phlebectomy were followed by sulodexide
twice daily for 1 month and compared with the control
group with no adjunctive pharmacotherapy. compared
with the control group, in the main group there was a
statistically signiﬁcant decrease in VCSS and improvement in the QOL assessed by CIVIQ-20. The microcirculation of the skin was assessed by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry.
Laboratory examinations measured markers of endothelial dysfunction (homocysteine, von Willebrand factor,
PAI1, soluble (s)E-selectin, sP-selectin, sICAM-1, and
sVCAM-1). An increase in tissue perfusion, and an
improvement in the microcirculation was found in the
sulodexide group.308
A prospective, multicenter, RCT assessed sulodexide as
adjunctive treatment to the sclerotherapy. Group A (n ¼
354 patients) received sulodexide twice a day for 7 days
before sclerotherapy and group B (n ¼ 366 patients)
received standard sclerotherapy alone. Polidocanol and
20 to 30 mm Hg compression stockings were used in
both groups for 7 days. After 1 month, the incidence of
hyperpigmentation was 8.7% in group A and 14.8% in
group B (P ¼ .01). Group A developed an
