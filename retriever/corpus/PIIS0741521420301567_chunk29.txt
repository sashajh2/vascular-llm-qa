eurysm rupture, in a series of
180,000 pregnancies brought to term, no ruptures were
identiﬁed.46 Despite this, small aneurysm size (ie, 1 cm)
at rupture and high historic rates of maternal and fetal
mortality that approximate 56% to 92% and 82% to
100%, respectively, support the more aggressive treatment of RAAs in women of childbearing potential.36,41,47
Contemporary outcomes for both mother and fetus
may be improving as there are reports of gestational
rupture with both maternal and fetal survival.44,48
Two-thirds of patients with RAA also have
hypertension.9,31,36,37,39,40,49-52 Clinically relevant renal artery stenosis is present in 7% to 66% of patients with RAA
across series, and although renal artery occlusive disease
is not evidenced in all RAA patients with hypertension, it
does remain a valid indication for intervention. Whereas
the mechanism driving hypertension in RAA patients remains elusive, additional hypotheses include distal parenchymal embolization, compression or kinking of
associated renal artery branches, and hemodynamic
changes from turbulent blood ﬂow within the aneurysm
resulting in decreased distal renal artery perfusion
pressures.9,27,49,53,54 Whatever the etiology, most series
suggest improvement or cure in the majority of hypertensive patients undergoing RAA reconstruction, particularly
if renovascular hypertension is identiﬁed during the
preoperative workup.14,31,32,36-39,49,51,52,55 Martin et al36
evaluated for renovascular hypertension preoperatively
and demonstrated that 100% of those operated on
with documented renovascular hypertension improved
or were cured of hypertension, whereas only 60% of
those with an unremarkable workup for stenosis were
cured or improved. Pfeiffer et al50 similarly noted a
differential
improvement
in
hypertension
after
aneurysm repair in those with documented renal artery
sten
