 material
in the power injector when possible (typically to 50%
or 70%). Adjustments in injection volume and time
(faster injection of smaller doses) can usually compensate when additional visibility is required. Level of
recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low)
Recommendation 25: We suggest the use of on-table
mapping software options on ﬁxed-imaging X-ray
systems, such as roadmapping and computed tomography (CT) fusion or overlay reference, to aid in locating
target landing sites and to minimize need for repeated
injections. If available, CT overlay capability is extremely
useful, especially in cases in which location and
cannulation of branches will be needed. Level of
recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence:
B (Moderate)
Recommendation 26: To decrease the risk of atheroembolization, we recommend minimizing intra-aortic
wire, catheter, and endograft manipulation in the aortic
arch and at or above the visceral/renal arteries, especially
in patients with signiﬁcant aortic atheromatous disease
or thrombus. Level of recommendation: Grade 1
(Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)

Recommendation 27: We recommend minimizing the
dwelling time of large or occlusive iliofemoral artery
sheaths to decrease the risk of spinal cord ischemia
and lower extremity ischemia that can lead to postoperative compartment syndrome or rhabdomyolysis. In
cases in which a large sheath must be left in place for
a prolonged time, it can be withdrawn into the external
iliac artery to allow antegrade ﬂow into the ipsilateral internal iliac artery. Meticulous postoperative vigilance to
detect inadequate lower extremity perfusion or
compartment syndrome should be routine. Level of
recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 28: We recommend pre-emptive
superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenting with a
balloon-expandable stent in cases of >50% stenosis of
the SMA in the following conditions: before or after celiac
artery (CA) coverage or encroachment, with TEVAR that
is enc
