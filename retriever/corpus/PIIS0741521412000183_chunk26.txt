% CI, 0.34-4.45), or intracranial
hemorrhage (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 0.21-13.70).20 Notably,
these authors observed that bleeding complications, which
occurred in 10% of thrombolytic patients compared with
8% of patients treated with anticoagulation, tended to
decrease over time, perhaps reflecting improved thrombolytic techniques and more rigorous exclusion criteria. Finally, a pooled analysis of 19 studies, largely single-center
case series, reported major bleeding in a mean of 8.3% of
patients (range, 0%-24%) and rates of symptomatic PE,
intracranial hemorrhage, and death of 0.9% (range, 0%1%), 0.2% (range, 0%-1%), and 0.3% (range, 0%-1%),
respectively.27
There are little comparative data evaluating optimal
thrombolytic agents, doses of lytic agents and concurrent
anticoagulants, and infusion techniques. Streptokinase, although rarely used due to the risks of allergic reactions and
bleeding, remains the only thrombolytic agent approved by
the United States Food and Drug Administration for the
treatment of DVT. Several series, however, have reported
the successful use of urokinase,16,69-72 tissue plasminogen
activator,69-71 reteplase,69-71 and tenecteplase73 for venous
thrombolysis.
A consensus panel of the Society of Interventional
Radiology has reviewed recommended thrombolytic dosages and techniques for their catheter-directed administration.68 Because patient characteristics and bleeding risks
vary, individual judgment is required in the selection of
appropriate thrombolytic and concurrent anticoagulant
doses. Most would agree that thrombolytic infusion times
should be minimized and balanced against lytic progress to
avoid complications. Reimaging with follow-up venography at 8- to 24-hour intervals68 and discontinuation of
therapy once lytic stagnation is reached are commonly
