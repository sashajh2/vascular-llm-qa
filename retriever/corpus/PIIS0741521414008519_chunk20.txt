PRIMARY PREVENTION
Guideline 8.1: Primary PreventiondClinical CEAP C3-4 Primary Venous Disease
In patients with clinical CEAP C3-4 disease due to primary valvular reﬂux, we recommend compression, 20 to
30 mm Hg, knee or thigh high. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 8.2: Primary PreventiondClinical CEAP C1-4 Post-thrombotic Venous Disease
In patients with clinical CEAP C1-4 disease related to prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT), we recommend
compression, 30 to 40 mm Hg, knee or thigh high. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 8.3. Primary PreventiondAcute DVT Treatment
As post-thrombotic syndrome is a common preceding event for venous leg ulcers, we recommend current
evidence-based therapies for acute DVT treatment. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B] We suggest use of
low-molecular-weight heparin over vitamin K antagonist therapy of 3-month duration to decrease postthrombotic syndrome. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B] We suggest catheter-directed thrombolysis in patients with low bleeding risk with iliofemoral DVT of duration <14 days. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 8.4: Primary PreventiondEducation Measures
In patients with C1-4 disease, we suggest patient and family education, regular exercise, leg elevation when at
rest, careful skin care, weight control, and appropriately ﬁtting foot wear. [BEST PRACTICE]
Guideline 8.5: Primary PreventiondOperative Therapy
In patients with asymptomatic C1-2 disease from either primary or secondary causes, we suggest against prophylactic interventional therapies to prevent venous leg ulcer. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
