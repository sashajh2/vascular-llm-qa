 and bleeding risks
vary, individual judgment is required in the selection of
appropriate thrombolytic and concurrent anticoagulant
doses. Most would agree that thrombolytic infusion times
should be minimized and balanced against lytic progress to
avoid complications. Reimaging with follow-up venography at 8- to 24-hour intervals68 and discontinuation of
therapy once lytic stagnation is reached are commonly

recommended. Concurrent anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin is recommended during thrombolytic
procedures, although doses may differ depending on the
thrombolytic agent and there is no robust scientific evidence to guide dosing. Previous consensus recommendations from the Society of Interventional Radiology suggest
that subtherapeutic doses of heparin are appropriate for all
thrombolytic agents except urokinase, in which case therapeutic anticoagulation may be considered.68
3.2. We suggest a strategy of pharmacomechanical
thrombolysis be considered over catheter-directed
pharmacologic thrombolysis alone if expertise and resources are available (Grade 2C). Although more efficient than the systemic administration of thrombolytic
agents, catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis remains limited by prolonged infusion times (averaging 53.4
hours), the potential for bleeding complications,20 and the
frequent requirement for hospitalization in the intensive
care unit.71 A variety of mechanical devices have been
designed to work in conjunction with thrombolytic agents
in an effort to improve the efficiency of thrombolysis,
reduce lytic doses and procedure times, and lessen bleeding
complications. These approaches, which include rotational,
rheolytic, and ultrasound-assisted devices, are collectively
referred to as pharmacomechanical thrombolysis.17,74 Limited data suggest that these devices should be used in
conjunction with pharmacologic lytic agents, significant
lysis (â¬Ž50%) being achieved in only one-third of patients
treated with mechanical devices alone.70 The use of mechanical devices alone, without the concurrent use of
thrombolytic drugs, cannot be routinely recommended.
