Atherosclerotic risk factors and medical comorbidities predisposing toward an increased prevalence of
carotid artery stenosis. Screening has been found to
reduce the risk of stroke in a cost-effective manner
when the prevalence of signiﬁcant stenosis is $20%.68

Association guidelines noted that screening before
CABG is probably indicated for the following subset of
patients: age $65 years; the presence of left main coronary artery stenosis; a history of smoking, a history of
TIA, stroke, or carotid bruit; and known peripheral arterial
disease (PAD).78 Based on these and other reports, the
SVS does advocate carotid artery screening for high-risk
patients aged $55 years with appropriate cardiovascular
risk factors.75,79
Other investigators have noted that the prevalence of
occult carotid stenosis is increased in those with diabetes
compared with those without diabetes (8.7% vs 2.8%; P <
