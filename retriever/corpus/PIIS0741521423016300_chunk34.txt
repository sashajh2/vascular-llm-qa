 elevated ABI is therefore seen as a
marker for more severe cardiovascular disease with an
elevated risk of amputation.68,69
TP and TBI can assess blood ﬂow distal to the forefoot
and in toes, where most DFUs occur.70 Based on 10
studies of low quality it was found that with TP $ 30
mmHg the pre-test probability of healing was
increased by up to 30%.71 Regarding major amputation, a value < 30 mmHg increases the probability of
major amputation by approximately 20%, which suggests a (somewhat) lower predictive capacity
compared with the ABI. In the three studies identiﬁed,
there was inconsistent and insufﬁcient evidence for the
use of the TBI to predict either healing or major
amputation.
TcPO2 and SPP are additional tests that have the
advantage of measuring perfusion at tissue level and
therefore reﬂect both macrovascular and microvascular
function. In the systematic review the majority of available studies (n ¼ 7) which were of low quality, reported
that TcPO2 can be used to predict the likelihood of
DFU healing,71e80 although there is variability in the
thresholds used. With a TcPO2 $ 25 mmHg the pre-test
probability of healing is increased by up to 45%, which
was higher than reported for the other tests in the
included studies. Regarding amputation, a value < 25
mmHg increases the probability of major amputation
by approximately 20%, a predictive value that seems
lower than that of the ABI when the different studies
were compared. An SPP ($ 40 mmHg) was shown to increase the pre-test probability of healing by up to 30% in
one study of low quality.81 There are insufﬁcient data
investigating the relationship between SPP and amputation outcomes to formulate a recommendation.
In summary, when comparing different studies, the ABI
seemed to have the best predictive capacity for major
amputation, while the TP and TcPO2 seemed to have a
better predictive capacity for wound healing. It was noteworthy that there was insufﬁcient evidence for the use of
