 of creating a new classiﬁcation of the threatened lower
extremity that reﬂects these important considerations. We term this new framework, the Society for Vascular Surgery
Lower Extremity Threatened Limb Classiﬁcation System. Risk stratiﬁcation is based on three major factors that impact
amputation risk and clinical management: Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI). The implementation of this
classiﬁcation system is intended to permit more meaningful analysis of outcomes for various forms of therapy in this
challenging, but heterogeneous population. (J Vasc Surg 2014;59:220-34.)

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) was ﬁrst deﬁned in published form in 1982.1 The authors’ expressed intent was
