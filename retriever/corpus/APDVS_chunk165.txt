Note
By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:

Recognize the fundamental types of ionizing radiation.
Understand the sources of radiation in the vascular operating room.
Recognize and practice radiation safety measures.
Recognize adverse outcome of significant radiation exposure.

Key Facts
1. The primary forms of ionizing radiation are alpha particles, beta particles, gamma
rays, and x-rays.
2. In the operating environment, x-rays scatter leading to potential unexpected
exposure.
3. Lead aprons and glasses are important in protecting radiosensitive organs in the
body.
4. Proper shielding, minimizing duration of radiation use, and increasing distance from
the source are important measures to reducing the amount of radiation exposure.
5. The side effects of prolonged radiation exposure to healthcare providers include
various health issues such as cataracts and reproductive dysfunction.
