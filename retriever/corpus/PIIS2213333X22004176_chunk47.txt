care, and high ligation and stripping were not costeffective at the current prices in the U.K. National Health
Service.85 A Canadian cost-analysis study found that RFA
would be w$110 to $220 more expensive than open
surgery but with fewer major and minor early complications (low level of evidence).157
Small saphenous vein. The SSV is one of the important
superﬁcial truncal veins that requires treatment if symptomatic axial reﬂux is document by DU (Fig 2). Data on
the durability of endovenous treatment of the SSV,
however, remain limited. The systematic review by Farah
et al19 included two RCTs, reported in three publications,
that had compared the outcomes after high ligation and
saphenous stripping vs EVLA of the SSV.117,125,126 High
ligation and saphenous stripping was associated with
lower anatomic closure rates and an increased incidence
of minor sensory disturbance at 1 month. At 2 years, the
anatomic closure rate was still superior after EVLA but

with no signiﬁcant differences in clinical recurrence,
sensory disturbance, or any QoL scores between the
groups.117 The use of nonthermal techniques for the
treatment of the SSV appear promising, because
the proximity of the sural nerve can result in neurologic
complications after
open surgery
or
thermal
ablations.158,159 CAC was used to treat SSV insufﬁciency in
163 limbs of 128 patients in a study by Cho et al.160 The
closure rate at 2 years was 96.3%. No major complications, including sural nerve injury, were noted. In a
retrospective study, the results of high ligation and
stripping of the SSV were compared with those after the
MOCA procedure to treat isolated SSV reﬂux.161 The
recurrence rate at 18 months was similar in the two
groups. The MOCA procedure, performed in
