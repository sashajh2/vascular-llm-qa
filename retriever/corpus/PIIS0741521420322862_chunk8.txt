2 decades, paralleling
the larger discipline of vascular surgery, with an increased
emphasis on triphasic multidetector CT arteriography
(CTA) and percutaneous endovascular treatment. CTA is
currently recommended as the ﬁrst-line imaging study
for mesenteric ischemia (both acute and chronic) by the
American College of Radiology Appropriateness criteria
and has largely replaced catheter-based arteriography as
the gold standard for diagnosis.8 It affords the ability to
assess the bowel and other intra-abdominal abdominal
organs as a potential cause of the abdominal pain, in
addition to providing a more comprehensive view of the
extent and distribution of the MAOD and collateral networks. Endovascular treatment with angioplasty and
intraluminal stents has largely replaced open surgical
bypass as the ﬁrst treatment option for mesenteric revascularization. Notably, the number of endovascular procedures for mesenteric ischemia has increased 10-fold over
the past decade and now accounts for more than 70%
of the initial revascularization procedures.6,9,10 This evolution from open to endovascular revascularization has
been justiﬁed by the consistent themes for all endovascular procedures, including excellent technical success and
decreased perioperative complication rates, despite concerns about decreased patency rates and an increased
rate of recurrent symptoms.
The evidence supporting the diagnosis and treatment
for CMI has been somewhat limited, despite the dramatic evolution in the care paradigms over the past decades. The supporting evidence is largely retrospective,
single-center reports with heterogeneous patient populations in terms of comorbidities, distribution of occlusive
disease, acuity of symptoms, and type of revascularization. The limitation of the evidence is compounded by
the lack of widely accepted reporting standards and
the relative low prevalence of the disease process.
These clinical practice guidelines were developed by
the committee under the guidance of the Society for
Vascular Surgery to facilitate evidence-based clinical decision making for patients with CMI. They were limited to
patients with CMI related to atherosclerotic occlusive disease. CMI was deﬁned as ischemic symptoms caused by
insufﬁcient intestinal blood ﬂow to the gastrointestinal
tract for a duration of 3 months as deﬁned by the
