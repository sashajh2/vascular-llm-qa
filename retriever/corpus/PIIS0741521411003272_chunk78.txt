 useful. Endovenous thermal ablation can
also be performed to treat persistent great, small, or accessory saphenous veins or perforators, and foam sclerotherapy
has been used successfully, alone or with phlebectomy, to
treat recurrent varicose veins and perforating veins.227
Phlebectomy alone, without repeat ligation of the saphenous stump, was studied by Pittaluga et al228 for treatment of recurrent varicose veins in 473 limbs. After 3 years
of follow-up, those with phlebectomy alone and those with
phlebectomy and stump ligation had similar rates of freedom from inguinal reflux (90.8% vs 92.9%) and from
varicose repeat-recurrence (90.8% vs 91.9%), suggesting
that the increased complications of groin reoperations can
be avoided in some patients.
In a prospective nonrandomized trial, recurrent varicosity was treated by van Groenendael et al229 in 149 limbs
with open surgery and in 67 with EVLA. Wound infections
(8% vs 0%; P ⬍ .05) and paresthesias (27% vs 13%; P ⬍ .05)
were more frequent in the surgery group, whereas the
EVLA group reported more perioperative pain or tightness
(17% vs 31%; P ⬍ .05). Hospital stay in the surgery group
was longer (P ⬍ .05) as was the delay before resuming work
(7 vs 2 days; P ⬍ .0001). At 25 weeks of follow-up, repeat
recurrences were reported in 29% after surgery and in 19%
after EVLA (P ⫽ .511). Similar results were reported by the

same authors in patients who underwent open surgery or
EVLA for recurrent varicose veins of the SSV.230 These
nonrandomized studies provide only low-quality evidence
that EVLA, when possible to perform, results in lower
complication rates and better socioeconomic outcome in
patients with
