ulcer Skin Management
We suggest application of skin lubricants underneath compression to reduce dermatitis that commonly affects
periulcer skin. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE -C] In severe cases of dermatitis associated with venous leg
ulcers, we suggest topical steroids to reduce the development of secondary ulcerations and to reduce the symptoms
of dermatitis. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 4.17: Anti-inﬂammatory Therapies
We suggest against use of anti-inﬂammatory therapies for the treatment of venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 4.18: Indications for Adjuvant Therapies
We recommend adjuvant wound therapy options for venous leg ulcers that fail to demonstrate improvement
after a minimum of 4 to 6 weeks of standard wound therapy. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 4.19: Split-thickness Skin Grafting
We suggest against split-thickness skin grafting as primary therapy in treatment of venous leg ulcers. [GRADE 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B] We suggest split-thickness skin grafting with continued compression for selected
large venous leg ulcers that have failed to show signs of healing with standard care for 4 to 6 weeks. [GRADE - 2;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 4.20: Cellular Therapy
We suggest the use of cultured allogeneic bilayer skin replacements (with both epidermal and dermal layers) to
increase the chances for healing in patients with difﬁcult to heal venous leg ulcers in addition to compression therapy in patients who have failed to show signs of healing after standard therapy for 4 to 6 weeks. [GRADE - 2;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - A]
Guideline 4.21: Preparation for Cellular Therapy
We suggest a therapeutic trial of appropriate compression and wound bed moisture control before application
of cellular therapy. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C] We recommend that adequate wound bed preparation, including complete removal of slough, debris, and any necrotic tissue, be completed before the application
of a bilayered cellular graft. [GRADE -
