Infection

Yes, cutoffs for CLI;
Category 4: Resting AP <40 mm Hg; Flat or
barely pulsatile ankle or forefoot PVR;
TP <30 mm Hg
Category 5/6: AP <60 mm Hg; ﬂat or
barely pulsatile ankle or forefoot PVR;
TP <40 mm Hg

No

Cutoff values for CLI based on European
consensus document:
Ischemic rest pain >2 weeks with AP <50 mm
Hg or TP <30 mm Hg ulcer and gangrene;
AP <50 mm Hg, TP <30 mm Hg, absent pedal
pulses in patient with diabetes
Yes, 3 grades; CLI cutoff
Grade 1: no PAD symptoms, ABI >0.9, TBI
>0.6, TcPO2 >60 mm Hg;
Grade 2: PAD symptoms, ABI <0.9, AP
>50 mm Hg, TP >30 mm Hg, TcPO2 3060 mm Hg;
Grade 3: AP <50 mm Hg, TP <30 mm Hg,
TcPO2 <30 mm Hg

No

Comments
Pure ischemia model PAD classiﬁcation system
includes milder forms of PAD (categories 1-3);
Categories 4-6 based on cutoff values for CLI;
No spectrum of ischemia, does not
acknowledge potential need for
revascularization with <CLI cutoff depending
on wound extent/infection; Not intended for
patients with diabetes; Wound classes not
sufﬁciently detailed; Omits infection as a trigger
Pure ischemia model; No clear deﬁnitions of
spectrum of hemodynamics; Minimal
description of wounds; Infection omitted

Yes, grades 1-4; see IDSA classiﬁcation (Table II)

Primarily intended for DFUs; Ulcer grades
validated; Includes perfusion assessment,
