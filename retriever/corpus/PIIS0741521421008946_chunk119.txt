Summary and recommendations.
1. Transfemoral CAS should be performed with distal or
proximal protection devices.
2. There is no evidence of superiority of one DEP device
vs the others.
3. There is some evidence that proximal protection offers advantage over DEP by avoiding unprotected
lesion crossing.
4. TCAR with cerebral ﬂow reversal had the lowest reported stroke rate to date compare to all transfemoral
CAS studies.
Timing of PTA during stenting. A key step during CAS,
percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) can be performed after establishing distal or proximal protection.
Both prestent and poststent deployment PTA can be
performed. Pre-dilatation allows the stent delivery system to be advanced without being constrained or trapped. In pre-PTA, a balloon with 2- to 4-mm diameter and
15- to 20-mm length is used to prepare a stenosed vessel
for stent deployment. However, predilatation might increase the risk for embolic stroke. Risk of perioperative
stroke in the CAPTURE study was signiﬁcantly higher in
patients with pre-PTA vs without PTA (OR, 3.68, 95% CI,
2.26-6.0, P < .001).198 However, a real-world analysis of all
CAS cases in the VQI database between 2005 and 2016
showed a similar risk of stroke and death after primary
CAS without angioplasty compared with conventional
CAS with angioplasty, as long as an EPD is used.389
Balloon inﬂation should, therefore, be slow, bearing in
mind not to exceed the nominal pressure, which is then
followed by immediate gradual deﬂation. This practice
helps to prevent negative pressure formation and helps
to minimize embolic showering.
In contrast, post-PTA is largely user dependent. It is
commonly used to mitigate residual stenosis after stent
deployment. However, post-PTA is associated with an
