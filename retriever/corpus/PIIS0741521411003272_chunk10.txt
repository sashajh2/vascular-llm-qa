 recommend against selective treatment of incompetent
perforating veins in patients with simple varicose veins (CEAP class
C2).
We suggest treatment of “pathologic” perforating veins that includes
those with an outward flow duration of ⱖ500 ms, with a diameter
of ⱖ3.5 mm, located beneath a healed or open venous ulcer
(CEAP class C5-C6).
For treatment of “pathologic” perforating veins, we suggest
subfascial endoscopic perforating vein surgery, ultrasonographically
guided sclerotherapy, or thermal ablations.
14. Treatment of pelvic varicose veins
We recommend noninvasive imaging with transabdominal and/or
transvaginal ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic
resonance venography in selected patients with symptoms of pelvic
congestion syndrome or symptomatic varices in the distribution of
the pubis, labia, perineum, or buttocks.
We recommend retrograde ovarian and internal iliac venography in
patients with pelvic venous disease, confirmed or suspected by
noninvasive imaging studies, in whom an intervention is planned.
We suggest treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome and pelvic
varices with coil embolization, plugs, or transcatheter
sclerotherapy, used alone or together.
If less invasive treatment is not available or has failed, we suggest
surgical ligation and excision of ovarian veins to treat reflux.

INTRODUCTION
In the United States, an estimated 23% of adults have
varicose veins, and 6% have more advanced chronic venous
disease (CVD), including skin changes and healed or active
venous ulcers.1 Varicose veins have long been considered a
cosmetic problem that only affected emotional well-being
but were not the
