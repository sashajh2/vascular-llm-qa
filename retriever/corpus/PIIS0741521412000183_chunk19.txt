cate 60% to 64% of cases of PCD52,54 and occurs when
extensive venous thrombosis, most often at the iliofemoral
level, leads to profound venous hypertension and small
arterial collapse once critical closing pressures are exceeded
by the surrounding tissue pressure.56 Calf compartment
pressures of ⱖ50 mm Hg have been documented in association with PCD.53,57
Unfortunately, the literature regarding venous gangrene
is fragmented, with the surgical literature emphasizing the
mechanical consequences of venous outflow obstruction and
the medical literature largely focusing on microvascular mechanisms. Venous gangrene may be associated with profound
imbalances of the procoagulant–anticoagulant systems, particularly in the setting of underlying malignancy or heparininduced thrombocytopenia, both of which are common underlying causes.54,58,59 Venous gangrene in these situations is
often associated with the initiation of warfarin and results from
a combination of profound hypercoagulability and concurrent
protein C depletion.60 However, it is unclear how much
overlap there is between reports of venous gangrene arising
from extensive venous outflow obstruction and those related
to an underlying procoagulant–anticoagulant imbalance. The
development of limb-threatening venous ischemia may thus
be multifactorial, related to elevated venous pressures as well
as profound procoagulant–anticoagulant imbalances. Regardless of the mechanism, venous gangrene is associated with
death in one-third or more of patients and high rates of
amputation.52,54,57,59
