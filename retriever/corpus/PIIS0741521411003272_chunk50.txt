min, hesperidin, rutosides, sulodexide, micronized
purified flavonoid fraction, or horse chestnut seed extract [aescin]) for patients
with pain and swelling due to chronic venous disease, in countries where these
drugs are available.
We suggest using pentoxifylline or micronized purified flavonoid fraction, if
available, in combination with compression, to accelerate healing of venous ulcers.

of compression treatment is to compensate for the increased ambulatory venous hypertension. Pressures to
compress the superficial veins in supine patients range from
20 to 25 mm Hg. When upright, pressures of 35 to 40 mm
Hg have been shown to narrow the superficial veins, and
pressures â¬Ž60 mm Hg are needed to occlude them.139
Varicose veins (CEAP class C2). Reported case series
of patients treated with elastic stockings frequently included the whole spectrum of patients with CVD (CEAP
class C0-C6). Treatment with 30 to 40 mm Hg compression stockings in 112 patients (82% with varicose veins, 52%
with edema, and 7% with healed or active ulcers) resulted in
marked improvement in pain, swelling, skin pigmentation,
activity, and well-being at 16 months after initiation of
therapy, with compliance of 70%.140
A large systematic review of compression hosiery for
uncomplicated simple varicose veins was recently published
by Palfreyman and Michaels.34 They analyzed data of 11
prospective RCTs or systematic reviews, 12 nonrandomized studies, and 2 guidelines. Although compression improved symptoms, the study concluded that evidence is
lacking to support compression garments to decrease progression or to prevent recurrence of varicose veins after
treatment. However, these results could have been confounded by the high number of noncompliant patients
included in these studies.34
The level of compression for patients with class C2
disease is also disputed. A meta-analysis by Amsler and
Blattler141 of 11 RCTs suggested that in healthy patients,
in those with C1 to C3 disease, and in those after
