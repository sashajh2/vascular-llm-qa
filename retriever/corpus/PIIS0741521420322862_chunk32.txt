 to their advanced comorbidities
and/or personal preference.
The SMA is the most important of the three mesenteric
vessels given the extent of its distribution to the bowel
and is the primary target for revascularization. The crucial
role of the SMA is indirectly supported by the overall better symptomatic relief noted when the SMA is revascularized, regardless of what other combination of vessels are
treated or whether performed by an open or endovascular approach. Notably, Goldman et al91 compared the
outcomes associated with the endovascular treatment
of CA alone vs SMA alone or the latter in combination
with the CA. They found that the treatment of the CA
alone was associated with the highest rate of symptomatic recurrence and concluded that the SMA was the key
determinant of successful revascularization.
Isolated revascularization of the CA or IMA may be justiﬁed in select patients when the SMA is not suitable for
revascularization. The characteristics of the SMA that
affect treatment selection include vessel diameter,
extent of stenosis or occlusion, presence of tandem lesions, degree of calciﬁcation, and the extent of collateralization. Admittedly, most of these concerns are more
relevant for endovascular revascularization, because it is
usually possible to identify a suitable distal target in
either the SMA or CA for open revascularization. Several
recent studies have reported that endovascular revascularization of the SMA is possible for long segment occlusions and/or severe calciﬁcations.33,92,93 Endovascular
revascularization of the CA with an intraluminal stent is
associated with a high risk of restenosis94 and is relatively
contraindicated if there is signiﬁcant compression by the

median arcuate ligament, although it is feasible to
release the median arcuate ligament with either a laparoscopic or open surgical approach. The reported experience with isolated IMA revascularization for the
treatment for CMI is limited to relatively small case series
and the outcomes have been somewhat equivocal.95,96
The isolated endovascular revascularization of the CA or
IMA in the setting of a severely disease SMA may be
considered as a bridge to open bypass or retrograde
SMA stenting.97
