 revascularization. Direct open cervical access of the CCA offers the advantage of avoiding the
atherosclerotic arch and crossing the major vessels. It can
be performed under general, regional or local anesthesia
with conscious sedation. Preoperative duplex ultrasound
examination and/or CTA is needed to evaluate the CCA
and its bifurcations. The proximal cervical CCA must be
free of severe calciÔ¨Åcation and atheroma. A minimal 6mm luminal diameter is required. Proper distance between the clavicle and bifurcation (5-cm landing zone) is
required for TCAR. The depth of the CCA should be also
evaluated. The ratio of depth/landing zone should be less
than 1:2. In anatomies where the ratio is greater than one,
TCAR is not recommended. Details of this technique have
been described elsewhere.379 In brief, a 2- to 4-cm transverse or longitudinal incision is made in the triangle between the two heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle
and clavicle. The proximal CCA is dissected free and vessel
loop or umbilical tape is placed proximally. A purse-string
or U 5.0 Prolene pre-suture is placed and the CCA is
punctured directly with a 21G micropuncture needle. Using
a standard approach, the CCA access is secured and placed

at a 45 angle, and a 0.018-inch soft tip microwire is
advanced 3 to 4 cm into the external carotid artery. Next, a
5F soft microsheath is placed only 2 cm into the CCA over
the microwire. The microwire and dilator are removed and
a cervical carotid angiography with road mapping or fade
in and out digital subtraction is performed with different
oblique views to delineate the bifurcation. If the external
carotid artery is open with no lesion at the bifurcation, the
wire is advanced into ECA followed by the 5-F microsheath
with dilator (ECA engaging technique). The
