needed, over ligation and stripping of the accessory
GSV because of less early pain and morbidity and an
earlier return to regular activity.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak), quality of
evidence: C (low to very low)
Rationale. All the treatment modalities discussed in
this section can be used to successfully treat symptomatic reﬂux of the GSV (Fig 1). Surgical treatment includes high ligation of the GSV or SSV at the SFJ or at the
SPJ, respectively, and invagination stripping of the distal
portion of the vein with the patient under general
anesthesia or tumescent local anesthesia.
