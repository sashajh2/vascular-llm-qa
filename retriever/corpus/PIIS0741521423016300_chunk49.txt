SA Guidelines on Management of Diabetic Foot Infections.104 In a person with a
foot abscess or infection of a deep foot compartment
that needs immediate drainage, or where there is
gangrene that must be removed to control the infection,
immediate surgery should be considered ﬁrst.104 This
should be accompanied by broad spectrum antibiotic
therapy, which is subsequently tailored according to tissue culture results, as “time is tissue” in these people.
Once the sepsis is controlled and the person is stabilised,
evaluation of the arterial tree should lead to consideration for prompt revascularisation (i.e., within a few
days) in people with substantial perfusion deﬁcits. Once
blood ﬂow is improved and infection is controlled, a
deﬁnitive operation may be required to create a functional foot, which may require soft tissue and bone

reconstruction.105 Due to the risk of amputation in this
clinical scenario, the likelihood that the person will value
avoidance of amputation, and the need for appropriate
prioritisation of intervention strategies to achieve this,
the Writing Committee formulated a Best Practice
Statement.

Recommendation 15
In a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer, when the wound
deteriorates or fails to signiﬁcantly improve (e.g., a less than
50% reduction in wound area within four weeks) despite
appropriate infection and glucose control, wound care, and
ofﬂoading, reassess the vascular status and consult with a
vascular specialist regarding possible revascularisation.
