 has been documented.169 Examples of CTArelevant ﬁndings that are important to note if CA
coverage is planned include signiﬁcant stenosis of the
SMA, occluded inferior mesenteric artery, large poststenotic dilation of the CA, and inability to visualize the
pancreaticoduodenal or dorsal pancreatic branches.
CTA alone may predict ischemia after CA coverage and
the need for CA revascularization through open (traditional open surgical management) or endovascular interventions (such as parallel [“snorkel”] stents or
fenestrations, given appropriate investigational device
exemption and local experience). However, CTA does
not demonstrate dynamic ﬂow and has been proved to
be incorrect as a single imaging modality in predicting
safe coverage of the CA after TEVAR by some
authors.170,171
If CA coverage occurs without revascularization, a high
degree of suspicion for ischemic complications should
be maintained postoperatively. Furthermore, ischemia
symptoms can range from mild reversible abdominal
pain to mild liver enzyme elevation to lethal ischemic
injury of the foregut, spleen, or liver. Balloon occlusion
has been reported by some in a small number of cases
(n ¼ 5 each) to determine suitability for CA coverage,
with unclear sensitivity and speciﬁcity.172 Thus, although
it is reasonable in cases in which the results from mesenteric angiography are equivocal, no strong recommendation can be made.
The largest series of CA coverage included only 31 cases.
The protocol was to evaluate CTA for collaterals and, if absent, to perform SMA angiography to evaluate for retrograde ﬂow into the celiac branches. If absent, the CA was
occluded with a balloon and the imaging repeated.
Notably, the authors aggressively and pre-emptively
treated SMA stenosis or cases in which partial SMA
coverage occurred during TEVAR (39% of cases) with
balloon-expandable stents. They documented one case
of lethal hepatic ischemia (despite subsequent open
bypass), one case of acalculous cholecystitis, and one
case of sigmoid colon ischemia thought to be embolic.173
Another study evaluated 18 TEVAR cases
