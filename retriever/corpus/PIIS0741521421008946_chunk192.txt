6 $2170 (P < .001), respectively.662 The
largest single institution study reported to date included
174 patients who underwent CEA and 132 patients who
underwent CAS. Data showed that mean hospital costs
were $9426 6 5775 for CAS and $6734 6 3935 for CEA
(P < .0001). As in other reports, the major driver of this differential was supply costs which were $5634 for CAS vs
$1967 for CEA (P < .0001). Hospital length of stay was
2.1 days for both groups.663
Population database analyses provide generally comparable results. In the most recent analysis from the Premier
Perspective Database that used propensity score matching, total hospital costs among asymptomatic patients
were 40% higher for CAS compared with CEA ($11,814 vs
$8378; P < .001); and 37% higher among symptomatic patients $19,426 vs $14,190; P < .001).664 These ﬁndings parallel an earlier study from the National Inpatient Sample of
404,256 patients who underwent either CEA or CAS from
2005 through 2007. Median charges were signiﬁcantly
higher for patients who underwent CAS (P < .0001).1
Conversely, a recent meta-analysis of 17 studies found
that procedure costs were 51% higher for CAS compared

with CEA, largely owing to the costs of devices and supplies. However, costs of the index admission in total were
comparable owing to higher postprocedure CEA costs.665
The relative costs of CAS and CEA will clearly impact
hospital proﬁtability. An analysis of the National Inpatient
Sample from 2001 through 2008 identiﬁed 181,200 CEA
and 12,485 CAS procedures. Median costs for uncomplicated CEA and CAS cases were $1466 and $3272 higher
than the average Medicare reimbursement, respectively.
