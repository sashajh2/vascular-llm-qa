, costeffectiveness analysis can reveal the value of different
treatment options and also allow comparison to other
treatments in other ﬁelds. Early Markov decision analysis
models show that EVAR is cost-effective compared with
open repair, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
of $22,826.764 However, contemporary Markov models using data from the DREAM,765 EVAR 1,682 OVER,766 and
ACE362 randomized trials showed EVAR to be costeffective on the basis of the OVER trial data, but no difference in lifetime cost-effectiveness was derived from data
generated by the European trials, suggesting that results
may not be generalizable among different countries.767
EVAR also does not appear to be cost-effective for treatment of complicated aneurysms. Cost comparisons for
fenestrated or branched EVAR graft demonstrated higher
costs in comparison to open repair (38,212 vs 16,497)
without signiﬁcant differences in 30-day mortality.768
Most of the data for cost-effectiveness pertain to elective cases, for which expected morbidity and mortality
can be managed through selection of patients and preparation. In the urgent and emergent situation, morbidity
and mortality risk is higher, leading to higher costs and
lower quality of life. Nevertheless, evidence suggests
that EVAR in the acute setting is favorable.769
A single screening ultrasound for AAA in asymptomatic
men older than 65 years has been shown to be costeffective in the United Kingdom261 and through Markov
modeling.770 In the United Kingdom, the cost per lifeyear saved with screening was $1173, which is less costly
than screening programs for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer.771 The cost-effectiveness of screening for
younger cohorts, women, and reimaging intervals for
small aneurysms remains uncertain. Early treatment of
a small aneurysm, <5 cm in diameter, is not costeffective in comparison to serial imaging.772
Because of the lower perioperative complication rates
with EVAR, patients who could not undergo open repair
are being offered EVAR or hybrid procedures. In the
setting of constrained costs and capitated care,
