perioperative morbidity and mortality rate of 13.9%
and 3.5%, respectively, and a 10-year survival and primary
patency rate of 88% and 84%, respectively. Oderich et al6
compared the outcomes of 229 consecutive patients undergoing revascularization for CMI (open, 146; endovascular, 83) and reported that the perioperative morbidity
(36% vs 18%; P ¼ .001) and hospital length of stay (12 6
8 days vs 3 6 5 days; P ¼ .001) were higher for the open
group, although there was no difference in perioperative
mortality (open, 2.7% vs endovascular, 2.4%). The 5-year
survival (72 6 5% vs 55 6 9%; P < .0001), freedom from
recurrent symptoms (89 6 4% vs 51 6 9%), and primary
patency rates (88 6 2% vs 41 6 9%) were all higher in
the open group. Similarly, Zacharias et al114 compared
their outcomes after open (n ¼ 45) and endovascular
(n ¼ 116) repair and reported that the hospital length of

stay (5 6 8 days vs 23 6 20 days; P < .001) was lower in
the endovascular group, but there was no difference in
the perioperative mortality rate (endovascular, 5.2% vs
open, 11%). The 3-year primary patency rates were higher
in the open group (91% vs 74%; P ¼ .18), although the survival was lower (78% vs 95%; P ¼ .003). These ﬁndings are
underscored by the fact that there has been a shift in the
patient cohort undergoing open revascularization since
the introduction of the endovascular therapies, reﬂected
