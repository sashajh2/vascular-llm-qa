Key Question 4. Incompetent perforators ablation vs no
ablation
We included two RCTs.112,113 The two RCTs had an intermediate risk of bias. The studies reported on 141 patients
(mean age, 50 years; 49% women) with CEAP classes
C0 to C5. One of the studies112 randomized 72 patients
(C0-C5) to saphenofemoral ligation and stripping with
subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery and concomitant phlebectomy or to saphenofemoral ligation and
stripping with concomitant phlebectomy. There were
no statistically signiﬁcant differences between the two
groups up to 1 year regarding pain, mobility, or QoL
scores. A signiﬁcantly greater proportion of patients in
the no subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery group
had incompetent perforator veins on duplex imaging
at 1 year (25 of 32 vs 12 of 38; P < .001). However, clinical
recurrence was similar in both groups at 1 year
(Supplementary Table VII, online only). Another study113
randomized 69 patients (C2-C3) with varicose veins and
incompetent thigh perforators to saphenous ablation
with or without perforator ablation. Adding perforator
ablation resulted in similar clinical results and complications (bruising, ecchymosis, edema, and paresthesia)
than saphenous ablation alone. There was no statistically
signiﬁcant difference in anatomic closure of the treated
GSV at 1 month or 1 year.
No studies exclusively evaluated patients with simple
varicose veins (CEAP class C2) only, although the majority

of patients in the three studies were C2 patients. Data on
perforator ablation alone without saphenous ablation in
C2 patients were not available.
Saphenous ablation without or with concomitant
treatment
