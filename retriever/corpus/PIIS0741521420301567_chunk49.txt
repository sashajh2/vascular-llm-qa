two reported series.111,114

Although they were once thought to be uncommon,
CAAs are being diagnosed with increasing frequency
with the use of advanced imaging techniques.82,83 The
increasing diagnosis of incidental visceral aneurysms in
the United States is primarily related to the liberal use
of cross-sectional imaging studies.84 Most visceral aneurysms currently are detected incidentally during diagnostic imaging performed for other indications.83
Whereas plain radiography, ultrasound, CT, MRA, and
arteriography have identiﬁed CAAs, CTA remains the
initial diagnostic and evaluative tool of choice.83
Besides being able to assess the location and size of the
CAA, CTA may also reveal rupture, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, and associated underlying diseases as well as
celiac axis stenosis, which should be systematically evaluated on axial imaging of patients with CAAs. In addition,
nearly all necessary data for planning endovascular treatment can be obtained by multidimensional CTA.83

Ultrasound examination of visceral vessels is inhibited by
shadowing from bowel gas as well as by obesity; however, its sensitivity to detect CAA of <3 cm is poor.83,85 MRA
may certainly play a role in patients in whom CTA is contraindicated. However, in 2006, Pilleul et al86 compared
the use of MRA and CTA for the analysis of splanchnic aneurysms and believed that the sensitivity of MRA was
suboptimal in the case of small aneurysms.
Formal arteriography may rarely be necessary for preinterventional planning when noninvasive studies have not
sufﬁciently demonstrated the status of relevant anatomy
or collateral blood ﬂow. However, it is most frequently
performed at the time of a planned endovascular
intervention.

that CAAs after spontaneous dissection behave differently,
and no distinct recommendation for this subgroup can be
made. Similarly, patients with post-sten
