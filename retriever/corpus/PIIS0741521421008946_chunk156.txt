 prospective study has compared
treatment options for in-stent restenosis. The choice
should therefore be made on a case-by-case basis with
careful analysis of lesion features and the patient’s proﬁle.
In the future, adequately powered trials using a uniform
deﬁnition and standardized workup for in-stent restenosis are s necessary to determine the appropriateness of
interventions for in-stent restenosis.
According to the available literature, in-stent restenosis
can be successfully treated with surgical interventions
(endarterectomy with stent removal in some cases) as
well as with endovascular techniques.472 Tight management of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking cessation
remain potent targets for preventing and improving outcomes for patients with in-stent restenosis.473 However,
medical therapy alone should be chosen only in asymptomatic patients and patients with high-risk lesions
where invasive treatment is high-risk based on the patient’s clinical status and comorbidities.
Endovascular treatment, such as PTA with simple
balloon, cutting-balloon, drug-eluting balloon, and stenting, is recommended as the ﬁrst choice wherever
possible, mainly because it is the less invasive option
and has good results. Although PTA is a common treatment for in-stent restenosis, recurrent restenosis seems
to limit the durability, leading to recurrent interventions
and associated cost implications.472 An analysis of the
VQI database showed no signiﬁcant differences in 1year stroke, death, and stroke/death between primary
CAS and redo CAS. Moreover, the odds of bradycardia
and hypotension were lower after redo CAS compared
with primary CAS.434 Drug-eluting techniques are
emerging and may become the preferred treatment option, but long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate their
efﬁcacy.472
In contrast, CEA should be avoided in asymptomatic
patients with serious systemic disease. Analysis of 645 patients with in-stent restenosis in the VQI database
