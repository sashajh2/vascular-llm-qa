 studies have
revealed the prevalence of carotid stenosis in patients
with AAAs to be <20%.118 Clearly, the correlation of carotid atherosclerosis with isolated abdominal aneurysmal disease is not thought to be as signiﬁcant as the
relationship with coronary and lower extremity atherosclerotic occlusive disease. Therefore, routine screening
for carotid stenosis in asymptomatic patients with AAAs
but without other deﬁned high-risk factors is not
recommended.119
Patients with clinically occult cerebral infarction or
high-risk factors on brain imaging. Finally, asymptomatic patients in whom brain imaging has identiﬁed cerebral infarction despite the absence of any corresponding
history of neurologic symptoms represent a population
that might beneﬁt from imaging of the carotid artery.
An increased subsequent stroke rate of 4.4% in patients
with 60% to 79% initially asymptomatic stenosis has
been reported if a silent infarct was identiﬁed on brain
imaging studies.120 Therefore, screening is generally recommended for patients with asymptomatic cerebral
infarctions.120 The detection of cerebral emboli using
transcranial Doppler (TCD) studies also had a high positive predictive value to identify asymptomatic patients at
high risk of stroke. The patients with two or more
microemboli per hour on TCD studies had a markedly

increased risk of 1-year ipsilateral ischemic stroke
compared with patients with asymptomatic carotid
stenosis without TCD-detected microemboli (15.6% vs
1.0%, respectively; P < .0001).121 However, at present, it is
unclear how this technology might be practically applied
to all asymptomatic patients with known carotid
stenosis.
Recommendation 4.2 In selected asymptomatic patients who are at an increased risk of carotid stenosis,
we suggest screening for clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, especially if patients are willing
to consider carotid intervention if signiﬁcant stenosis
is discovered (grade 2B). These high-risk groups include
