 that the risk of periprocedural events after CEA or CAS might be increased
in patients presenting with severe comorbid conditions,
including dialysis-dependent renal failure, New York
Heart Association functional class III or IV heart disease, a
left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%, class III
or IV angina pectoris, left main or multivessel coronary
disease, severe aortic valvular disease, oxygen- or steroiddependent pulmonary disease, contralateral carotid occlusion, and advanced age. However, few data exist to
support one therapy over another in these patients.7,185 In
fact, deﬁning a high-risk patient is much more subjective
than deﬁning a high-risk lesion.182,183,186,187 CAS is associated with a lower risk of cardiac events than CEA.
Assuming appropriate anatomy for either procedure,
CAS is therefore preferred over CEA when severe cardiac
comorbidities exist in neurologically symptomatic
patients.
Chronic renal insufﬁciency has been associated with
increased risk of stroke and death after transfemoral
CAS188,189 and CEA.190,191 Univariate and multivariate analyses both show that among patients with chronic kidney disease, 6-month risk of death, stroke, and MI after
transfemoral CAS were associated with HRs of greater
than 2.5.188 Chronic renal insufﬁciency also increases
the risk of stroke after CEA (1.08%-5.56%). Among asymptomatic patients with cardiac or renal insufﬁciency, best

medical therapy may be preferable to transfemoral
CAS or CEA. CEA or transfemoral CAS may be considered
among symptomatic high-risk patients with moderate
to severe carotid stenosis, but the effectiveness over
medical therapy is not well-established.
There are conﬂicting data on the inﬂuence of contralateral occlusion on CEA or transfemoral CAS outcomes.
NASCET reported that a contralateral occlusion
increased risk of stroke after CEA from 5.8% to approximately 14%.33 However, most reports on contralateral occlusion do not support this observation, and a metaanalysis
