 In the absence of a smoking history, the
prevalence drops to 2%. The prevalence of AAA is 0.8%
in a similar age group of women who have a past history
of smoking, but for women who are current smokers, the
prevalence is 2%. In women who have never smoked,
AAA prevalence is <0.60%.254
In 2007, following passage of the Screening Abdominal
Aortic Aneurysms Very Efﬁciently (SAAAVE) amendment
in 2006, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began offering one-time screening by ultrasound
for men aged 65 to 75 years if they had smoked $100 cigarettes in their lifetime and for men and women with a
family history of AAA disease as part of their Welcome
to Medicare physical examination. As originally
mandated, the screening could be ordered only by the
primary care physician within 6 months of the activation
of Medicare beneﬁts.253 However, by 2012, it was

apparent that <3% of abdominal ultrasound claims were
for SAAAVE-speciﬁc AAA screening, and although
abdominal ultrasound examinations in the affected age
groups had increased, there was no discernible effect
on AAA rupture or all-cause mortality.255 Subsequent
Medicare eligibility guidelines have been modiﬁed to
allow additional physician specialists to order the tests
and to increase the window of eligibility.
Many additional opportunities exist to improve
screening and surveillance practices in the United States.
Currently, 40% of operative repairs in Medicare beneﬁciaries are performed late in the course of the disease,
suggesting that a prior screening opportunity had been
missed.256 A signiﬁcant portion of patients present with
rupture despite known AAA status.256 In an analysis of a
cohort of >3 million individuals, it was suggested that
small changes in recommended eligibility requirements,
such as accounting for the impact of accumulated cardiovascular risk factors, would improve the screening
yield for women, nonsmokers, and other groups traditionally considered at lower risk.33
