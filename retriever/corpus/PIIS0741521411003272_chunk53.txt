 a fact supported by data of the REACTIV
trial. In addition, some patients, such as the obese or the
elderly, may have difficulties applying an elastic stockings.138 One study of predominantly elderly (mean age, 72
years) women with CVD found that 15% could not apply
elastic stockings and 26% needed considerable help to do
so.145 On the basis of the available evidence, the Guideline
Committee recommends against compression therapy being considered the primary treatment of symptomatic varicose veins (class C2) in those patients who are candidates
for saphenous vein ablation (GRADE 1B).
CVI (CEAP classes C3-C6). Compression therapy
remains the standard of care for patients with advanced
CVD and venous ulcers (class C3-C6). Compression therapy improves calf muscle pump function and decreases
reflux in vein segments in patients with CVI.146,147 In
patients with venous ulcers, graded compression is effective
as the primary treatment to aid healing of venous ulceration
and as adjuvant therapy to interventions to prevent recurrence of venous ulcers.148
Compliance with compression therapy is important. In
a cohort study by Mayberry et al,148 results of venous ulcer
treatment in 113 patients treated over 15 years were reported. Ulcer healing with local care and compression
averaged 5.3 months, and was 97% in compliant patients
and 55% in noncompliant patients (P ‚¨ç .0001). Ulcer
recurrence was 16% in compliant patients and 100% in
noncompliant patients.
A systematic review of 24 RCTs on compression treatment on venous ulcers by Fletcher et al36 concluded that
compression treatment improves the healing of ulcers compared with no compression149 and that high compression is
more effective than low compression.150 The authors
found no evidence that one form of compression treatment
is better than another, although a previously published
single-center experience suggested that low-stretch inelastic bandages were more effective in reducing venous reflux
than elastic bandages.151 The ACCP guidelines suggest the
use of an ICP in addition
