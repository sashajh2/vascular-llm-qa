juvant treatment to superficial
vein ablation for the prevention of ulcer recurrence.
10. Open venous surgery
For treatment of the incompetent great saphenous vein, we suggest
high ligation and inversion stripping of the saphenous vein to the
level of the knee.
To reduce hematoma formation, pain, and swelling, we recommend
postoperative compression. The recommended period of
compression in C2 patients is 1 week.

Guideline title
For treatment of small saphenous vein incompetence, we recommend
high ligation of the vein at the knee crease, about 3 to 5 cm distal
to the saphenopopliteal junction, with selective invagination
stripping of the incompetent portion of the vein.
To decrease recurrence of venous ulcers, we recommend ablation of
the incompetent superficial veins in addition to compression
therapy.
We suggest preservation of the saphenous vein using the ambulatory
conservative hemodynamic treatment of varicose veins (CHIVA)
technique only selectively in patients with varicose veins, when
performed by trained venous interventionists.
We suggest preservation of the saphenous vein using the ambulatory
selective varicose vein ablation under local anesthesia (ASVAL)
procedure only selectively in patients with varicose veins.
We recommend ambulatory phlebectomy for treatment of varicose
