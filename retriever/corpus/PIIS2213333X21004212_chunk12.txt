of interest. We used a modiﬁed version of the NewcastleOttawa scale for observational studies,18 focusing on the
exposed cohort’s representativeness and nonexposed
cohort, ascertainment of exposure and outcomes,
comparability of cohorts, and adequacy of follow-up. For
diagnostic tests, we used QUADAS-2 (A Revised Tool for
the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies)19;
this tool considers four key domains, namely, patient
