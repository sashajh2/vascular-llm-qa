neurologically symptomatic patients. EVA-3S showed a
statistically inferior outcome for CAS compared with CEA
(stroke death, 9.5% vs 3.8%) in these patients. This study
was criticized because of the relatively low level of experience (minimum of 25 CAS cases) required in the CAS arm.
The Stent-Supported Percutaneous Angioplasty of the
Carotid Artery versus Endarterectomy (SPACE) trial was
designed to test “equivalence” between CEA and CAS in

e18 Ricotta et al

patients with neurologic symptoms. This trial stopped after
recruitment of 1200 patients due to the futility of proving
equivalence between the two treatments. The rate of death
or ipsilateral stroke at 30 days was 6.84% for CAS and 6.34%
for CEA in 1183 randomized patients. However, the study
was not powered appropriately and failed to show noninferiority of CAS compared with CEA (P ⫽ .09).
Subsequently the International Carotid Stenting Study
Trial (ICST),10 which enrolled 1713 patients, demonstrated an increased stroke risk for CAS (7.7%) compared
with CEA (4.1%) in neurologically symptomatic patients.
This observed difference was significant (P ⫽ .002). The
rate of any stroke or death ⱕ30 days of treatment in the
stenting group was more than twice the rate the rate
recorded in the endarterectomy group (7.4% vs 3.4%, P ⫽
.0004). In addition, the composite end point of stroke,
death, and MI significantly favored CEA (5.2%) vs CAS
(8.5%; P ⫽ .006). It is of interest to note that the authors of
this trial highlight the fact that they observed a higher rate
of fatal MIs with CAS than with CEA. This observation has
not been confirmed in other large studies, including
CREST, and in meta-analysis, where the incidence of MI is
higher in the CEA group.11
