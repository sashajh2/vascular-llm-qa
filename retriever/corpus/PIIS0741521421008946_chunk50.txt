0 years.5 This was conﬁrmed in a metaanalysis of four randomized trials comparing CEA and
transfemoral CAS.199 Similarly, a study by Hicks et al200
using VQI data demonstrated a higher risk of stroke
and death in patients meeting Medicare high-risk criteria
(HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.05-2.60; P ¼ .03) undergoing transfemoral CAS vs CEA.
High risk for TCAR.
Hostile nonvascular anatomy. Although similar to
CEA, several anatomic considerations that may increase
the difﬁculty of CEA may not be as prohibitive for
TCAR. For example, if the proximal CCA is not exposed
during the primary CEA, there may be no increased risk
for TCAR in the treatment of carotid restenosis after
CEA. Additionally, because the magnitude of surgical
exposure is less than standard CEA (carotid bifurcation
exposure), exposure of the proximal CCA is not as prone
to nerve injury. Nonetheless, cervical stoma, history of
neck radiotherapy with resultant local ﬁbrotic changes
of the skin and soft tissues, and previous ablative neck
surgery, such as radical neck dissection and laryngectomy,171,182-184 would be relative contraindications for
TCAR. Similar to CEA, TCAR can be performed successfully in these situations. However, it can be associated
with an increased risk of wound infection, difﬁculty of
dissection, and potentially, the incidence of vagus nerve
injury (group consensus).
Neurologic symptoms.
Symptomatic with a greater than 50% ICA stenosis.
CEA in symptomatic stenosis. Both NASCET and ECST
demonstrated the beneﬁt of CEA in neurologically symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis that reduced
diameter of greater than 50%.28,37,168 NASCET demonstrated an absolute risk reduction of stroke of 17% at
2 years (24% in medical arm vs 7% in surgical arm) for
patients with a greater than 70% car
