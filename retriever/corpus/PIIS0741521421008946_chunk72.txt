 1.80; 95% CI, 1.671.93; P < .001). These authors noted that differences
were clinically irrelevant, because the overall risk of cardiac adverse events after CEA was low. Others felt that
the approach to choosing anesthesia for CEA should be
based on patient risk factors and preference, and by
the team’s experience.239-241
Local and regional anesthesia and the use of antiplatelet agents. Because many patients who undergo
CEA take aspirin antiplatelet monotherapy and some
also take dual antiplatelet therapy, there is some concern

about hematoma formation. In a systemic review of 10,081
patients in 69 studies, the combined superﬁcial and deep
cervical plexus blockade was associated with a signiﬁcantly higher risk of major complications (OR, 2.13; P ¼
.006), when compared with superﬁcial/intermediate
blockade.224 Most of the major complications reported
were inadvertent intravascular injection and respiratory
distress or failure secondary to phrenic nerve and/or
recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis. In most scenarios, the
general guidelines recommend cessation of antiplatelet
therapy, speciﬁcally clopidogrel, whenever possible.242
Presently, there are no published guidelines regarding
whether it is safe to perform deep cervical plexus
blockade in CEA patients who are taking dual antiplatelet
therapy.243 Therefore, because many symptomatic patients will undergo CEA while on dual antiplatelet therapy,
surgeons and anesthesiologists who perform this procedure must consider the risks and beneﬁts of doing surgery
under regional/local anesthesia while the patient is on
perioperative antiplatelet therapy. It is generally not recommended to stop antiplatelet therapy and/or delay
CEA for the usual recommendation of 7 days, as this may
increase the risk of early recurrent embolic stroke.
Summary and recommendations. The choice of anesthesia local/regional vs general anesthesia is equivalent
and should be left to surgeon’s/anesthesiologist’s preference because both techniques have
