 receiving immunomodulatory therapy after major organ transplantation.61-63
Women who smoke are at high risk for an AAA. In a
recent Swedish population study, women with a history
of smoking of >20 pack-years were nearly twice as likely

to develop AAA as men with a similar smoking history.64
However, the risk of AAA after smoking cessation
declines more rapidly in women than in men.64
Increased aortic mural calciﬁcation has also been
suggested as a risk factor for rupture.65
Rupture risk for those unﬁt for repair in the Aneurysm
Detection and Management (ADAM) trial was 9% per
year for patients with aortic diameters between 5.5
and 5.9 cm, 10% for aneurysms between 6.0 and 6.9
cm, and 33% for those $7.0 cm.66 More recent experience suggests that rupture estimates based on aortic
diameter may need revision downward. Pooled analysis
from natural history studies and control arms of interventional trials indicate that current rupture risk may
be as low as 5.3% per year for AAAs between 5.5 and
7.0 cm in diameter and 6.3% per year for AAAs >7.0
cm. Among asymptomatic patients, the risk of death
from causes other than AAA, regardless of aneurysm
diameter, was higher than the risk of death from aneurysm rupture.67
Careful review of the surgical history is also essential for
accurate and timely recognition of AAA disease. Cholecystitis, appendicitis, or pancreatitis may mimic the
presentation of a symptomatic aneurysm. In addition,
the nature and extent of previous abdominal surgery
may inﬂuence the operative approach. When a pulsatile
mass is discovered in a patient after prior OSR of an AAA,
the presence of an anastomotic pseudoaneurysm,68 iliac
artery aneurysm,69 or suprarenal aortic aneurysm70
should be considered. Abdominal or back pain after
EVAR should also prompt evaluation of potential aneurysm expansion or rupture.71-73
