type III endoleaks. Abdominal and pelvic CT imaging
should be performed every 5 years after OSR or EVAR.
We recommend baseline imaging in the ﬁrst month after EVAR
with contrast-enhanced CT and color duplex ultrasound
imaging. In the absence of an endoleak or sac enlargement,
imaging should be repeated in 12 months using contrastenhanced CT or color duplex ultrasound imaging.
Level of recommendation

1 (Strong)

Quality of evidence

B (Moderate)

If a type II endoleak is observed 1 month after EVAR, we
suggest postoperative surveillance with contrast-enhanced
CT and color duplex ultrasound imaging at 6 months.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

B (Moderate)

If neither endoleak nor AAA enlargement is observed 1 year
after EVAR, we suggest color duplex ultrasound when
feasible, or CT imaging if ultrasound is not possible, for
annual surveillance.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

If a type II endoleak is associated with an aneurysm sac that is
shrinking or stable in size, we suggest color duplex
ultrasound for continued surveillance at 6-month intervals
for 24 months and then annually thereafter.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

If a new endoleak is detected, we suggest evaluation for a type
I or type III endoleak.
Level of recommendation

Quality of evidence

We suggest noncontrast-enhanced CT imaging of the entire
aorta at 5-year intervals after open repair or EVAR.

COST AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS IN
ANEURYSM REPAIR
The complexity and intensity of aortic aneurysm treatment result in signiﬁcant costs and resource utilization.
These initial costs include imaging, preoperative risk
management, operating room, personnel, implants, and
recovery. Long-term follow-up and imaging have costs,
as does the treatment of any complications from the
initial procedure or failure of the graft itself. Besides these
provider costs, patients and their families also bear cost
from
