Description
Precision in the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis
We recommend use of precise anatomic terminology to characterize the most
proximal extent of venous thrombosis as involving the iliofemoral veins, with
or without extension into the inferior vena cava; the femoropopliteal veins; or
isolated to the calf veins in preference to simple characterization of a
thrombus as proximal or distal.
If iliofemoral venous thrombosis is suspected but not confirmed using standard
diagnostic modalities such as venous ultrasound imaging, we recommend the
use of adjunctive imaging modalities, such as computed tomography
venography or magnetic resonance venography to characterize the most
proximal thrombus extent.
Indications for early thrombus removal
We suggest a strategy of early thrombus removal in selected patients meeting the
following criteria (a) a first episode of acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis,
(b) symptoms ‚¨ç14 days in duration, (c) a low risk of bleeding, and (d)
ambulatory with good functional capacity and an acceptable life expectancy.
We recommend early thrombus removal strategies as the treatment of choice in
patients with limb-threatening venous ischemia due to iliofemoral deep
venous thrombosis with or without associated femoropopliteal venous
thrombosis (phlegmasia cerulea dolens).
We recommend that patients with isolated femoropopliteal deep venous
thrombosis be managed with conventional anticoagulation therapy because
there is currently insufficient evidence to support early thrombus removal
strategies in this patient population.
Techniques for early thrombus removal
We suggest percutaneous catheter-based techniques (pharmacologic or
pharmacomechanical) as first-line therapy for early throm
