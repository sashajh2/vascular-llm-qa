2 A more recent meta-analysis of 26
trials including more than 90,000 patients with coronary
artery or other atherosclerotic disease demonstrated a
greater than 15% decrease in the rate of stroke for every
10% reduction in serum LDL.83 The 2006 Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels trial
was the ﬁrst study to demonstrate the beneﬁts of statin
therapy in preventing recurrent stroke. Among 4731 patients who had experienced a stroke or TIA within 1 to
6 months of randomization to atorvastatin 80 mg/day or
placebo, there was a 33% decrease in the incidence of fatal
or nonfatal stroke and a 42% decrease in the overall incidence of cardiovascular events.84,85
In the Heart Protection Study, which included 20,536
patients, 3280 had a history of nondisabling ischemic
stroke or TIAs and were randomized to 40 mg of simvastatin or placebo. There was a 25% (95% CI, 15-34) proportional reduction in the ﬁrst event rate for stroke (4.4%
simvastatin vs 5.7% placebo) (P < .0001), indicating a
28% reduction in ischemic strokes (P < .0001).86 A
Cochrane review investigating the role of statins in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease included 18
randomized clinical trials of nearly 57,000 patients and
demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduction in incidence of
fatal and nonfatal strokes among patients randomized
to statin therapy.87
Although LDL levels are associated with stroke risk,
there is also some evidence that high levels of highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol may be protective,
but to a lesser degree.88 In 9247 patients with a mean
age of 61 who received treatment to reduce LDL and
raise HDL levels, an elevated total cholesterol/HDL ratio
was associated with a 22% increased risk of stroke
whereas an elevation in the HDL level was independently
associated with a 14% reduction in stroke
