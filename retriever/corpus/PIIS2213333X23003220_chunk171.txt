 intervention decreases the risk of thrombotic complications. Most reports describe open
surgical excision of saphenous aneurysms, with proximal and distal ligation or distal saphenous ablation.274,277,278,287-290 In two smaller series of mostly
small GSV aneurysms (<3 cm in size), located close to
the SFJ, endovenous ablation alone was used, without
proximal high ligation.158,276
, et al276 treated 11 limbs of 8 patients with
Pavlovic
RFA alone, without high ligation. All GSV aneurysms
were located near the SFJ, distal to the preterminal

valve. Median aneurysm diameter was 21 mm (interquartile range, 17.2-23.4 mm), all patients had incompetent GSV and CVD. The catheter tip was placed at
1 to 2 cm from the SFJ, within the aneurysmal
segment. Extra tumescent anesthetic and compression was used, and the ﬁrst segment was treated
with three cycles using RFA. Thromboprophylaxis
was given for 7 days. At a median follow-up of 8 years
median saphenous diameter was reduced to 5.8 mm,
the aneurysmal segment was either completely or
partly obliterated, and, if partly patent, always had
an antegrade ﬂow. One patient (9.1%) had EHIT III
despite thrombosis prophylaxis.
In a prospective study, Hamann et al158 treated 15
limbs of 13 patients with GSV aneurysm, located within
2 cm of the SFJ. Four aneurysms were surgically
excised, with proximal ligation, because they were
located near the SFJ and had a diameter >3 cm. The
other 11 were treated with endovenous ablation alone.
A generous amount of tumescent anesthesia was
used to diminish the aneurysm as much as possible.
Additional energy was applied in the aneurysmal
segment, either 100 Jou
