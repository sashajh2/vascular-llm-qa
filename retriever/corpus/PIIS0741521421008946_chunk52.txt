 at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE), demonstrated overall equivalence of
transfemoral CAS and CEA in management of carotid
stenosis, although the number of symptomatic patients
was too small for subgroup analysis.201 Two large randomized European trials, Endarterectomy vs Angioplasty
in Patients with Symptomatic Severe Carotid Stenosis
(EVA-3S)7 and Stent Protected Angioplasty vs CEA
(SPACE1),8 examined CAS vs CEA in neurologically
symptomatic patients. EVA-3S showed a statistically
inferior 30-day outcome for transfemoral CAS compared
with CEA (stroke death, 9.5% vs 3.8%) in these patients.
However, this study was criticized because of the relatively low level of operator experience (minimum of 12
transfemoral CAS cases or 35 supra-aortic trunk cases, of
which 5 had to be transfemoral CAS procedures)
required in the CAS arm. The Stent-Supported Percutaneous Angioplasty of the Carotid Artery vs Endarterectomy (SPACE) trial was designed to test “equivalence”
between CEA and CAS in patients with neurologic
symptoms but the trial was stopped after recruitment of
1200 patients owing to the futility of proving equivalence
between the two treatments. The 30-day risk of death or
ipsilateral stroke was 6.84% for CAS and 6.34% for CEA in
1183 randomized patients. However, the study was not
powered appropriately and failed to show noninferiority
of transfemoral CAS compared with CEA (P < .09).
More recently, two large, randomized trials have been
completed. The International Carotid Stenting Study
Trial (ICST)6 enrolled 1713 patients and demonstrated
signiﬁcantly increased periprocedural stroke risk for
transfemoral CAS (7.7%) compared with CEA (4.1%) in
neurologically symptomatic patients (P < .002). The risk
of any stroke or death less than 30 days after treatment
in the stenting group was more than twice that in the
endarterectomy group (
