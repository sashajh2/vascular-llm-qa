of intervention. The second question appraised and
compared the efﬁcacy of OPAR and EPAR. The Mayo
Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center conducted the
reviews. The search strategy identiﬁed 2191 references, of
which 33 original studies and 4 systematic reviews were
included. One systematic review of 13 studies and two
additional original studies (836 PAAs) had evaluated the
natural history question, and 3 meta-analyses and 31
studies (5381 patients and >5000 PAAs) had evaluated
the comparative question. The methodology group performing the systematic review independently selected
and appraised the studies and subsequently collaborated with the expert panel to integrate evidence into
recommendations.33
Guidelines. Recommendation 1:We recommend that
patients who present with a PAA are screened for
both a contralateral PAA and an AAA (grade 1B)
The incidence of PAAs in the general population is relatively low, ranging from 0.1% to 2.8%.10,53 Given their rarity, screening unselected patients or patients undergoing
AAA screening has not been found to be cost-effective.54
Patients with a known PAA, however, have a greater risk
of having a contralateral PAA or an AAA. Two separate reviews of the reported data, spanning two separate eras,
both identiﬁed similar rates of contralateral PAAs (48%
and 50%) and associated AAAs (36% and 38%).1,2 Given
these associations, we recommend that patients who
present with a PAA undergo screening of their contralateral leg and abdomen for both PAAs and AAAs, if not
already known, preferably using DUS. Such screening
should be repeated every 5 years.
The incidence of a PAA in patients with an AAA has been
reported to range from 3% to 11%.24,54-56 This incidence appears to be greater in men with an AAA and in patients with
larger AAAs. Routine screening of all patients with small
AAAs for a PAA is controversial and may not be cost-effective.54,57 Men with larger AAAs may beneﬁt from DUS
