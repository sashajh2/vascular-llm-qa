 of intermediate
RAAs >2 cm with surveillance, the natural history of
these aneurysms appears more benign than historic
rates have suggested, with lower associated risks of
rupture, slow to null rates of growth, and improved survival after rupture apparent from more contemporary
series.
The natural history of RAAs appears to be that of slow or
no growth.27 Contemporary reports do not support historic series that described rupture rates as high as 14%
to 30% with associated mortality of 80%.9,28,29 Modernday rupture rates are estimated at 3% to 5%, with nongestational mortality improved to <10%.9,30-34 Most ruptures are diagnosed at the time of presentation, and

Ruptured RAAs are associated with a mortality of
approximately 10% in the general population and
maternal and fetal death in 55% and 85%, respectively.37,41 Emergent surgery is required to prevent exsanguination; aortic control may be necessary. In many
cases, renal artery reconstruction and renal salvage may
not be feasible, and thus nephrectomy should be
considered.
Pregnancy has been associated with increased risk and
rates of rupture, presumptively secondary to hemodynamic changes and increased vascular volume and
ﬂow during pregnancy, abdominal pressure changes
secondary to mass effect from the gravid uterus, and hormonal changes that may disrupt the vessel wall.27,41-43
Pregnancy-associated rupture appears to complicate
the third trimester in most cases, with postpartum
rupture infrequently referenced in case reports only.44,45

Whereas no large-scale studies detail the true incidence
of gestational renal aneurysm rupture, in a series of
180,000 pregnancies brought to term, no ruptures were
identiﬁed.46 Despite this, small aneurysm size (ie, 1 cm)
at rupture and high historic rates of maternal and fetal
mortality that approximate 56% to 92% and 82% to
100%, respectively, support the more aggressive treatment of RAAs in women of childbearing
