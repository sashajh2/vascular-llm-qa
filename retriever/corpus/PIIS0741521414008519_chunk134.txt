In patients with C3 and C4 disease of primary valvular
reﬂux or C1-C4 disease related to DVT, we recommend
regular ambulation or equivalent exercise, leg elevation
when in bed or recumbent, good skin care to maintain
skin moisture and to prevent drying and cracking, and footwear that is well ﬁtted. Leg elevation is effective in patients
with C4 disease by increasing microcirculatory ﬂow.542
Although employing only a surrogate measure, a prospective study of exercise in 20 patients showed similar results in C5 patients, with an improvement in calf muscle
pump function.543 A structured review also suggested a
positive effect of exercise (ambulation) on calf muscle
pump function, although not directly assessed for VLU
occurrence.443 An RCT of structured exercise with 31 patients with C3 or higher clinical class venous disease
showed improved calf muscle pump function compared
with no speciﬁc exercise.492 It is not uncommon for patients to have both venous reﬂux and diabetes, and standard guidelines in foot care for diabetics have been
produced.544
Evidence for all these measures in preventing VLU is
weak. In consideration of shoe types, one study suggested
that high heels may decrease hydrostatic pressure at the ankles.545 A separate study using air plethysmography showed
that high heels were associated with decreased ejection
fraction and increased residual volume fraction.546 However, speciﬁc footwear and risk of VLU has not been tested,
but caution should be exercised in those with C3 or higher
clinical class venous disease. One study also suggested that
correction of pedal podalic angle with special insoles may
increase the calf muscle pump function.547
No data exist for educational interventions in those
with CVI to prevent VLU. However, the cost of and risk
to patients and family education are likely to be reasonable,
with little potential for harm. Knowledge of family history
of maternal venous reﬂux is important as a progn
