flow obstruction, and should rarely be considered as an isolated procedure. A decrease in compartmental
pressures will accompany successful relief of outflow obstruction53 and usually obviates the need for fasciotomy.
We suggest that fasciotomy only be considered if compartment pressures in the thigh or calf remain elevated (⬎30
mm Hg) despite efforts to restore iliofemoral venous outflow using the procedures outlined above (Grade 2C).
Fasciotomy in the setting of thrombolytic therapy and
anticoagulation may be associated with significant blood
loss.
2.3. We recommend that patients with isolated
femoropopliteal deep venous thrombosis be managed
with conventional anticoagulation therapy because
there is currently insufficient evidence to support early
thrombus removal strategies in this patient population
(Grade 1C). The role of early thrombus removal in the
treatment of femoropopliteal DVT remains poorly defined.
Consensus-based documents have suggested that the
threshold for thrombus removal strategies in acute femoropopliteal DVT should be higher than for iliofemoral
DVT.27 Compared with iliofemoral DVT, femoropopliteal
DVT is associated with less deranged hemodynamics, a
lower risk of the postthrombotic syndrome,8 and a lower
risk of recurrent VTE.6 Harvesting of the femoral vein as a
conduit for arterial reconstruction has been shown to be
tolerated with few symptoms. Among 81 limbs in which
the femoropopliteal vein was harvested, mild edema was
reported in 31%, with no skin changes or ulceration.65 Late
follow-up (70.1 ⫾ 5.6 months) of 28 such limbs showed
advanced chronic venous disease (CEAP C3 to C6) in only
14.8%.66 Although such limbs may show plethysmographic
evidence of venous outflow obstruction,66 this is usually

well compensated due to axial transformation of the profunda femoris vein through remnants of the axial limb
vein.67
Multicenter registries have further suggested a less
favorable outcome for
