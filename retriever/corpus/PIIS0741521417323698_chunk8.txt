 ST-segment or non-STsegment elevation myocardial infarction (MI), unstable
angina, or stable angina with left main coronary artery
or three-vessel disease.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

B (Moderate)

We suggest coronary revascularization before aneurysm
repair in patients with stable angina and two-vessel disease that includes the proximal left descending artery
and either ischemia on noninvasive stress testing or
reduced left ventricular function (ejection fraction
< 50%).
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

B (Moderate)

In patients who may need aneurysm repair in the subsequent 12 months and in whom percutaneous coronary
intervention is indicated, we suggest a strategy of balloon
angioplasty or bare-metal stent placement, followed by 4
to 6 weeks of dual antiplatelet therapy.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

B (Moderate)

We suggest deferring elective aneurysm repair for 30
days after bare-metal stent placement or coronary artery
bypass surgery if clinical circumstances permit. As an
alternative, EVAR may be performed with uninterrupted
continuation of dual antiplatelet therapy.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

B (Moderate)

We suggest deferring open aneurysm repair for at least
6 months after drug-eluting coronary stent placement or,
alternatively, performing EVAR with continuation of dual
antiplatelet therapy.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

B (Moderate)

In patients with a drug-eluting coronary stent requiring
open aneurysm repair, we recommend discontinuation
of P2Y12 platelet receptor inhibitor therapy 10 days

preoperatively with continuation of aspirin. The P2Y12 inhibitor should be restarted as soon as possible after surgery. The relative risks and beneﬁts of perioperative
bleeding and stent thrombosis should be discussed with
the patient.

We recommend preoperative hydration in nondialysisdependent patients with renal insufﬁciency before aneurysm repair.
