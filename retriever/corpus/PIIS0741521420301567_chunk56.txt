0% of cases.133,134 Of patients with a CAA, 18% to
20% will have an aortic aneurysm, and 18% to 38%
will have an additional visceral artery aneurysm.135 Peripheral artery aneurysms are seen in 18% to 67% of
patients.117

sac thrombosis may not protect the aneurysm sac from
pressure transmitted through thrombus, and eventual
sac growth or rupture may still occur.109,110 Reports of
reperfusion and even rupture after “successful” embolization of visceral aneurysms support the notion that a
thrombosed aneurysm may not represent the deﬁnitive
treatment in all cases.111,112 Regular follow-up with duplex

evidence

5.1

In patients in whom a CAA is being observed with a nonoperative or noninterventional
approach, we suggest annual surveillance with CTA scans to assess for growth in size.

B (Moderate)

5.2.

After endovascular intervention for CAAs, we suggest periodic surveillance with
appropriate imaging studies to assess for the possibility of endoleak or other
continued aneurysm perfusion that could lead to a continued risk of aneurysm
growth or rupture.

2 (Weak)

B (Moderate)

In a reported series of 18 CAAs in which nonoperative
management was performed in 8 asymptomatic patients, only one subsequent rupture was noted to
occur.117 The other observed CAAs had no evidence of
enlargement or rupture during a mean 91-month
follow-up period.117 Because rupture of CAAs has been
reported to occur at diameters <20 mm, close radiologic
follow-up of those selected for observation with yearly CT
scans is appropriate.
Continued surveillance, even after secondary technical
success, is imperative as the natural history of visceral artery aneurysms after endovascular treatment remains
unclear. This is especially true of saccular aneurysms
