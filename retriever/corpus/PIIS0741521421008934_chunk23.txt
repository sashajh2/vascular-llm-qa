 for clinical trials. Nolan et al40
reviewed data from the Vascular Study Group of New England and showed a higher rate of stroke and death for
symptomatic patients treated with CAS compared with
those treated with CEA (5.1% with CAS vs 1.6% with
CEA; P ¼ .001). Similarly, Hicks et al41 studied almost
52,000 carotid procedures in the VQI and found that
for symptomatic high-risk patients (determined using
Medicare criteria), the risk of stroke and death after
CEA was 2.3% compared with 3.6% after CAS (P < .001).
The difference in the stroke rate was twofold greater for
CAS in both the general population and the
propensity-matched patient cohorts (HR, 2.23; 95% CI,
1.58-3.15; P < .001).41 The lower stroke and death rates
observed in registries includes only in-hospital events
and, as such, could be lower than those observed in clinical trials that use 30-day event rates and mandatory
postprocedure
evaluations

Timing of CEA. Increasing evidence has shown that
CEA provides maximum beneﬁt if performed
in <14 days for patients presenting with TIA or amaurosis
fugax.17 Natural history studies reported that the incidence of recurrent symptoms after the index TIA ranges
from 5% to 8% at 48 hours, 4% to 17% at 72 hours, 8% to
22% at 7 days, and 11% to 25% at 14 days.17
Transcarotid artery revascularization
Early data suggested that TCAR might have a role in the
treatment of patients with symptomatic carotid occlusive disease. Studies have shown that TCAR results in a
similar rate of infarcts using diffusion-weighted imaging
(DWI) on postprocedure magnetic resonance imaging
compared with CEA and that TF-CAS is associated with
a two-to threefold greater rate of DWI.42 Up to 50% of
the inf
