or local anesthesia. Whereas a number of retrospective
studies suggest that the type of anesthetic inﬂuences
operative time, length of hospital stay, and risk of
morbidity, a mortality beneﬁt has yet to be identiﬁed.
In a retrospective analysis of nearly 4000 patients in the
EUROSTAR registry, local anesthesia was associated
with shorter operative times, reduced ICU admission,
shorter hospital stay, and fewer systemic complications.560 There was a modest advantage of epidural anesthesia compared with general anesthesia. A recent
review of the American College of Surgeons NSQIP database demonstrated that general anesthesia was associated with longer hospital stay and increased
pulmonary morbidity compared with local or regional
anesthesia.561 A meta-analysis of 13,459 patients undergoing EVAR revealed that patients undergoing local anesthesia were older and had more severe cardiac and
pulmonary disease but experienced shorter operative
times and hospital stays and suffered fewer complications.562 A limitation of this review was the inability to account for aneurysm anatomy and morphologic
complexity, which may have inﬂuenced the selection of
general anesthesia for repair.
We recommend general endotracheal anesthesia for patients
undergoing open aneurysm repair.

Anesthetic considerations in the patient with a
ruptured aneurysm. Regardless of the choice of EVAR or
OSR, there is evidence to support the implementation of
a standardized protocol for the efﬁcient evaluation and
treatment of ruptured aneurysm, including anesthetic
management.451,469 Notably, the surgical ﬁeld should
be initially draped and a transfemoral aortic balloon
placed, especially if general anesthesia is required,
because of the likelihood of vasodilation, hypotension,
and cardiovascular collapse. Permissive hypotension to
maintain a systolic blood pressure of 80 mm Hg limits
volume overload and appears sufﬁcient to maintain
critical end-organ perfusion.563 The use of local anesthesia for EVAR, most often, does not provide sufﬁcient
pain control for the patient experiencing signiﬁcant
