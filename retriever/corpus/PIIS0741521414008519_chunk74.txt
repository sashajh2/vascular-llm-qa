Guideline 4.5 Hydrosurgical Débridement
We suggest hydrosurgical débridement as an alternative to standard surgical débridement of venous leg
ulcers. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 4.6: Ultrasonic Débridement
We suggest against ultrasonic débridement over
surgical débridement in the treatment of venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 4.7: Enzymatic Débridement
We suggest enzymatic débridement of venous leg
ulcers when no clinician trained in surgical débridement is available to débride the wound. [GRADE - 2;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C] We do not suggest enzymatic débridement over surgical débridement.

Guideline 4.8: Biologic Débridement
We suggest that larval therapy for venous leg ulcers
can be used as an alternative to surgical débridement.
[GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
No method of débridement has been proved to be superior to surgical methods. However, in some cases, patients may not have ready access to a clinician trained to
perform surgical débridement, or this method may be
less desirable because of comorbid patient conditions or
pain considerations. Hydrosurgical débridement was
found in some studies to shorten the procedural time of
débridement but may be associated with signiﬁcant additional cost.229,230 Hydrosurgical débridement also requires a trained clinician and may be associated with
signiﬁcant periprocedural pain. No measurable beneﬁt of
the use of ultrasound methods to débride wounds has
been reliably demonstrated. Enzymatic débridement,
which does not require a trained clinician for application,
has been found in several studies to remove nonviable tissue from VLU wound beds, but there is no evidence that
this method provides a beneﬁt over surgical débridement.231-233 In clinical trials, larval therapy
