 lower stroke incidence compared with
the medical therapy arm. However, the effect of CEA was
not as great (0.7% vs 1.3% annually; P < .0001) for those
receiving lipid-lowering therapy compared with 1.8% vs
3.3% annually (P < .0001) for those not receiving lipidlowering therapy.23
More recently, Howard et al26 conducted a prospective
population-based cohort study (Oxford vascular study)
and systematic review and meta-analysis to analyze the
correlation between ipsilateral stroke and the degree of
asymptomatic carotid stenosis in patients treated with
contemporary best medical therapy. They enrolled 2354
consecutive patients (2178 patients with carotid imaging
studies), including 207 with 50% to 99% asymptomatic
carotid stenosis. The ipsilateral stroke rate at 5 years for
the patients with 70% to 99% carotid stenosis was

14.6% (6 of 53) compared with 0% for the 154 patients
with 50% to <70% stenosis (P < .0001). For patients
with 80% to 99% carotid stenosis, the ipsilateral stroke
rate was signiﬁcantly greater than that for those with
50% to <80% stenosis: 5 of 34 (18.3%) vs 1 of 173 (1%;
P < .0001). In their systematic review of 56 reports and
13,717 patients, 23 studies provided data on ipsilateral
stroke and the degree of asymptomatic carotid stenosis
in 8419 patients. Ipsilateral stroke was also linearly associated with the degree of ipsilateral carotid stenosis (P <
.0001). Patients with 70% to 99% carotid stenosis (386
of 3778 patients) had a greater risk of ipsilateral stroke
than those with 50% to <70% stenosis (18
