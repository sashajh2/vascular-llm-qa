 stroke risk. In general, the rates of stroke,
myocardial infarction (MI), and death have been used
when comparing CAS against CEA. In most clinical trials
comparing CAS with CEA, stroke, MI, and death have
been given equal weight in determining a composite
endpoint to test overall efﬁcacy. Data from the CREST (carotid revascularization endarterectomy vs stenting trial),9
however, indicated that stroke has a more signiﬁcant effect
on patients’ quality of life at 1 year than does nonfatal MI.
Because the primary goal of intervention for carotid stenosis is stroke prevention, in developing the recommendations, the committee placed more emphasis on the
prevention of stroke and procedurally related death than
on the occurrence of periprocedural MI. This could have
resulted in committee recommendations that differed
from the reported results from some trials in which these
three endpoints were given equal weight in the analysis.
The threat of stroke in symptomatic patients with <50%
stenosis has generally been considered to be small and
typically will not warrant intervention. The ECST (European Carotid Surgery Trial) and NASCET (North American
Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) demonstrated that CEA was unable to reduce the subsequent
neurologic event rates in patients with symptoms of cerebral ischemia and bifurcation stenosis of <50% diameter
reduction and was actually associated with increased
morbidity compared with medical management.33-35
NASCET and ECST both demonstrated the beneﬁt of
CEA compared with maximal medical treatment for
neurologically symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis with a reduced diameter of >50%.6,33-35 NASCET
demonstrated a relative risk (RR) reduction of 65% and
an absolute risk reduction in stroke of 17% at 2 years
(26% in the medical arm vs 9% in the surgical arm) for
patients with >70% carotid stenosis. ECST demonstrated
a similar reduction in stroke risk after 3 years. The medical arm had a 26.5% stroke risk compared with 14.9% in
the surgical group, an absolute risk reduction of 1
