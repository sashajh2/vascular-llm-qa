 vertebrobasilar insufﬁciency. Left
arm ischemia symptoms may range from none to a
frankly threatened limb. Special consideration should
be given to LSA revascularization and left arm perfusion
for patients at risk of coronary ischemia due to a prior
left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior
descending artery coronary bypass graft as well as for
those with existing arteriovenous ﬁstulas in the left arm.
Although ﬂow reversal in the vertebral artery is common
after LSA coverage, most patients are asymptomatic
from this hemodynamic perturbation. However, some
may suffer from subclavian steal syndrome and symptomatic vertebrobasilar insufﬁciency manifested as syncope, diplopia, or vertigo. In one series, upper extremity
ischemia occurred 12% to 20% of the time after LSA

coverage, although <40% of patients with symptoms of
arm ischemia underwent delayed LSA revascularization.140,141 Because presentation of ischemic symptoms
of the arm is often delayed, with time to presentation
ranging from 2 days to 26 months, revascularization can
typically be addressed on a less urgent basis.
Additional considerations. The Knowledge and
Encounter Research Unit performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis relating to the effect of
LSA coverage on the morbidity and mortality of patients
undergoing TEVAR.142 This analysis found that coverage
of the LSA without revascularization compared with
coverage with revascularization was associated with
trends toward increased risk of spinal cord ischemia (OR,
2.69; 95% CI, 0.75-9.68), anterior circulation stroke (OR,
2.58; 95% CI, 0.82-8.09), arm ischemia (OR, 47.7; 95% CI,
9.9-229.3), and vertebrobasilar ischemia (OR, 10.8; 95% CI,
3.17-36.7). More data have been published since 2009,
such as a large single-center series in which the combined stroke, paraplegia, and
