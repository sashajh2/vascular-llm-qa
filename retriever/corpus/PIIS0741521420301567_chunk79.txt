1.1

In patients who are thought to have GDAA and PDAA, we recommend CTA as the
diagnostic tool of choice.

1.2

In patients in whom celiac stenosis is suspected, we suggest further workup with
duplex ultrasound to elucidate whether the stenosis is hemodynamically signiﬁcant.

1.3

In patients with high radiation exposure risks or renal insufﬁciency, we suggest noncontrast-enhanced MRA for diagnosis.

C (Low)

Technical remark: Non-contrast-enhanced MRA is best suited to children and women
of childbearing potential or those who have contraindications to CTA or MRA contrast
materials (ie, pregnancy, renal insufﬁciency, or gadolinium contrast material allergy).

tool of choice because it can provide arterial-phase,
venous-phase, and non-contrast-enhanced images in a
rapid manner.137 Furthermore, ﬁndings of diaphragmatic
crura hypertrophy, a focal narrowing of the proximal celiac axis with a hooked appearance, and retrograde ﬁlling
of the dorsal pancreatic and pancreaticoduodenal arteries on three-dimensional CTA are suggestive of median arcuate ligament syndrome and may direct the
surgeon to consider a median arcuate ligament release
in addition to treatment of the GDAA or PDAA.196

Although non-contrast-enhanced MRA sequences can
be more time-consuming than contrast-enhanced
MRA, non-contrast-enhanced MRA has almost the
same sensitivity for detecting vascular abnormalities
and a high negative predictive value. Non-contrastenhanced MRA (like contrast-enhanced MRA) can be superior and complementary to ultrasound in evaluating
most parts of the body because it is not limited by acoustic windows, particularly in the thoracoabdominal vasculature.202-204
