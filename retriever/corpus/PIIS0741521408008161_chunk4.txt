 by the corresponding evidence: values and preferences, which are factors other than
evidence that the committee considered when issuing recommendations; and if needed, technical remarks, describing the committee’s consensus regarding best practices in
medical management, carotid endarterectomy, and carotids stenting.
RECOMMENDATION
In symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with low
grade carotid stenosis (stenosis ⬍50% in symptomatic patients and ⬍60% in asymptomatic patients); we recommend
optimal medical therapy rather than revascularization
(GRADE 1 recommendation, high quality evidence).
Evidence
A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized
trials that compared carotid endarterectomy with medical
management in patients with ipsilateral symptomatic carotid stenosis3 pooled results from two large multicenter
RCTs that included a total of 5950 patients, the North
American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial
(NASCET),10,11 and the European Carotid Surgery Trial
(ECST).12 Patients with low grade stenosis (NASCET

⬍50%, ECST ⬍70%) were in fact, harmed by surgery to the
extent that endarterectomy increased the risk of disabling
stroke or death by 20% (95% confidence interval [CI]
0%-44%) and the number of patients needed to be operated
on to cause one disabling stroke or death was 45 (95% CI
22 - infinity). Despite the inadequate blinding of outcome
assessors in NASCET and ECST (unblinded assessors presented data to a blinded outcome review board); both trials
were well executed, used the intention-to-treat analysis,
and had adequate allocation concealment.
Values statement
In formulating this recommendation, the committee
placed a relatively higher value on preventing harms associated with carotid endarterectomy, particularly stroke,
death and myocardial infarction, and a relatively lower
value on the cost and side effects of medical management
(eg, gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin, myopathy with
statins, and so on).
Medical therapy
The best medical management for stroke prevention
was highlighted in clinical practice guidelines issued jointly
in 2006 by the American
