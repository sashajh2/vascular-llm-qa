 the standard. However, this
target level was recently lowered to 130/80 in the 2017
guidelines released by the AHA and the American College of Cardiology.63
In addition to its clinical beneﬁt, reduction of elevated
blood pressure also has been demonstrated to have beneﬁts pathologically. Several trials showed that elevated
blood pressure is associated with development of carotid
atherosclerosis,64-66 and other research indicated that
reduction in carotid pulse pressure was associated with
a parallel reduction in intima-media thickness.67 Further,
there is evidence that antihypertensive therapy may slow
progression of carotid atherosclerosis and possibly promote plaque regression.68 However, a more recent
meta-analysis demonstrated that calcium channel
blockers reduce intima-medial thickness to a greater degree than diuretics, beta blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, suggesting that the origin of
this beneﬁcial effect may be more complex than simple
lowering of blood pressure.69
Treatment of diabetes mellitus
The relationship between blood glucose levels and cerebrovascular disease is complex. The Insulin Resistance
Atherosclerosis Study and the Atherosclerosis Risk in the
Community Study demonstrated associations between
diabetes and carotid artery intima-media thickness as
well as progression in intima-media thickness.70,71 More
recent work indicates that plaque burden and plaque
instability are inﬂuenced by diabetes status.72
Among patients with documented carotid artery disease in the Cardiovascular Health Study, elevated fasting
blood glucose level was associated with increased stroke
risk,73 and in the Northern Manhattan Study, diabetes
was associated with a doubling of the stroke risk.74 However, a recent meta-analysis of nine randomized clinical
trials and nearly 60,000 patients did not conﬁrm that
tight control of glucose levels decreased stroke risk.75
Further, no reduction in stroke risk was identiﬁed despite
achieving a hemoglobin A1c level of less than 6.5% in
either the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study,
the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes
study, or the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease:
Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation
