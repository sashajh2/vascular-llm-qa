Factors affecting mortality of OSR include the surgeon
and hospital volume, urgency of the procedure, age of
the patient, presence and severity of comorbidities, and
proximal aneurysm extension. Symptomatic coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, severe chronic pulmonary disease, and advanced chronic kidney disease
remain the most important predictors of mortality.364
There has been considerable variation in 30-day mortality rates in the literature, depending on the type of study
reported and its design.429 Elective 30-day mortality for
infrarenal AAA OSR in most contemporary large singlecenter institutional reports has ranged from 1% to
4%.109,430,431 Population-based studies, derived from state
and national databases, indicate higher mortality rates of
4% to 8% across the entire spectrum of hospitals and
health care organizations.34,109,145,419,432-437 Recent multicenter, prospective, randomized trials have demonstrated 30-day mortality of 3% to 4.7%.368,438,439
Analyses of outcomes in Medicare beneﬁciaries indicate
that OSR mortality, although improved in the last
decade, remains higher than that associated with EVAR
for every age category.364 Similarly, the morbidity of
