An analysis of national trends in the United States
conﬁrms that EVAR is being used with increasing frequency for the treatment of ruptured AAA, with a
decrease in associated mortality.474,475 Outcomes are superior when EVAR for a ruptured aneurysm is performed
in teaching hospitals and high-volume centers.474

If it is anatomically feasible, we recommend EVAR over open
repair for treatment of a ruptured AAA.

Management of postoperative complications.
Abdominal compartment syndrome. Abdominal
compartment syndrome is a well-recognized complication after both OSR and EVAR for ruptured aneurysm
and may occur in approximately 7% of patients.476 Use
of an aortic occlusion balloon, coagulopathy, massive
transfusion, and conversion to an aortouni-iliac device
are all predictors of abdominal compartment syndrome. 477 Abdominal compartment syndrome typically occurs in the hemodynamically unstable patient
with a large retroperitoneal hematoma. Diffuse visceral
edema results in intra-abdominal hypertension and
multiple system organ dysfunction, including oliguria,
increased peak airway pressures, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, hypotension, and decreased cardiac output.
Early recognition and surgical decompression are
necessary to improve survival.478
Ischemic colitis. Colonic ischemia after repair of a
ruptured AAA may occur in as many as one in ﬁve to
one in three patients.479 Ischemic colitis after vascular
surgery has been associated with mortality rates of 45%
to 67%, with recent reports demonstrating only modest
improvement in outcomes.480 Delayed diagnosis, with
advanced ischemic colitis leading to perforation, is
associated with a mortality rate in excess of 90%,481 and a
retrospective review of 222 patients revealed that
ischemic colitis is the most common cause of death after
open repair of a ruptured aneurysm.482 Colonic ischemia
is much less frequent after EVAR than after OSR for
ruptured aneurysm (23% vs
