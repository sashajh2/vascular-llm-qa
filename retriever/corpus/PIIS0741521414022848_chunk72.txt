 FPOD, with
a higher proportion of acute limb ischemia events
compared with BMS, particularly when distal collateral vessels are covered.214 Covered stents may have a role in the
treatment of diffuse in-stent restenosis in the SFA.215 At
the present time, given the increased cost and lack of clinical superiority over BMSs, a primary role for covered stents
in the treatment of IC due to FPOD remains unclear.
Balloon-expandable or self-expanding covered stents may
have a role in the treatment of highly calciﬁed focal SFA
lesions, but this has not been prospectively evaluated.
Plaque excision by mechanical atherectomy using cutting blades, laser ablation, or “sanding” with a diamondencrusted burr has been proposed as an alternative to
angioplasty and stenting for symptomatic PAD. In a recent
meta-analysis of four randomized studies including only
220 patients comparing atherectomy with other established
treatments, including angioplasty, stenting, lower extremity bypass, and exercise therapy, the authors concluded
there was no evidence to support the superiority of atherectomy over angioplasty for any outcome. They also observed
that the quality of existing evidence is poor and recommended further study with properly powered trials.199
Antimyoproliferative drug-coated balloons have been
evaluated for the treatment of SFA disease in patients with
claudication. The Taxan with Short Exposure for Reduction
of Restenosis in Distal Arteries (THUNDER),202 Femoral
Paclitaxel (FemPac),203 and Moxy Drug Coated Balloon
vs Standard Balloon Angioplasty for the Treatment of Femoropopliteal Arteries (LEVANT 1)201 studies demonstrated
improved patency relative to PTA without drug coating but
were limited by small sample sizes, heterogeneous patient
populations, and incomplete follow-up. Two larger regulatory trials (LEVANT 2, IN.PACT SFA216) have recently reported improved patency for drug-coated versus uncoated
balloon angioplasty in femoropopliteal disease. As a result,
the FDA has recently approved two drug-coated balloon devices for the
