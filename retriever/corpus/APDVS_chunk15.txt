ema is called “pitting” when the indentation persists after applying pressure to a
small area. Pitting edema is associated with systemic diseases like heart failure, chronic
kidney disease, hypoproteinemia, or local disease of the veins or lymphatic. Non-pitting
edema is observed when the indentation does not persist. It is associated with myxedema,
lipedema, and advanced lymphedema.
 Claudication: Patients with claudication may have no significant finding on inspection
apart from muscle atrophy or hair loss.
Auscultation
 Auscultate the femoral region for the presence of any bruits. Auscultation may also find
continuous bruits which are likely due to an arterio-venous fistula.
Palpation
 Femoral pulse: palpated under the inguinal ligament, two-finger breaths from the pubic
tubercle.

 Popliteal pulse: with the patient’s knee fexed, both hands are wrapped around the knee,
and the tips of the fingertips are pressed into the popliteal space (posteriorly). The pulse
is located slightly lateral to midline. A normal popliteal artery may not be palpable.
 Dorsalis Pedis: palpated in the dorsum of the foot between the first and second extensor
tendons. Located just lateral to the tendon of extensor hallucis longus. You can ask the
patient to extend their great toe to identify the tendon.Postier tibial: palpated b posterior
to the medial malleolus. It is easier to palpate with the foot passively dorsifexed.
 Peroneal artery: not palpable. However, it can be found with a doppler on the lateral
aspect of the ankle
 When a pulse is not palpated, a doppler is used to assess the blood fow. The doppler
signal can be triphasic, biphasic, or monophasic.
 Triphasic and biphasic doppler signals indicate good blood fow.
 Monophasic signals correlate with a moderate to severe decrease in arterial blood fow.
 In severe ischemia, a soft continuous venous signal may be all that is heard.
 Temperature changes may help demarcate the level of disease.
 Sensory loss may be present in acute ischemia and chronic neuropathy.
