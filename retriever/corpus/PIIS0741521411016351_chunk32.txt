 Atherosclerosis Progression122
study all showed increased regression of the carotid artery
intima-media thickness compared with controls.
Although LDL is the primary determinant of cardiovascular and stroke risk, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol also influence stroke risk, and elevation of HDL has been shown to reduce the risk of
stroke.123 In an analysis of a large (â¬Ž9200) series of patients, treated by dual therapy aimed at decreasing LDL and
raising HDL, elevation of HDL level was independently
associated with a reduction of stroke risk by a factor of 0.86.
Conversely, an elevated total cholesterol/HDL ratio increased stroke risk by a factor of 1.22. Reducing cholesterol
absorption has also been shown to reduce stroke risk in
patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.124 Overall,
however, the HDL level had much less effect on stroke risk
than did the level of LDL.
Elevated cholesterol, comorbid CAD, or evidence of
an atherosclerotic etiology of carotid stenosis should be
managed according to National Cholesterol Education
Program-Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines,125 which
include lifestyle modification or medications, or both. Statin agents are recommended targeting LDL of 100 mg/
dL, for those with coronary heart disease or symptomatic
atherosclerotic disease, and LDL of 70 mg/dL for very
high-risk persons with multiple risk factors.
D. Smoking cessation
Smoking nearly doubles the risk of stroke.126,127
Smoking also acts synergistically on other risk factors that
are known to increase the risk of stroke, such as CAD and
PAD. Conversely, smoking cessation results in a reduction
in risk for CAD and for coronary mortality.128 Cessation
also reduces the risk of stroke in men and women.128-130
Counseling and smoking cessation medications are effective in helping smokers to quit. Physician counseling is an
important and effective intervention that reduces smoking
in patients by 10% to 20%131 but continues to be underused.132 Nicotine replacement therapy, in the form of
patches and gums, is effective in reducing smoking.133
