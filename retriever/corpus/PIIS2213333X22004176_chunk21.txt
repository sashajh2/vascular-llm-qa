HD
ultrasound sensitivity at the SFJ (95%) but concluded that
HHD ultrasound was not satisfactory for the evaluation of
reﬂux at the SPJ. Another study by Wills et al47 found HHD
ultrasound sensitivity of 71% at the SFJ and concluded
that 29% of the limbs would have had sites of reﬂux left
untreated without a DU evaluation. Dhillon et al46 recently
compared HHD ultrasound with point-of-care portable
color Doppler ultrasound in assessing venous reﬂux.
Although portable color Doppler ultrasound had had
marginally greater sensitivity than HHD ultrasound and a
better negative predictive value above the knee, both
tests had had an w30% negative predictive value, which is
inadequate for the exclusion of signiﬁcant reﬂux. Similar
to several other studies and reviews,48,49 we recommend
routine DU scanning for deﬁnitive evaluation of patients
for venous reﬂux. The relevant PICO (patients, intervention,
comparator, outcome) data of ﬁve studies are summarized in Table I.42-46
Of the other imaging modalities, descending contrast
venography will be useful for some patients to diagnose
reﬂux in the superﬁcial veins.50 Ascending venography
can provide additional information on the anatomy of
the superﬁcial system. Also, in some cases, it could help
intraoperatively to allow for complete ablation of the superﬁcial veins.51 However, in the era of high-resolution DU
imaging and other less invasive diagnostic imaging
studies, contrast venography is rarely used today for the
preoperative evaluation of patients with varicose veins.
Contrast venography, intravascular ultrasound, computed
tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic
resonance venography have been reserved for the investigation of the anatomy and function of the deep venous
system.52-54 Based on evidence of the systematic review
and additional data from the literature, including the recommendations of the 2020 appropriate use criteria of
multiple vascular societies,16 the panel strongly supports
DU scanning as the current reference standard for the
evaluation of reﬂux in patients with CVD.
