 care in current domestic practice, compared with a length of stay of
1.6 days for CAS. When data were adjusted for length of
stay, CEA was less costly than CAS.659 In another early institutional series of 46 patients undergoing CAS and 48 patients undergoing CEA, CAS was associated with higher
total procedural costs ($17,402 vs $12,112; P ¼ .029) and
direct costs ($10,522 vs $7227; P ¼ .017). Of note, the hospital length of stay was 1.2 days for CAS and 2.1 days for CEA.
The major driver of the difference was supply costs for CAS
and CEA ($15,407 vs $1953; P ¼ .001), respectively.660 In a
similar institutional study from Korea (in which costs are
expressed in thousands of Korean won, TW) that included
28 patients who underwent CEA and 19 patients who underwent CAS, procedure and resource costs were higher
in CAS patients (5122 6 674 TW vs 2622 6 332 TW; P <
.001), although total hospital costs were similar owing to
higher postprocedure costs among CEA cases. This reﬂected the excessive length of stay for both procedures,
but especially CEA patients, compared with contemporary American standards (9.4 6 3.0 for CEA vs 4.8 6
3.2 days for CAS).661 In another single institution study of
31 patients undergoing CAS and 31 patients undergoing
CEA, total direct costs for CAS and CEA were $8219 6
$2958 and $3765 6 $2170 (P < .001), respectively.662 The
largest single institution study reported to date included
174 patients who underwent CEA and 132 patients who
underwent CAS. Data showed that mean hospital costs
were $9426 6 5775 for CAS and $6734 6 3935 for CEA
(P < .0001). As in
