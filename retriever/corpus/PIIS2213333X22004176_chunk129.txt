ona phlebectatica; commonly
termed spider veins, they are distinguished from reticular veins by having no proﬁle; however,
telangiectasia, spider veins, and reticular veins are all classiﬁed as C1 using the CEAP
classiﬁcation

Tessari technique

Method of producing foam for immediate use by agitating liquid sclerosant with a gas at a
predeﬁned ratio using two interconnected syringes, which are pumped back and forth rapidly
w10 times until compact foam with microscopic bubbles is produced (named after L. Tessari,
Italy)

Varicose veins

Subcutaneous dilated vein $3 mm in diameter when measured in upright position; could involve
saphenous veins, saphenous tributaries, or nonsaphenous superﬁcial leg veins; varicose veins
will usually be tortuous, but tubular saphenous veins with demonstrated reﬂux can be
classiﬁed as varicose veins

Venous ablation

Removal, occlusion, or destruction of a vein by mechanical, thermal, or chemical means

Venous compression

Narrowing or occlusion of venous lumen as a result of extraluminal pressure

Venous occlusion

Total obliteration of venous lumen

Venous obstruction

Partial or total blockage to venous ﬂow

Venous reﬂux

DU changed intervention plan for 10%-25% of
cases; HHD had sensitivity only of 51%-77%
