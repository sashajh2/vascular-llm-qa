cial truncal and varicose veins using either physician-prepared sodium tetradecyl sulfate
or polidocanol foam made at the bedside using the Tessari technique,98,99 or commercially prepared polidocanol endovenous microfoam (PEM; Varithena; Boston
Scientiﬁc, Marlborough, MA).100 The Tessari technique is
used to prepare foam at the bed side, using a threeway stopcock and two syringes, mixing air with the liquid
sclerosing solution to create foam.98 Varicose tributaries
and tortuous superﬁcial truncal veins such as the accessory saphenous veins can be removed under local or
tumescent anesthesia using ambulatory phlebectomy
