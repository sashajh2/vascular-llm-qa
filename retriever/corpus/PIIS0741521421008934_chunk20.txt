patients. However, the study was not powered appropriately and failed to show the noninferiority of CAS
compared with CEA (P < .09).12 More recently, two large
randomized trials comparing CEA and TF-CAS for symptomatic patients were completed. The ICST (international
carotid stenting study trial) enrolled 1713 patients and

demonstrated an increased periprocedural stroke risk
with CAS (7.7%) compared with CEA (4.1%) in neurologically symptomatic patients.10 The observed difference
was statistically signiﬁcant (P < .002). The rate of any
stroke or death within 30 days after treatment in the
CAS group was more than twice the rate recorded for
the CEA group (7.4% vs 3.4%; P< .0004). In addition, the
composite endpoint of stroke, death, and MI signiﬁcantly
favored CEA (5.2%) vs CAS (8.5%; P < .006). These ﬁndings
were similar to those for the symptomatic patients
enrolled in the CREST (carotid revascularization endarterectomy vs stenting trial).9 In the CREST, the periprocedural rate of stroke and death was signiﬁcantly greater
after TF-CAS than after CEA for symptomatic patients
(6.0% 6 0.9% vs 3.2% 6 0.7%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.89;
95% CI, 1.11-3.21; P < .02). The rate of MI was lower after
CAS than after CEA for symptomatic patients (1.0% 6
0.4% vs 2.3% 6 0.6%; HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.18-1.11; P < .08);
however, the differences were not signiﬁcant. The CSTC
(Carotid Stenosis Trialists’ Collaboration) performed a
meta-analysis of
