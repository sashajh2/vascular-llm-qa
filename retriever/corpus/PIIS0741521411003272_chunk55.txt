months-28 years). The authors observed a healing rate of
93% in the treatment group vs 51% in the control group
(P ⬍ .001). The recurrence rate at 12 months was 24% in
the treatment group and 53% in the control group (P ⬍
.05). After additional compression treatment with the same
treatment protocol, all 16 recurrent ulcers in the treatment
group healed. In the control group, the healing rate of
recurrent ulcers was 89%. This study suggests that for
extensive and long-standing venous ulceration, multilayer
tubular compression therapy improves healing and decreases but does not prevent ulcer recurrence.
The Effect of Surgery and Compression on Healing
And Recurrence (ESCHAR) study156,157 randomized 500
patients with leg ulcers to compression treatment alone or
compression combined with superficial venous surgery.
Compression consisted of multilayer compression bandaging, followed by class 2 (medium compression, 18-24 mm
Hg, British Standard158) below-knee stockings. Superficial
venous surgery included saphenous vein ablation with high
ligation and stripping (HL/S) as well as avulsion of varicose
veins of the calf. General anesthesia could not be used in
25% of the patients, and in these, high saphenous vein
ligation alone was performed.
Compression treatment alone was as effective as compression with surgery to heal venous ulcers (65% vs 65%;
hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-1.24; P ⫽ .85), but
12-month ulcer recurrence rates were reduced in the compression with surgery group vs those with compression
alone (12% vs 28%; hazard ratio, ⫺2.76; 95% CI, ⫺1.78 to
⫺4.27; P ⬍ .0001). The difference in ulcer recurrence rates
persisted between the two groups at 4 years.159 A weakness
of the trial was that there was no surgical arm without
