 paresthesia 0.27 (P <
.0001), and for global symptoms 0.54 (P < .00001).
Ankle circumference and leg volume were signiﬁcant
reduced, and the study concluded that Ruscus extracts were effective in reducing symptoms and
edema in patients with CVD.16 In a meta-analysis,112
Ruscus extracts signiﬁcantly reduced ankle circumference vs placebo (P < .001), more so than diosmin.
Another systematic review and meta-analysis15 found
that Ruscus extracts were the most effective in
decreasing foot volume and ankle circumference.
4. Interventions for superﬁcial truncal reﬂux
4.1. Endovenous ablation vs high ligation and stripping.
4.1.1. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the GSV, who are candidates for

intervention, we recommend treatment with endovenous ablation over high ligation and stripping (HL&S)
of the GSV.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)
4.1.2. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the SSV, who are candidates for
intervention, we recommend treatment with endovenous ablation over ligation and stripping of the SSV.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
4.1.3. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the AAGSV or PAGSV, who are candidates for intervention, we suggest treatment with
endovenous ablation, with additional phlebectomy, if
needed, over ligation and stripping of the accessory
vein.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
4.1.4. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the GSV or SSV, we recommend
treatment with HL&S of the saphenous vein if technology or expertise in endovenous ablation is not available or if the venous anatomy precludes endovenous
treatment.
