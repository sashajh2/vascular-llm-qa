Endoleak. Endoleak is deﬁned as persistent blood ﬂow
in the aneurysm sac after EVAR. Endoleaks at the time of
repair may be present in up to 25%.634-636 Although an
endoleak may often resolve without intervention, some
require immediate or delayed treatment to prevent
aneurysm rupture. In addition, some endoleaks develop
months or years after EVAR. Thus, lifelong surveillance
after EVAR is required. An endoleak may be identiﬁed by
CT imaging or duplex ultrasound.637,638 There are four
main types of endoleak.371,639 Management depends on
endoleak type and the associated risk of sac rupture.
Type I endoleak. A type I endoleak occurs when
there is an incomplete seal at the proximal aortic attachment site (type IA) or at the distal iliac attachment site
(IA). A type IA endoleak most often occurs in the presence of a short or severely angulated neck or a reverse
tapered neck or when the attachment site contains
considerable thrombus or calciﬁcation. A type I endoleak
is associated with elevated sac pressure and an ongoing
risk of rupture.640-642

Whereas a small endoleak may seal and can be
observed, it is preferable that when a type I endoleak is
identiﬁed at the time of repair, every attempt should
be made to treat it before the conclusion of the procedure. Balloon molding of the proximal seal zone, placement of a proximal cuff, and endostaples have all been
used with varying degrees of success.643 Endostaples
may reduce the risk of endograft migration and a type
IA endoleak, but long-term data are limited.643,644
