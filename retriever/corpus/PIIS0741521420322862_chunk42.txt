symptoms (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 2.8-7.0; P < .001) despite no
difference in perioperative mortality or survival. Last,
Pecoraro et al112 (43 studies and 1795 patients) reported
lower perioperative morbidity and mortality in the endovascular group despite lower patency rates and no difference in survival. The similarity between the ﬁndings

among the various meta-analyses is not particularly surprising given the signiﬁcant overlap among the studies
that comprised the reviews. However, it is worth emphasizing that the meta-analysis that accompanied the
guidelines represents the most comprehensive and
extensive review in the literature and any discrepancy
with the other reviews is likely due to their small sample
size and the earlier dates of publication, before the widespread adoption of the endovascular approach.
The results of several recent clinical series comparing
the outcome of patients with CMI underscore the ﬁndings of the meta-analyses, but provide more granular information. Lejay et al35 reported their outcomes for open
revascularization during the endovascular era with a
