-4.5 cm) in group 1 and
2.2 6 0.8 cm (range, 1.3-4.0 cm) in
group 2 (P < .03); PAA thrombosis
was present in 7 of 20 limbs in group
2; 4 of these patients had ipsilateral
SFA thrombosis; evaluation of
infrapopliteal arteries in group 1
showed 3-vessel runoff in 7 limbs, 2vessel runoff in 3 limbs, 1-vessel runoff
in 2 limbs, and no vessel runoff in 2
limbs; all infrapopliteal arteries were
either occluded or signiﬁcantly
stenotic in 14 limbs (70%); in group 2,
1-vessel runoff was observed in 5
limbs, and 2-vessel runoff in 1 limb

Methodologic quality

Asymptomatic PAAs

Observation

42 Patients with mean PAA diameter of
3.1 cm (range, 1.8-8.0 cm); 1 or both
ankle pulses were absent in 18/42
limbs; during follow-up, 25/42
asymptomatic PAAs under
observation had complications at
mean observation of 18 months
(range, 1 day to 65 months); absent
ankle pulses at initial examination
signiﬁcantly predicted for natural
history of asymptomatic PAA; risk of
complications was also greater with
increasing diameter ($2 cm)

Retrospective study

Recommendation 4: For asymptomatic patients with a life expectancy of $5 years, we suggest open PAA repair, provided that an adequate
saphenous vein is present; for patients with a diminished life expectancy, if intervention is indicated, endovascular repair should be
considered (grade 2C)
