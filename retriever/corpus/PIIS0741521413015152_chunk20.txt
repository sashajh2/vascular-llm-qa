ABI, Ankle-brachial index; PVR, pulse volume recording; SPP, skin perfusion pressure; TP, toe pressure; TcPO2, transcutaneous oximetry.
Patients with diabetes should have TP measurements. If arterial calciﬁcation precludes reliable ABI or TP measurements, ischemia should be documented by
TcPO2, SPP, or PVR. If TP and ABI measurements result in different grades, TP will be the primary determinant of ischemia grade.
Flat or minimally pulsatile forefoot PVR ¼ grade 3.

Infection present, as deﬁned by the presence of at least 2 of the following
items:
d Local swelling or induration
d Erythema >0.5 to #2 cm around the ulcer
d Local tenderness or pain
d Local warmth
d Purulent discharge (thick, opaque to white, or sanguineous secretion)
