RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMAGING OF THE DTA
BEFORE TEVAR
The goal of this section is to review commonly available
aortic imaging modalities and their respective beneﬁts.
The most critical ﬁndings and clinical suggestions for
optimizing image evaluation are presented.
Chest radiography. Chest radiographs are particularly
prone to observational and interpretive errors. A study
analyzing common diagnostic errors, including aortic
disease, in radiology found that 44% of errors occurred
in interpreting plain ﬁlm radiographs, with 49% of these
involving chest radiographs.54,55
A large aneurysm alters the normal transverse dimension of the mediastinum and blunts the normal interfaces. Proposed radiographic criteria for a widened
mediastinum include a mediastinal width >8 cm or a
mediastinal to thoracic width ratio of $0.25. Other ﬁndings include a left apical “cap,” ﬂuid in the left hemothorax from a ruptured aneurysm, widening of the left
or right paraspinal line or right paratracheal stripe,
effaced aortic contour, anteroposterior window opaciﬁcation, tracheal deviation, left mainstem bronchus
depression, and deviation of a nasogastric tube to the
right of the T4 spinous process54-56
TAAs are typically located in the posterior mediastinum
and associated with the cervicothoracic sign. This sign is
based on the fact that the anterior mediastinum does
not extend above the clavicles. Therefore, any mediastinal mass extending above the level of the clavicle
with sharply deﬁned borders delineated by an air-soft tissue interface is located in the middle or posterior
mediastinum.57
