 fewer bleeding complications, and likely
have a role in the treatment of acute DVT. Surgical
thrombectomy typically uses a catheter-mounted compliant balloon to remove thrombus from the iliac veins
via a groin incision combined with techniques to remove
associated distal thrombus. Adjunctive construction of a
temporary arteriovenous fistula is commonly recommended to reduce early rethrombosis.15
Catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis is an
image-guided technique involving infusion of thrombolytic agents through a multi-side hole infusion catheter or
wire placed directly into a venous thrombus through a
remote puncture site.16 Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis
uses a number of catheter-based mechanical devices to
deliver the thrombolytic agent as well as to produce some
combination of thrombus fragmentation, distribution of
thrombolytic drugs throughout the thrombus, and/or
thrombus aspiration. These include rotational, rheolytic,
and ultrasound-assisted devices.17

The safe application of this technology requires careful
selection of those patients most likely to benefit from its
use, considering potential long-term disability, anatomic
distribution of thrombus, duration of symptoms, and the
risk of complications. Unfortunately, proving the efficacy of
these approaches in preventing the late manifestations of
the postthrombotic syndrome is substantially more difficult
than proving the efficacy of anticoagulants in preventing
recurrent VTE. Such trials require much longer periods of
follow-up and validated clinical and quality-of-life measures
rather than dichotomous outcomes such as recurrent VTE.
Nevertheless, recent data suggest that strategies of early
thrombus removal do indeed have a role in the management of acute DVT.18,19
The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and American
Venous Forum (AVF) formed a committee of experts in
venous disease to develop evidence-based clinical practice
guidelines regarding strategies of early thrombus removal
for acute DVT. The committee commissioned the conduct
of a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant
literature to inform their recommendations. In contrast to
previously published systematic reviews,20 this review was
confined to patients with iliofemoral DVT and excluded
systemic and locore
