Note
By the end of this chapter, students will:
 Review the foundational knowledge to appraise asymptomatic and symptomatic
carotid artery stenosis.
 Identify and describe risk factors, symptoms, and signs of carotid artery disease.
 Review and describe indications and contraindications for medical and surgical
management of carotid artery stenosis.
 Propose next best steps in patient work-up and treatment of carotid artery disease.
 Describe the evidence-based outcomes of surgical management of carotid artery
disease.
Key Facts
1. Stroke is the leading cause of disability nationally and 3rd leading cause of death
with a breakdown of 80% occlusive (ischemic) and 20% hemorrhagic.
2. Symptomatic carotid stenosis presents with only three symptoms including: stroke,
transient ischemic attack (TIA) and amaurosis fugax (transient retinal ischemia).
3. Risk factors include: age, smoking, CAD, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia
and genetic/family history.
4. Seminal studies include ACAS and NASCET. They define an 11% five-year risk of
stroke for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (>60%)
