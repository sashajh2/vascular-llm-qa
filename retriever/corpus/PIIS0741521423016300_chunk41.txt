intervention in people with diabetes and a foot ulcer.20
Modalities that can be used to obtain anatomical information include CDUS, CTA, MRA, or DSA (including
anteroposterior and lateral views of the foot). The
Writing Committee considered that each of the imaging techniques have their advantages and disadvantages, and their use will depend heavily on the
availability of equipment and local expertise, preferences of the individual clinician, and associated costs.
For these reasons a Best Practice Statement was
formulated. Regarding their use in people with diabetes, the utility of some these techniques, such as
CDUS and CTA, can be affected by (severe) MAC, which
is frequently present in the smaller arteries of the leg in
people with DFU. MRA images are incapable of
deﬁning the extent of calciﬁcation which may be
important when planning revascularisation.20 Finally,
as stated in the GVG, catheter DSA, represents the
gold standard imaging technique, especially for the

Recommendation 11
In a person with diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and a foot
ulcer or gangrene who is being considered for revascularisation, evaluate the entire lower extremity arterial circulation
(from aorta to foot) with detailed visualisation of the below
knee and pedal arteries.
