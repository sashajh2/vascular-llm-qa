Question 4: Screening high-risk patients (noncomparative studies)
Ahn et al,46 1991
USA

Carotid duplex scans
performed in the vascular
laboratory between 1985
and 1989. Patients who
underwent a screening
carotid duplex scan as
part of their initial
evaluation for PAD,
despite having no signs or
symptoms of any carotid
artery disease.

Scans performed for any
focal or nonfocal
neurologic symptoms
including TIAs, strokes,
amaurosis fugax, retinal
stroke, dizziness, vertigo,
syncope, tinnitus, blurred
vision, mental status
changes, eye pain, or even
headaches were
excluded. Scans that were
performed for any signs of
carotid artery disease
including a decreased
carotid pulse, cervical
bruit, pulsatile neck mass,
or Hollenhorstâ€™s plaque
were also eliminated.
Scans that were
performed in patients
