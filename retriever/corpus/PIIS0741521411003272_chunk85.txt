 of the RF catheter.
The laser fiber or RF probe is introduced through the
sheath into the GSV and advanced proximally to the SFJ.
The tip of the catheter is then positioned 1 cm distal to the
confluence with the superficial epigastric vein or 2 cm distal
to the SFJ. The patient is then placed in the Trendelenburg
position and the vein emptied by elevation and compression by instillation of perivenous tumescent anesthesia with
a diluted anesthetic solution (100-300 mL of the 500-mL
solution of 445 mL of 0.9N saline, 50 mL of 1% lidocaine
with 1:100,000 epinephrine, and 5 mL of 8.4% sodium
bicarbonate)232 into the saphenous subcompartment. The
vein can be further compressed by applying negative pressure in the side port with a 20-mL syringe. Tumescent
anesthesia enhances contact of the vein wall with the catheter or laser fiber for therapeutic effectiveness and provides
analgesia and a heat sink around the treated vein, thereby
decreasing heat-related injury to surrounding tissues,
which is reflected in a lower incidence of skin burns and
paresthesias.
The vein is then ablated in a retrograde fashion to just
above the puncture site. The laser fiber is withdrawn at a
rate of 1 to 2 mm/s for the first 10 cm and 2 to 3 mm/s for

the remaining distance. For optimal treatment, 50 to 80
J/cm energy is delivered when using the 810-nm diode
laser. With the RF catheter system, sequential heating of
the vein is performed at 7-cm intervals, heating the vein to
120Â°C in each 20-second cycle. The first segment is treated
twice. At the end of the procedure, the saphenous vein is
reimaged to confirm successful obliteration and absence of
thrombus protrusion into the femoral vein or, if the SSV
was treated, into the popliteal vein.
