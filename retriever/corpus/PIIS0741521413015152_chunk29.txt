Premises:
1. Increase in wound class increases risk of amputation (based on PEDIS, UT, and
other wound classification systems)
2. PAD and infection are synergistic (Eurodiale); infected wound + PAD increases
likelihood revascularization will be needed to heal wound
3. Infection 3 category (systemic/metabolic instability): moderate to high-risk of
amputation regardless of other factors (validated IDSA guidelines)
Four classes: for each box, group combination into one of these four classes
Very low = VL = clinical stage 1
Low = L = clinical stage 2
Moderate = M = clinical stage 3
High = H = clinical stage 4
Clinical stage 5 would signify an unsalvageable foot

to 48 possibilities. Quick perusal will note that many theoretically possible combinations are clinically unlikely, so the
actual number of probable scenarios is far more limited.
Most of the patients in the ischemia 1 and 2 blocks of 16
combinations suffer from “situational ischemia.” As wound
complexity and infection severity increase (a shift down and
to the right in each box of 16), the likelihood that revascularization will be required increases. In the ischemia 3 category, small wounds without infection may not always
require vascular intervention, but such an intervention
may speed healing. Again, shifts down
