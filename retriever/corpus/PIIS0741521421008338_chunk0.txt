ABSTRACT
Objective: To summarize the best available evidence comparing open vs endovascular popliteal artery aneurysm (PAA)
repair. We also summarized the natural history of PAAs to support of the Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines.
Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane databases, and Scopus for studies of patients with PAAs treated
with an open vs an endovascular approach. We also included studies of natural history of untreated patients. Studies
were selected and appraised by pairs of independent reviewers. A meta-analysis was performed when appropriate.
Results: We identiﬁed 32 original studies and 4 systematic reviews from 2191 candidate references. Meta-analysis showed
that compared with the endovascular approach, open surgical repair was associated with higher primary patency at 1 year
(odds ratio [OR], 2.10; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 1.41-3.12), lower occlusion rate at 30 days (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.24-0.68) and
fewer reinterventions (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.17-0.45), but a longer hospital stay (standardized mean difference, 2.16; 95% CI,
1.23-3.09) and more wound complications (OR, 5.18; 95% CI, 2.19-12.26). There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in
primary patency at 3 years (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.97-1.97), secondary patency (
