, and can be
quickly removed with cessation of the infusion. Intravenous nitroglycerin may be administered for myocardial
ischemia.
MI is the most frequent non-neurologic complication
of CEA. Beta blockers should be continued in patients
undergoing noncardiac surgery who have been on
these drugs chronically. It may be reasonable to begin
perioperative beta blockers for patients with intermediate or high risk for myocardial ischemia, or for patients with three or more Revised Cardiac Risk Index
risk factors such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, renal insufﬁciency, diabetes mellitus, or cerebrovascular accident. It is important to recognize that
initiation of any beta blocker therapy should be sufﬁciently in advance of surgery to assess safety and
tolerability.151 Perioperative beta blockade started
within 1 day or less before noncardiac surgery prevents
nonfatal MI, but increases risk of stroke, death, hypotension, and bradycardia.151
Several series have demonstrated that perioperative
statins are associated with signiﬁcant reductions in 30day stroke and death rates among patients undergoing
CEA.90-92 These ﬁndings are consistent with other studies
of patients undergoing an array of other vascular procedures. In a randomized clinical trial of patients undergoing
vascular surgical procedures, atorvastatin use was associated with a lower rate of perioperative stroke, MI, and
death152 and a meta-analysis identiﬁed a reduced rate
of perioperative mortality among vascular surgery patients who were on statins.153 In addition, an observational study of 780,591 patients undergoing noncardiac
surgery showed that risk-adjusted mortality was signiﬁcantly lower among patients taking a perioperative
statin.154 There is also some recent evidence suggesting
that patients taking statin medications at the time of

may have reduced rates of perioperative spontaneous
embolization compared with those not taking statins.155 These clinical beneﬁts may be partly due to
the anti-inﬂammatory and plaque-stabilizing pleiotropic effects of statin medications,156
