11.3. Treatment of varicose vein procedure related
DVT and ARTE
In patients with DVT after endovenous ablation, we
endorsed the recommendations of Stevens et al,
Antithrombotic Therapy for VTE Disease: Second Update of the CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel
Report. Chest. 2021; 160(6): e545-e608.253 The

evidence base for these guidelines was adopted
without review.
11.3.1. For patients with acute isolated distal DVT after varicose vein procedure, without severe symptoms
or risk factors for extension we suggest serial imaging
of the deep veins for 2 weeks.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)
11.3.2. For patients with isolated distal DVT after varicose vein procedure and severe symptoms or risk factors for extension we suggest anticoagulation.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
11.3.3. For patients with acute proximal DVT after
varicose vein procedure, we recommend anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant (over a vitamin K
antagonist).
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)
11.3.4. For patients with symptomatic ARTE after
endovenous ablation, we recommend anticoagulation
with a direct oral anticoagulant (over a vitamin K
antagonist).
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
11.4.1. For patients with asymptomatic ARTE III and
IV after endovenous ablation, anticoagulation with a
direct oral anticoagulant (over a vitamin K antagonist)
should be performed.
Consensus statement
11.4.2. For patients who receive anticoagulation for
ARTE following endovenous ablation, treatment
should be continued until the thrombus retracts.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. As discussed, routine screening of asymptomatic, average-risk patients for
