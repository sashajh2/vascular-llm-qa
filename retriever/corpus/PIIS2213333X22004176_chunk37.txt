Rationale. All the treatment modalities discussed in
this section can be used to successfully treat symptomatic reﬂux of the GSV (Fig 1). Surgical treatment includes high ligation of the GSV or SSV at the SFJ or at the
SPJ, respectively, and invagination stripping of the distal
portion of the vein with the patient under general
anesthesia or tumescent local anesthesia. Contemporary
surgical and endovenous procedures are universally
performed with DU assistance. Endovenous interventions, including thermal and nonthermal ablations, are minimally invasive percutaneous procedures
that can be performed in an outpatient setting. Thermal
ablation can be performed using laser technology with
different types and wavelengths of laser ﬁbers (endovenous laser ablation [EVLA])86,87 or can be performed
via radiofrequency ablation (RFA)64,88,89 using local
tumescent anesthesia. The most frequently used

devices in the United States include, among others,
the VenaCure 1470-nm laser system (Angiodynamics,
Waterlooville, UK) and the Closurefast RFA system
(Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN).
Nonthermal (and nontumescent) ablation methods
include endovenous cyanoacrylate closure (CAC; VenaSeal; Medtronic),12,90,91 the VariClose Vein Sealing System
(Biolas, Ankara, Turkey),92,93 and the MOCA (mechanicochemical ablation) procedure, using the ClariVein device
(MeritMedical, South Jordan UT).94-97 Ultrasound-guided
foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) can also be an effective
method to close superﬁcial truncal and varicose veins using either physician-prepared sodium tetradecyl sulfate
or polidocanol foam made at the bedside using the Tessari technique,98,99 or commercially prepared polidocanol endovenous microfoam (PEM; Varithena; Boston
Scientiﬁc, Marlborough, MA).100 The Tessari technique is
used to prepare foam at the bed side, using a threeway stopcock and
