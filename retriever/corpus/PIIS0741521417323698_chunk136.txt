Device migration. Device migration most commonly
presents as caudal migration of the proximal endograft.
A delayed type IA endoleak will occur if the endograft
migrates into the aneurysm sac. Rarely, aortic remodeling will create forces that cause cranial migration of
the distal landing zone and a resultant type IB endoleak.
Device migration is a late event, typically occurring 2
years or more after implantation.674-676 Factors that predispose to migration include hostile neck anatomy,
inadequate device ﬁxation, and progressive aortic dilation and elongation.674,677-679
Treatment for caudal device migration depends on
anatomic considerations, including the quality of the
aortic seal zone as well as the distance between the renal
arteries and the ﬂow divider of the original endograft.
Options include conversion to an aorto-unilateral iliac
bypass with crossover femoral-femoral bypass and iliac
occlusion or placement of an aortic extension cuff. However, the former approach has a lower risk of recurrent
endoleak and rupture because treatment with an aortic
cuff is often associated with continued risk of
