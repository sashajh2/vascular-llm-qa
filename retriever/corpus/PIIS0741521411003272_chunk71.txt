group and six from the cryostripping group were excluded
from analysis because of incomplete stripping. Experience
with this technique in the United States is limited, and at
this time no recommendation is made.
Results of superficial vein surgery on ulcer healing
and recurrence. High quality evidence indicates that superficial vein surgery reduces ulcer recurrence. The
ESCHAR study,156,157 as discussed earlier, randomized
500 patients with leg ulcers, who had isolated superficial
venous reflux or mixed superficial and deep reflux, to
compression treatment alone or to compression combined
with superficial venous surgery. Compression consisted of
multilayer compression bandaging, followed by class 2
below-knee stockings. Surgery included high ligation, division, and saphenous stripping. Rates of healing at 24 weeks
were similar in both groups (65% vs 65%; hazard ratio,
0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-1.24; P ⫽ .85), but 12-month ulcer
recurrence rates were reduced in the compression with
surgery group (12% vs 28%; hazard ratio, ⫺2.76; 95% CI,
⫺1.78 to ⫺4.27; P ⬍ .0001). The difference in ulcer
recurrence rates between the two groups at 4 years was
significant.157
Powered phlebectomy vs stab phlebectomy. A limited
number of studies, both retrospective and prospective, have
been performed. Overall, reported complications after
TIPP have varied considerably and include ecchymosis and
hematoma in 4.9% to 95%, paresthesias and nerve injury in
9.5% to 39%, skin perforation in 1.2% to 5%, superficial
phlebitis in 2.4% to 13%, swelling in 5% to 17.5%, hyperpigmentation in 1.2% to 3.3%, residual or recurrent varicose veins in 9.1% to 21.2%, and DVT in ⬍1%.174,210 In a
