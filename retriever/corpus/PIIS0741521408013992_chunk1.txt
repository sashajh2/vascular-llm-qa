 the role of monitoring and surveillance in arteriovenous access management, conversion of a prosthetic
arteriovenous access to a secondary autogenous arteriovenous access, and management of the nonfunctional or failed
arteriovenous access. For each of the guidelines, the panel stated the recommendation or suggestion, discussed the
evidence or opinion upon which the recommendation or suggestion was made, detailed the values and preferences that
influenced the groupâ€™s decision in formulating the relevant guideline, and discussed technical remarks related to the
particular guideline. In addition, detailed information is provided on various configurations of autogenous and
prosthetic accesses and technical tips related to their placement. ( J Vasc Surg 2008;48:2S-25S.)

Autogenous arteriovenous (AV) access for hemodialysis has been shown to be superior to prosthetic graft or
catheter access in terms of patient morbidity and mortality.
In addition, the maintenance of autogenous AV access is
less expensive than prosthetic conduits.1-5 Although several
reports have shown an autogenous AV access is feasible in
most patients in the United States, construction and utilization rates for autogenous AV access for hemodialysis in
this country are dramatically lower than in Europe and
