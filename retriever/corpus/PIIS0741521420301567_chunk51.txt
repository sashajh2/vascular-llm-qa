risk because of the risk of rupture.

We suggest observation over intervention for small (<2 cm), stable asymptomatic CAAs
or those in patients with signiﬁcant medical comorbidities or limited life expectancy.

Numerous case reports and series in the literature have
shown that a signiﬁcant proportion of CAAs present with
rupture. Therefore, an aggressive approach to their diagnosis and management certainly seems warranted. Reported mortality after ruptured CAA approaches 100%.
CAAs appear to have a strong tendency to rupture with
a resultant high mortality rate; it was reported that 33 of
34 patients with CAA diagnosed in 1943 died of rupture.115
The overall reported risk for rupture appears to range
from 10% to 20%.116,117 The majority of patients with
CAA have been described as symptomatic at presentation, although occult asymptomatic aneurysms are
more likely to be diagnosed radiologically in the current
era. Rupture has been reported to occur in approximately 5% of celiac trunk aneurysms ranging from 15 to
22 mm in diameter and in 50% to 70% of those that
exceed 32 mm in diameter.118,119
There are no absolute size criteria with which to direct
the indication for treatment; however, treatment of lesions
>2 cm seems appropriate. Despite this, in a reported series
of 18 CAAs in which nonoperative management was performed in 8 asymptomatic patients, only one subsequent
rupture was noted to occur.117 The other observed CAAs
had no evidence of enlargement or rupture during a
mean 91-month follow-up period.117 In patients with spontaneous dissection of the visceral arteries, aneurysmal
degeneration is rare.120,121 There is no evidence to suggest

tomatic at presentation as opposed to 30% of 20 true aneurysms. Pitton et al92 reported a review of 233 patients
with 253 visceral artery aneurysms. The rate of rupture
at presentation was noted to be signiﬁ
