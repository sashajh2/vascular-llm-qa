anesthesia, using a solution of 445 mL of 0.9% saline, 50

A rigid cannula with a light source can be used to inject
the tumescent solution and also to transilluminate the
subcutaneous tissues under the varicose veins.182 Injection
of the tumescent solution can be performed using a large
syringe or a Klein infiltration pump.181,183 Digital compression is applied immediately, and infiltration of the
wound with tumescent solution also provides good hemostasis. The skin incisions are usually approximated with
sterile adhesive strips, and compression is applied to the
extremity from foot to groin with an elastic compression
bandage or compression stocking.
Powered phlebectomy. Transilluminated powered phlebectomy (TIPP; Trivex, InaVein, Lexington, Mass), an
alternative technique for the removal of varicose veins, is
especially useful for the removal of larger clusters of varicosities.184,185 The potential advantages of TIPP include a
decrease in the number of incisions and much faster removal of a large amount of varicose vein tissue. Just as for
ambulatory phlebectomy, TIPP is often combined with
saphenous vein ablation procedures or stripping and ligation to eliminate the source of the reflux underlying a
varicose venous cluster formation. Instrumentation includes a central power unit with controls for irrigation
pump and resection oscillation speeds, an illuminator hand
piece that connects to the control unit using a fiber optic
cable and provides high-intensity light for transillumination
and delivery of tumescence irrigation, and a resector hand
piece that has 4.5-mm and 5.5-mm options.
