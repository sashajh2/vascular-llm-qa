 intervention if signiﬁcant stenosis is discovered. For
patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50% to 99%, who require both CEA and coronary artery bypass grafting,
we suggest CEA before, or concomitant with, coronary artery bypass grafting to potentially reduce the risk of stroke
and stroke/death. The sequencing of the intervention depends on the clinical presentation and institutional
experience. (J Vasc Surg 2022;75:4S-22S.)
