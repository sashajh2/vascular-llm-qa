Biomarkers and heritable risks for an AAA
Biomarkers for the presence and expansion of an
aortic aneurysm. The identiﬁcation of circulating
biomarkers for AAA disease remains an area of active
investigation. Such markers may assist in identifying
new targets for pharmacotherapy and may improve
both the diagnosis of AAA disease and monitoring of
the response to medical or surgical therapy. Among
biomarkers evaluated to date, ﬁbrinogen, D-dimer, and
interleukin 6 have been consistently associated with
the presence of AAA in multiple cross-sectional, casecontrolled studies.158 A meta-analysis has reported that
ﬁbrinogen, D-dimer, and thrombin-antithrombin III
complex levels are increased in patients with AAA.159
Matrix metalloproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of matrix
metalloproteinase 1, interleukin 6, C-reactive protein,
a1-antitrypsin, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein
A, and high-density lipoprotein are also differentially
expressed in patients with AAA. Whereas a linear correlation has been noted between C-reactive protein and
aortic diameter,160 this observation is at odds with at
least one prior report.161 A number of microRNAs related
to smooth muscle cell function and collagen formation
have also been suggested as possible AAA biomarkers.56,162-165 At the current time, none of these
candidates has the sensitivity, speciﬁcity, or rigorous
clinical validation to
