such tight blood pressure control and the risk of orthostatic hypotension is low. Both the ADA and ESC-EASD

stress the importance of individualised treatment as
overly aggressive blood pressure lowering is not without
risk in the usually elderly with a DFU and those with
multiple diabetes related complications and comorbidities. Therefore, in these people blood
pressures < 140/90 mmHg are recommended, but in
younger individuals (e.g., < 65 years) and with a small risk
of adverse effects of the treatment, lower target levels
might be considered.
Lipid goals. The ADA and EASD guidelines recommend in persons with diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease an LDL target of < 1.8 mmol/L (70
mmol/L).21 In line with the lower the better approach,
recent trials suggest that lower levels of LDL of < 1.4
mmol/L (55 mg/dL) can be beneﬁcial in persons with a
very high cardiovascular risk. Therefore, the recent ESCEASD and ESC-EAS guidelines recommend that such
very low LDL levels should be the target in these individuals.18,19 In those with recurrent events within two
years, even LDL levels < 1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) are suggested as target in ESC-EAS guidelines.19 With statin
therapy such as rosuvastatin 20 e 40 mg or atorvastatin
40 e 80 mg, marked reductions of LDL cholesterol can
be achieved if these relatively simple treatments are
tolerated. When the target is not reached ezetimibe can
be added, which is available in combination tablets with
both statins. These treatments have limited side effects
in most (but not all) people and are relatively inexpensive. According to the recent ESC-EASD and ESC-EAS
guidelines, an LDL level below 1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dL)
can be the target in people with recurrent cardiovascular
events (within two years), based on a limited number of
