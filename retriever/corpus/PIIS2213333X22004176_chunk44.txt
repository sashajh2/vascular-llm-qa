 and the committee strongly recommends high ligation and saphenous stripping, if the
technology or expertise is not available for an endovascular procedure or the anatomy favors surgery for patients
who are appropriate candidates for intervention.
Guideline 2.4.
2.4.1. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the GSV who place a high priority
on the long-term outcomes of treatment (QoL and
recurrence), we suggest treatment with endovenous
laser ablation, RFA, or high ligation and stripping
over physician-compounded UGFS.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak) quality of
evidence: B (moderate)
2.4.2. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the SSV who place a high priority
on long-term outcomes of treatment (QoL and recurrence), we suggest treatment with laser ablation,
RFA, or ligation and stripping from the knee to the upper or mid-calf over physician-compounded UGFS.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak) quality of
evidence: C (low to very low)

2.4.3. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the AAGSV or PAGSV who place a
high priority on long-term outcomes of treatment
(QoL and recurrence), we suggest treatment of the
reﬂuxing superﬁcial trunk with endovenous laser ablation, RFA, or high ligation and stripping, with additional phlebectomy, if needed, over physiciancompounded ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak), quality of
evidence: C (low to very low)
Rationale and evidence. This recommendation applies
only to physician-compounded UGFS when using it for
ablation of a superﬁcial truncal vein and does not
address the value of UGFS in the management of tributary varicosities. The recommendation is based largely on
evidence of a higher rate of recurrent varicosity, higher
risk of recurrent intervention, lower rate of occlusion of
the treated
