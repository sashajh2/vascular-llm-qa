Teaching Case
Scenario
A 75-year-old male is scheduled for an angiogram of the left lower extremity to investigate and
potentially treat claudication symptoms. The attending vascular surgeon, with over 25 years
of experience in endovascular therapy, takes precautionary measures by wearing a thyroid
shield, prescription glasses, and a 2-piece lead apron. However, due to challenges in navigating the stenosed arterial system, the fuoroscopy time during the procedure was extended.
Subsequently, the calculated radiation dose amounted to 3 Gy.
