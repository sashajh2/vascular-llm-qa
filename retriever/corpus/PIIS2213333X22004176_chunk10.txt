.3. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and
axial reﬂux in the anterior accessory or posterior
accessory great saphenous vein who place a high
priority on the long-term outcomes of treatment
(quality of life and recurrence), we suggest treatment of the reﬂuxing superﬁcial trunk with endovenous laser ablation, radiofrequency ablation, or
high ligation and stripping, with additional phlebectomy, if needed, over physician-compounded
ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak), quality of evidence: C (low to very low)

GUIDELINE 3.
3.1.1. For patients with symptomatic axial reﬂux of the great
saphenous vein, we recommend both thermal and
nonthermal ablation from the groin to below the
knee, depending on the available expertise of the
treating physician and the preference of the patient.
Level of recommendation: grade 1 (strong), quality of evidence: B (moderate)

3.1.2. For patients with symptomatic axial reﬂux of the
small saphenous vein, we recommend both thermal and nonthermal ablation from the knee to
the upper or mid-calf, depending on the available
expertise of the treating physician and the preference of the patient.
Level of recommendation: grade 1 (strong), quality of evidence: C (low to very low)
3.1.3. For patients with symptomatic axial reﬂux of the anterior accessory or posterior accessory great saphenous
vein, we suggest either thermal or nonthermal ablation, with additional phlebectomy, if needed,
depending on the available expertise of the treating
physician and the preference of the patient.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak), quality of evidence: C (low to very low)

GUIDELINE 4.
4.1.1. For patients with varicose veins (CEAP class C2) who
have signiﬁcant, symptomatic axial reﬂux of the great
or small saphenous vein, we recommend against
treatment of incompetent perforating veins
concomitant with initial ab
