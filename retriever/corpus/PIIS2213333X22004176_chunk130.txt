Doppler ultrasound (HHD) evaluation or other diagnostic methods
Domain

Evidence/panel input

Judgment

How substantial are desirable anticipated
effects of strategy?

DU changed intervention plan for 10%-25% of
cases; HHD had sensitivity only of 51%-77%

Large

How substantial are undesirable
anticipated effects?

No known undesirable effects; DU is a
noninvasive, safe, and convenient diagnostic
test

Trivial

Do the desirable effects outweigh the
undesirable effects?

Clear beneﬁts with DU and no undesirable
effects

Yes

Is there important uncertainty or variability
about how much people value the main
outcomes?

No available direct data

What is overall certainty of evidence of
effects?

In addition to available data, the
overwhelming opinion of experts supports
DU as evaluation method of choice for
patients with varicose veins

Moderate

How large are resource requirements
associated with intervention?

DU equipment already available in most vein
clinics, and cost is likely small relative to
overall cost of care

Small costs

How large is incremental cost relative to
net beneﬁt?

Strategy of DU evaluation already
implemented in vein clinics; the beneﬁt of
more precise diagnosis with DU could bring
only savings, although no cost-effectiveness
analysis is available

Unknown

What would be effects on health
inequities?

No available data

Unknown

Is option acceptable to key stakeholders?

Clear agreement also present among most
experts and practitioners about evaluating
patients with DU

Yes

Is option feasible to implement?

Because DU equipment already available at
most vein clinics, implementation should
not be difﬁcult

Yes

Probably no important
uncertainty or
variability
