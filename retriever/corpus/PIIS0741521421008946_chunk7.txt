 left hemisphere. If the left hemisphere is involved, patients may
demonstrate aphasia, alexia, anomia, and agraphesthesia. Nonspeciﬁc neurologic symptoms that are not typically associated with carotid territory thromboembolic
events include vertigo, ataxia, diplopia, other visual disturbances, dysarthria, decreased consciousness, weakness, syncope, and dizziness.3 Although imaging is
most often performed with a carotid duplex ultrasound
examination, among patients presenting with stroke,
the extracranial and intracranial vasculature may be
imaged simultaneously with computed tomography
(CT) or MRI studies.

Asymptomatic patients
Indications for imaging the carotid bifurcation in select
groups of neurologically asymptomatic patients are
controversial.3 Although statistically signiﬁcant in large
trials including the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS),28 the beneﬁt of CEA and other carotid
stenting interventions in preventing stroke in asymptomatic patients is much lower than among neurologically
symptomatic individuals. Moreover, the magnitude of
beneﬁt depends on the assumption that interventions
are performed with minimal morbidity. Populationlevel screening for asymptomatic carotid artery disease
is not currently recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force.29 The identiﬁcation of asymptomatic
patients with “screening” should therefore be limited to
high-risk individuals (see Clinical Practice Guidelines
document), or those with relevant ﬁndings on physical
examination or other imaging studies (ie, an audible carotid bruit, Hollenhorst plaque on fundoscopic examination, silent infarction on brain imaging examinations).
Among these patients, the most appropriate screening
test is a carotid duplex ultrasound examination.
The presence of an audible bruit in the neck may be an
appropriate indication for carotid imaging in selected
neurologically asymptomatic patients. Among patients
with a neck bruit, the prevalence of carotid stenosis of
more than 75% is 1.2%.30 However, the presence of a
neck bruit did not predict carotid stenosis of more than
60% in an asymptomatic patient population.30 These observations
