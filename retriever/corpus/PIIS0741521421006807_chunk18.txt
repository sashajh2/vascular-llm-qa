tomography angiography and magnetic resonance angiography can be used to identify the proximal and distal
extent of the PAA, assess arterial inﬂow and outﬂow, and
to plan the repair. Catheter-directed digital subtraction
angiography has mainly been used for ALI when thrombolytic therapy is needed, when evaluating for concurrent
endovascular repair, or to better assess a distal arterial
target for open repair using lower extremity bypass.
