forator Veins
For those patients who would beneﬁt from pathologic perforator vein ablation, we recommend treatment by percutaneous techniques that include
ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy or endovenous thermal ablation (radiofrequency or laser) over open
venous perforator surgery to eliminate the need for incisions in areas of compromised skin. [GRADE - 1;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Endovenous techniques, including radiofrequency
and laser ablations as well as foam sclerotherapy of perforating veins, have gained increasing acceptance because
of the minimally invasive nature of these interventions.23,342-344,346-348,350 Therapy can be repeated with
ease, risk of complications is minimal, and early to
midterm results in case series are equivalent to or better
than those reported after conventional perforating vein
interruptions.356-358 The risks of open procedures, which
speciﬁcally include infection, difﬁculty in healing of incisions required for treatment, increased local trauma, and
need for general anesthesia, set open operations apart
from these less invasive percutaneous methods. In one
of the larger series of 140 consecutive endovenous ablation procedures (74 superﬁcial and 66 perforator) on
110 venous ulcers in 88 limbs, there was measurable
and signiﬁcant reduction in ulcer size and ultimate healing after ablation of incompetent superﬁcial and perforator veins in patients for whom conventional
compression therapy had failed.337,348
Deep Venous Obstruction/Reﬂux and Venous Leg
Ulcer. For the following recommendations involving deep
venous obstruction or reﬂux, patients with VLUs being
evaluated for deep venous intervention should have already
been evaluated and treated for any superﬁcial or perforator
reﬂux per Guidelines 6.1 to 6.8. For the remaining
Guidelines 6.9 to 6.17, the status of the deep venous system is the only pathologic process requiring treatment. The
risks of open procedures, which speciﬁcally include infection,
difﬁculty in healing of incisions required for treatment,
increased local trauma, hematoma formation,
