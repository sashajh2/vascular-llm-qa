enosis only in the presence of
one or more risk factors that increase risk of late ipsilateral stroke. Those factors include stenosis progression, silent infarction on CTA/MRI, plaque echolucency,
intraplaque hemorrhage on MRI, large plaque area or
spontaneous embolization using TCD.10
Transfemoral CAS in asymptomatic lesions. Many
CAS studies have been in the form of “high-risk” registries.185,211-216 In 2004, the SAPPHIRE trial, which
included “high-risk” patients (70% of whom were
asymptomatic) demonstrated that stenting with cerebral protection devices was not inferior to CEA.201 The
primary end point of the study was 30-day cumulative
incidence of death/stroke/MI, which was 5.4% for
asymptomatic patients who underwent CAS and 10.2%
for CEA (P ¼.20). Critics of this study raised several
important issues, including the criteria used to deﬁne
high-risk patients for CEA, the failure to randomize more
than 50% of eligible patients, the unexpectedly high
incidence of postoperative strokedparticularly in
asymptomatic patientsdand questions about reporting
bias. Notably, MI was deﬁned only by enzymatic elevation. A number of critics suggested that the absolute
complication rates of both CAS and CEA in this study
could not be used to justify either intervention in
asymptomatic patients.217,218
CREST and Asymptomatic Carotid Trial (ACT-1) are two
recent multicenter randomized trials that enrolled significant numbers of individuals with asymptomatic carotid
artery stenosis. CREST showed that although stroke risk
with CAS was greater than that for CEA in asymptomatic
patients, the difference was not statistically signiﬁcant.
The actual risk between CAS and CEA in asymptomatic
patients for any periprocedural stroke was 2.5% vs 1.4%,
respectively, and any periprocedural stroke, death, or
postprocedural ipsilateral stroke was 2.5% vs 1.4%,
respectively. Results for
