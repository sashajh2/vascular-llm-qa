general anesthetics decrease the cerebral metabolic rate
and may therefore have a neuroprotective effect in the
presence of cerebral ischemia.225
Over the past several decades, a number of publications have shown conﬂicting results about anesthesia,
some favoring general anesthesia, while others favor
local anesthesia. Halm et al226 conducted a retrospective
analysis of 1972 patients undergoing CEA by 64 surgeons
in six New York hospitals in 1997 and 1998. Death or
stroke occurred in 2.3% in patients without carotid symptoms, 2.9% among those with carotid TIA, and 7.1%
among patients with perioperative stroke. Two surgical
techniques reduced the adjusted odds of death or
stroke: Use of local anesthesia (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.160.58) and patch closure (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24-0.76).
Stoner et al227 also reported outcome of 13,622 CEAs performed during a 3-year period at 123 Veteran’s Administration and 13 private academic medical centers. The
combined risk of stroke, death, or cardiac event was 4%
and stroke/death risk was 3.4%. Regional anesthesia
was used in 18% of cases with the following relative risk
reductions: stroke 17%, death 24%, cardiac events 33%,
and the composite outcome 31% (OR, 0.69; P ¼ .008).
The authors concluded that the use of regional anesthesia signiﬁcantly reduced perioperative complications,
however did admit the low use of regional anesthesia
may represent selection bias.
Results from randomized controlled trials, metaanalyses, and registries. One of the strongest Level 1 evidence sources on anesthesia is the General Anesthesia
vs Local Anesthesia for Carotid Surgery (GALA) trial.228
The two groups did not show any signiﬁcant differences regarding primary outcome (stroke, MI, or death)
