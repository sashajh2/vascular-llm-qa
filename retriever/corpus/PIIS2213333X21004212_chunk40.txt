 study124 compared color ﬂow duplex
scanning with venography and suggested that venographic reﬂux correlates best with duplex scan ﬁndings
of a reﬂux duration of greater than 0.5 second.
The second key question was about the effectiveness,
safety, and durability of HL/S compared with any endovenous ablation technique. To collect evidence, we
analyzed data of 30 RCTs26-60,100-108 and 16 observational
studies61-73,109e111 that included a total of 8830 patients
treated with HL/S, RFA, EVLA, USGF, CAC, MOCA, or Varithena foam for ablation of the incompetent GSVs or

SSVs. The quality of the studies differed to a great extent,
and eight RCTs,30,31,33,37,39-41,58,60 and one observational
study61 had a high risk of bias. The 30-day outcome
differences between interventions are important since
perioperative pain, wound complications, and AEs affect
the early QoL and rapid return to normal physical
activities. Signiﬁcant ﬁndings included a lower likelihood
of perioperative pain and less need for pain medications
for patients treated with EVLA compared with HL/S. Minor AEs were more frequent after HL/S vs RFA, but less
frequent than in patients who had UGFS. Diseasespeciﬁc QoL scores at 30 days were not different
between those who had RFA or HL/S. Early anatomic
closure rates were higher after HL/S vs RFA. Compared
with RFA, HL/S was signiﬁcantly associated with an
increased risk of minor AEs. At 1 year, those who
underwent UGFS had a higher risk of reintervention
than HL/S and had a higher risk of recurrent reﬂux. At
5 years, anatomic closure was the lowest among patients
who had UGFS. There was no difference in clinical
