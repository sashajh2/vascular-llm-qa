 compared to unexposed individuals. (Cioﬀ et al. 2020)
Given the potential implications of radiation exposure to thyroid disfunction and cancer, additional research into the long-term effects of ionizing radiation exposure on thyroid function
is warranted. Numerous studies have emphasized the need for further investigation in this
area.

Reproductive Function and Radiation Exposure
One of the significant concerns associated with radiation exposure is its impact on reproductive
health.


In the female reproductive system, ionizing radiation primarily affects the ovaries, potentially leading to:
1. Ovarian Insuﬀciency: Prolonged exposure to radiation may result in ovarian insuﬀciency, affecting the ovaries’ ability to function optimally.
2. Delayed Puberty: Radiation exposure can also contribute to delayed puberty in females.
3. Infertility: Ultimately, these effects may culminate in infertility.
Some sources suggest that radiation to the head during routine medical procedures could
disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. (Marci et al. 2018) This disruption may lead to hormonal dysregulation, further impacting reproductive health.
Radiation exposure to male reproductive organs can disrupt spermatogenesis, depending
on the stage of sperm development. The damage from ionizing radiation may lead to decreased
sperm motility, increased fragmentation, and DNA alterations. (Wdowiak et al. 2019)

Hematologic Disease and Radiation Exposure
Prolonged low-dose radiation exposure has the potential to cause serious hematological effects. Numerous studies, including those conducted outside the medical field, have examined
hematologicaly consequences of employees at risk of radiation exposure.
A particularly noteworthy study, published in 2015, involved an international cohort of observers within the nuclear industry. Their research revealed compelling evidence linking lowdose radiation exposure to the development of non-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). (Leuraud et al. 2015)
 Specifically, the study highlighted a direct correlation between cumulative red bone
marrow dose over a two-year period and the excess relative risk of developing leukemia.
 Their findings indicated that the relative risk of leukemia mortality was approximately
2.96 per Gy of exposure (RR = 2.94 per Gy).
While we won’t delve into the intricate details of these findings in this chapter, they underscore
