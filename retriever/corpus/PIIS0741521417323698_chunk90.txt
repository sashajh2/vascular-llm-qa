1). The need to convert from
EVAR to open repair decreased over time (2.2% in 2001
to 0.3% in 2008). Median length of stay was 2 days after
EVAR compared with 7 days after open repair (P < .001).
Endoleak. Type IA endoleak is noted in 6% of procedures at the time of implantation and may be due to
mural thrombus, calciﬁcation, angulation, neck tapering,
or excessive graft undersizing or oversizing.369-371 Initial
management is angioplasty with a compliant balloon,
followed by extension cuff placement. Additional
maneuvers include placement of a Palmaz (Cordis,
Bridgewater, NJ) balloon-expandable stent or endostapling.369,372 Conversion to open repair is not recommended unless rupture or signiﬁcant, uncorrectable
device maldeployment is noted. A type IA endoleak may
occasionally resolve after reversal of heparin and no
longer be evident on postoperative CT imaging.373 A
persistent type IA endoleak may be treated by placement of a fenestrated device,374,375 proximal cuff extension with chimney grafts to the renal arteries,376,377
external banding, embolization with coils or glue, or
conversion to open surgery. Insufﬁcient data exist to
recommend a particular strategy. A type IB endoleak is
treated initially by repeated balloon angioplasty and, as
needed, by graft extension. Coil embolization of the HA
may be required when the graft is extended into the
external iliac artery. A type II endoleak is common at the
time of implantation and is observed in 10% to 20% of
patients at 1-month follow-up on CT imaging.378,379
A type II endoleak is not treated at the time of implantation. A type III endoleak is treated by angioplasty of
component overlap sites or by placement of an additional conduit.380 A type IV endoleak is self-limited, and
treatment is not required.
