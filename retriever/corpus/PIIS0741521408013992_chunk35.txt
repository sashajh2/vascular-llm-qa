impact of AV access surveillance, followed by interventions
to restore patency.15 In this review, the surveillance strategy of nine studies (1363 patients) was compared with
clinical monitoring, with a vascular intervention to maintain or restore patency provided to both groups if needed.
Surveillance, followed by intervention, led to a nonsignificant reduction of the risk of access thrombosis (RR, 0.82;
95% CI, 0.58-1.16; I2 ⫽ 37%) and access abandonment
(RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.51-1.25; I2 ⫽ 60%). Three studies
(207 patients) compared the effect of vascular interventions
vs observation in patients with an abnormal surveillance
result. Vascular interventions after an abnormal AV access
surveillance result led to a significant reduction of the risk of
access thrombosis (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36-0.76) and a
nonsignificant reduction of the risk of access abandonment
(RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.43-1.37). Table II summarizes the
quality of evidence derived from this systematic review.
It is important to recognize that the value of surveillance strongly depends on the adequacy of clinical monitoring (physical examination and assessment of clinical
clues of access dysfunctions). Clinical monitoring by skilled
personnel was shown to have adequate diagnostic accuracy;
clinical monitoring has been reported to have positive
