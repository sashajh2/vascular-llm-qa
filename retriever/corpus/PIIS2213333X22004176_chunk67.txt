 great saphenous varicose veins and IPVs who had undergone either
standard surgery (high ligation and saphenous stripping
and phlebectomy) or standard surgery combined with
subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS). Of the 72
randomized patients, 38 had undergone SEPS (71% with C2
disease) and 32 had not (75% with C2 disease). At 1 year, the
SF-36 scores were not different between the two groups,
except for the bodily pain score, which had improved in the
SEPS group. The Aberdeen varicose vein questionnaire
score had improved in both groups. Although the visual
analog scale score for pain, mobility, and cosmetic
appearance had improved in both groups at 1 year (P < .05),
the improvement in mobility was only signiﬁcant in the
non-SEPS group (P < .05). Follow-up DU showed that IPVs
in the untreated leg were signiﬁcantly more frequent than
were those in the SEPS group.
The other study was by Park et al,201 who had randomized patients with C2 and C3 disease to either endovenous laser ablation of the IPVs in the thigh, followed by
ablation of the GSV below the IPV (n ¼ 34), or ablation
of the GSV starting just proximal to the thigh perforator
without ablation of the perforator vein (n ¼ 35). Technical
success was signiﬁcantly lower with ablation of the perforators (76.5%) compared with ablation of the GSV (100%;
P ¼ .002). However, no signiﬁcant difference was found in
clinical success (continued closure of treated vein) between the groups (1 week, 96.1% vs 100%; 1 month,
100% vs 97.1%; and 3, 6, and 12 months, 100% for both
groups). The investigators also reported no signiﬁcant differences in complications between the two groups at all
intervals.201
