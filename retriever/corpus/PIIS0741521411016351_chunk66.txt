4 Thrombolysis may
be given by systemic (intravenous) or local (intracranial)
routes, and both routes are used in some cases to facilitate
rapid reperfusion.234
Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator
(r-tPA) has the advantage of rapid onset of administration
but the potential disadvantage of longer time to reperfusion. Administration of r-tPA into the intracranial thrombus requires assembling a neurointerventional team and
therefore takes longer to implement but is more efficacious
than systemic therapy alone. Data suggest that about 30%
of patients will show neurologic improvement with intravenous r-tPA235 and that recanalization will occur in ⬎50%
of patients ⱕ6 hours when systemic lysis is supplemented
by local intra-arterial infusion.234
Mechanical thrombectomy, ultrasound-facilitated lysis,
and clot fragmentation or extraction have all been proposed
as methods to accomplish rapid reperfusion without the
increased risk of hemorrhage associated with chemical
thrombolysis.236-238 Experience at this time is limited. The
role of extracranial intervention in the form of CAS or CEA
must be considered in the context of the treatment of
intracranial thrombosis or obstruction. Angioplasty and
stenting of the extracranial ICA may be performed as an
adjunct to intracranial therapy. Treatment of extracranial
disease offers the potential advantages of preventing further
embolization from the extracranial carotid atherosclerosis,
increasing perfusion to the ischemic penumbra surrounding the area of cerebral infarct, enhancing arterial flow to
augment clot-dissolution therapies, improve access for intervention on the intracranial lesions, and potentially improve the patency of the intracranial intervention. The use
of CAS as an adjunct to intracranial catheter-directed therapies has been evaluated in several case series.239 Although
the results initially reported have been favorable, the overall
experience has been limited.
b. Presentation later than 6 hours. Only about 15% of
acute stroke patients will present within the 6-hour time
window for acute intervention.240 Reasons for delay
