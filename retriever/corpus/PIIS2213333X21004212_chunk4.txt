 management of chronic venous
disease and the supporting evidence for the guidelines.
The purpose of this analysis is to provide information
pertinent to updating the guidelines speciﬁcally with
regard to management of varicose veins.

METHODS
This systematic review follows an a priori protocol
developed by a committee from the SVS and AVF
responsible for developing clinical practice guidelines
on the management of varicose veins. This report
complies with the PRISMA statements.15
Eligibility criteria. The committee prioritized four key
questions presented using the PICO format (patient,
intervention, comparison, outcomes) accompanied by
the eligibility criteria in Table I.
The four questions addressed the following: Question 1,
The diagnostic usefulness of DUS in adults with varicose
veins (C2-C6); question 2, surgical stripping vs any
endovenous ablation technique in patients who have
identiﬁed varicose vein and axial saphenous vein incompetence; question 3, thermal vs nonthermal technique
outcomes in patients with varicose veins who underwent
endovenous ablation treatment of an incompetent
superﬁcial axial saphenous vein; and question 4, outcomes of incompetent perforator veins ablation vs no
perforator ablation in patients with simple varicose veins
(clinical, etiological, anatomic, pathophysiological

classiﬁcation [CEAP] class C2) with or without axial superﬁcial saphenous or other truncal (axial) vein ablation.
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and
comparative observational studies that enrolled at least
10 adult patients (aged $18 years) with primary varicose
veins (CEAP class 2-6).16 We included diagnostic studies
where patients were evaluated for GSV incompetence using DUS compared with other diagnostic test modalities
such as physical examination, complemented by plethysmography, computed tomography scan or MR imaging,
venogram, and hand-held Doppler (HHD). We also studied treatment modalities separately in patients with varicose veins (CEAP class 2-6) and compared the outcomes
of different procedures. The procedures included open
surgery (high ligation and stripping [HL/S], saphenectomy,
or
