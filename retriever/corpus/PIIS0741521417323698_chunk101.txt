the presence of iliac aneurysmal disease, the distal
anastomosis should be performed immediately proximal
to the iliac bifurcation to reduce the risk of late
aneurysmal degeneration. Patients with symptomatic
aortoiliac occlusive disease may beneﬁt from distal graft
anastomosis to the distal external iliac or common
femoral arteries. However, graft extension to the femoral
arteries increases the risk of wound infection, limb thrombosis, and anastomotic aneurysm formation.419 Assuming
that normal iliac arteries have been selected for the distal
anastomosis, the risk of progressive distal aneurysmal or
occlusive iliac disease is relatively low.418,421
We recommend straight tube grafts for OSR of AAA in the
absence of signiﬁcant disease of the iliac arteries.

remains a risk factor.422 The IMA is occluded in 40% to
50% of the patients with aortic disease because of ostial
atherosclerosis or mural thrombus. The value of routine
reimplantation of a patent IMA has not been established,
but selective reimplantation may be of value in the presence of compromised pelvic perfusion, particularly when
the marginal artery is interrupted because of prior colectomy.403,423 A prospective randomized study suggested
that IMA reimplantation is beneﬁcial in patients of
advanced age and when intraoperative blood loss has
been substantial.424 Likewise, reimplantation of the IMA
should be considered in patients with underlying celiac
and SMA occlusive disease, particularly in the presence
of a large meandering artery. The IMA can be easily
controlled before opening the aneurysm by a vessel
loop and reimplantation to an aortic graft performed
using a Carrel patch technique, in which a small button
of aortic wall is dissected free from adherent thrombus
and calciﬁc debris. In the Canadian aneurysm trial, IMA
re
