aged between 40 and 49 years, 2.5% in patients aged between 50 and 59 years, 4.7% in patients aged between 60
and 69 years, and 14.5% in patients aged >69 years.8 The
prevalence of PAD is expected to increase in the United
States and worldwide as the population ages, cigarette smoking persists, and the epidemics of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity grow.7
A recent meta-analysis of 34 studies that examined the
prevalence and risk factors of PAD worldwide shattered
some preconceived notions related to this disease.5 With a
conservative estimate of >202 million afﬂicted with this disease globally, this analysis showed a relative increase in PAD
prevalence of 23.5% during the ﬁrst decade of the new millennium. The most striking increases in prevalence were
seen in low-income and middle-income countries (28.7%),
although signiﬁcant growth was also evident in highincome countries (13.1%). In high-income countries, PAD
prevalence is equal between women and men, whereas in
low-income and middle-income countries, PAD prevalence
is higher in women, especially at younger ages. Increased
longevity (age), smoking, and diabetes are the most strongly
associated risk factors across all nations.
The economic effect of this growing burden of PAD is
being experienced acutely in the United States and in many
other industrialized nations. In 2001, the U.S. Medicare program spent an estimated >$4.3 billion on PAD-related treatment.7 PAD-related treatment accounted for w13% of all
Medicare Part A and B expenditures for patients undergoing
treatment for PAD and for 2.3% of total Medicare Part A and
B expenditures during that year. These Medicare costs have
continued to increase markedly. Analysis of data from the
Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health
(REACH) Registry estimated total costs of vascular-related
hospitalizations was $21 billion in the United States in
2004, with most costs associated with revascularization procedures.10 Given the ongoing dramatic increases in the use of
invasive treatments, these ﬁgures are likely underestimates of
the current costs
