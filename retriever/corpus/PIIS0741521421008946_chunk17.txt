-55),
and stroke reduction was proportional to the reduction in
systolic blood pressure.57 In addition, a meta-analysis of
147 randomized clinical trials of hypertensive therapy
among patients with a history of stroke demonstrated a
signiﬁcant relative risk reduction in stroke incidence with
antihypertensive therapy (34%; 95% CI, 15-32).57
However, there is no convincing evidence supporting
systemic blood pressure decreased in the acute phase
of a stroke; in fact, this may be potentially harmful
among patients undergoing CEA. In one report, the
beneﬁt of preoperative blood pressure reduction
increased stroke risk among recently symptomatic patients with bilateral 70% or greater ICA stenosis.58 In
contrast, severe hypertension, deﬁned as a systolic blood
pressure of greater than 180 mm Hg should be treated to
decrease the risk of postoperative hyperperfusion syndrome,
intracranial
hemorrhage,
and
surgical
bleeding.59,60 Similarly, severe hypertension is associated
with risk of hyperperfusion syndrome and intracranial
hemorrhage after CAS procedures.61 Post-CAS hypertension and hypotension are both associated with increased
risk of periprocedural stroke and mortality. In an analysis
of 5263 patients who underwent CAS in the Vascular
Quality Initiative (VQI), beta blocker use for more than
30 days decreased the stroke/death rates after CAS,
although the beneﬁt may not have been related exclusively to blood pressure lowering.62
Similar to the general population, among patients with
asymptomatic carotid disease or a remote symptomatic

history, a blood pressure target of 140/90 mm Hg was
accepted for some time as the standard. However, this
target level was recently lowered to 130/80 in the 2017
guidelines released by the AHA and the American College of Cardiology.63
In addition to its clinical beneﬁt, reduction of elevated
blood pressure also has been demonstrated to have beneﬁts pathologically. Several trials showed that elevated
blood pressure is associated with development of carotid
atherosclerosis,64-66 and
