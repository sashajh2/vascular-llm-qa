 evidence to date
that combination therapy is a more effective treatment for
PAD than a single agent, and bleeding risks are increased.84
Warfarin has been demonstrated to reduce myocardial
infarction or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease,
although at the cost of a 4.5-fold increase in major
bleeding.85,86 There is no evidence that warfarin decreases
the likelihood of adverse events related to PAD alone. Only
one prospective trial exists comparing the effect of warfarin
vs aspirin on graft patency. A similar number of graft occlusions occurred in both study cohorts, with a twofold
increased risk of major bleeding in the warfarin cohort.85
Homocysteine-lowering drugs. Approximately 30% of
patients with known PAD have elevated serum levels of homocysteine compared with 1% in the general population.9 Folic
acid and cobalamin (vitamin B12) have been found to reduce
serum homocysteine levels by 25% and 7%, respectively, in
clinical trials. However, there are no data demonstrating that
reducing homocysteine serum levels decreases the likelihood
of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with PAD,87
although clinical trials are ongoing.87-89 Pending the outcomes of prospective trials, treating hyperhomocysteinemia
with folic acid to reduce serum levels to <10 mmol/L is
generally safe and well tolerated but is of no proven beneﬁt.
4B. Pharmacotherapy for patients with IC to improve
leg function
Medical management of IC is aimed at symptom relief
(Table II) and slowing the progression of atherosclerotic disease. A number of drugs have been evaluated for use in patients with IC, but in the United States, there are currently
only two Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
medicationsdcilostazol and pentoxifylline.90-92 Of note, a
recent review by the Royal College of Physicians in the
United Kingdom identiﬁes naftidrofuryldwidely available
in Europe but not FDA-approved in the United Statesdas
the drug of choice over both cilostazol and pentoxifylline
in the medical management of symptomatic PAD.93,
