 peak systolic velocity of
230 cm/second and an end-diastolic velocity of greater
than100 cm/second, or a peak systolic velocity ratio between the internal and CCA of greater than 4 can be
used to predict a stenosis of greater than 70%.42,46 Using
these criteria, the reported sensitivity, speciﬁcity and accuracy of duplex in predicting 50% to 69% or a more
than 70% stenosis are 93%, 68%, and 85% and 99%,
86%, and 95%, respectively.42 Many surgeons have raised
their threshold for intervention for asymptomatic carotid
stenosis to 80% or greater. Typical duplex criteria to identify stenosis at this level include an end diastolic velocity
of more than 140 cm/second.47
The major limitations of duplex ultrasound examination include dependence on a skilled operator and the
inability to completely image the proximal and intracranial vasculature. Certain anatomic features such as severe vascular calciﬁcation and arterial tortuosity can
also decrease the accuracy of duplex imaging.3
MR angiography. Current contrast-enhanced MR angiography (MRA) can provide three-dimensional images,
which can rival those of formal arteriography.40 The main
advantages of MRA include the absence of radiation and
the avoidance of iodinated-based contrast materials.
Additionally, MRA can be combined with MR brain imaging to delineate clinically silent cerebral infarction, and
it can also evaluate plaque morphology, particularly the
presence of intraplaque hemorrhage.48 However, bony
landmarks are not typically present on the resulting images, and calciﬁcation of the vessels or plaque is not wellidentiﬁed.40 Nevertheless, MRA has become widely used
in evaluating patients with carotid artery disease. It can be
used in combination with an initial duplex ultrasound
scan for the planning of carotid artery intervention.
Contrast-enhanced MRA using gadolinium has been
shown to be the most accurate noninvasive imaging modality for evaluation of carotid stenosis.39 However, MRA
has no role in screening for carotid artery disease owing
to its
