 the
very low-quality evidence, the committee placed a higher
value on avoiding harm associated with late access construction and a lower value on potential harms and costs
associated with early referral and early access placement.
Early referral should encourage placement of autogenous
access; however, whether the autogenous access prevalence
rate can be increased to reach 66% by 2009, as desired by
CMS,8 is currently uncertain.

1.3. Technical remarks
It is generally agreed that all new hemodialysis patients
should have the most optimal permanent vascular access
that can be successfully used at the time of initiation of
dialysis therapy. For this to happen, the patient must see a
nephrologist before initiation of dialysis to facilitate the
referral to an access surgeon, and the surgery must be
performed in enough time before dialysis initiation to allow
for maturation, revision, and repeat procedures if the first
attempt is unsuccessful.
Referral for initial vascular access placement should
ideally occur approximately 6 months in advance of the
anticipated need for dialysis. Because of the difficulty of
predicting timing of onset of hemodialysis in an individual
patient, it is recommended that referral for initial access
placement should occur when the estimated GFR (eGFR)
level drops ‚¨ç20 to 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 (stage 4 CKD) in
a patient expected to start hemodialysis. However, referral
decisions should be individualized to reflect differences in
rates of actual and predicted decline in eGFR, in the competing risk of death, and in patient preferences.
In the United States, most patients who start dialysis do
not have a functioning permanent vascular access (autogenous or prosthetic) in place at the time dialysis is initiated, and
thus a catheter must be used for dialysis until permanent access
is placed and ready to be used.20,21 Many patients are not
referred to a nephrologist until their kidney disease is already
quite advanced, allowing little opportunity for vascular access
placement before dialysis is initiated.17,22,23
Not surprisingly, patients who are referred to nephrologists before the initiation of dialysis are more likely to
undergo vascular access surgery before dialysis begins.24
