 in
3% to 10% of patients,178,201 with reported wound infection rates as low as 1.5% and as high as 16%.202-204 An RCT
by Biswas et al205 evaluated the efficacy of the duration of
compression therapy in 300 postsurgical patients. The
study found no benefit in wearing compression stockings
for ⬎1 week after uncomplicated HL/S of the GSV with
respect to postoperative pain, number of complications,
time to return to work, or patient satisfaction for up to 12
weeks after surgery.205
In a recent RCT that included 443 patients who underwent groin surgery for varicose veins, the risk of wound
infections and wound-related complications was reduced
with use of a single dose of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis.206 Wound outcomes were worse with higher body
mass index (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.97; P ⫽ .005) and
with current smoking (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9; P ⫽
.033).206
Nerve injury. Using conventional stripping techniques, the incidence of saphenous nerve injury in one
study was 7% in patients who had stripping to the knee and
39% in those who had stripping to the ankle.165 Sural nerve
injury occurred at a rate of 2% to 4%. Common peroneal
nerve injury occurred in 4.7% in one series and in 6.7% in
another series in those patients who underwent SSV ligation or stripping.207
Injury to the femoral artery and vein. Injury to the
femoral vein or artery during high ligation of the saphenous
vein is, fortunately, very rare. Consequences can be disastrous, because most are not recognized immediately,208
and a delay in treatment may result in massive DVT or even
loss of the limb from the severe arterial injury.
Thromboembolic complications. DVT and pulmonary
embolism (PE) are rare but occasionally serious complications
