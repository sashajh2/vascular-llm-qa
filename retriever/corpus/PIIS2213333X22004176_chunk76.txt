Guideline 5. Ablation of the reﬂuxing symptomatic
superﬁcial venous trunk and concomitant treatment
of varicose tributaries
Guideline 5.1.
5.1.1. For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the GSV
or SSV and associated varicosities, we recommend
ablation of the reﬂuxing venous trunk and concomitant phlebectomy or UGFS of the varicosities with
physician-compounded foam or commercial PEM.
Level of recommendation: grade 1 (strong); quality of
evidence: C (low to very low)
5.1.2. For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the
AAGSV or PAGSV, we recommend ablation of the reﬂuxing venous trunk and concomitant phlebectomy or UGFS
of the varicosities with physician-compounded foam or
commercial PEM.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak), quality of
evidence: C (low to very low)
Rationale. In patients with both truncal vein reﬂux and
incompetent tributaries, the decision regarding optimal
treatment must involve the scientiﬁc evidence, the patient’s wishes and concerns, and a well-informed physician providing advice. The common scenario of calf or
thigh tributaries emanating from an incompetent truncal vein treated in a single session will usually be the
more cost-effective approach and has been associated
with less total time off from work. In situations in which
nonsaphenous varicose tributaries are also present in the
leg, concomitant treatment with phlebectomy or UGFS
would be more appropriate. Other situations such as
transportation needs or caregiver restraints would also
favor concomitant treatment.
Evidence. Harlander-Locke et al207 performed a retrospective review of 1000 consecutive RFAs of truncal veins
(916 limbs with class C2-C6). Five hundred seven limbs
had large (>3mm) symptomatic varicose tributaries of
which 355 (70%) underwent concomitant phlebectomy,
145 (25%) limbs had staged phlebectomy. Twenty-six
