 this metanalysis. Gillet et al205 evaluated the side-effects and complications of
FS in a prospective, multicenter study of room air vs oxygen FS in 1025 patients. The incidence of migraine was
0.78% (with aura 0.59%, 0.19% without aura), VD 0.68%,
chest tightness 0.68%, chest tightness with VD 0.49%
and transient ischemic attack occurred in 0.1%.
In summary, while theoretically CO2 foam supposed
to improve safety proﬁle compared with room air, the
data is limited, and the studies support both methods
of FS (Table XVIII). In addition, room air foam is more

outcome.
7.2.5. There is currently no clinical study of sclerotherapy with PCF, prepared using the Tessari method, that
shows that it is less safe or effective than PEM.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. PEM, used for treatment of truncal veins and
varicose tributaries is a promising product that appears
to be more stable and cohesive, with a narrow bubble
size distribution compared with physician compounded
foam, used for sclerotherapy of varicose tributaries and
superﬁcial truncal veins.
Evidence. As articulated in the statement, there is no
clinical evidence that sclerotherapy with PC
