 In the
surgical arm, patients received the same lifestyle advice but
also underwent high ligation, stripping, and phlebectomies. In the first 2 years after treatment, there was a
significant QOL benefit for surgery of 0.083 qualityadjusted life-years (QALY; 95% CI, 0.005-0.16 QALY)
based on the SF-6D score (derived from scores on six
domains of the SF-36) and 0.13 QALY (95% CI, 0.0160.25 QALY) based on the EQ-5D score (a five-dimension
descriptive system of health-related QOL). Considerable
benefits were also seen in symptomatic and anatomic measures. The authors concluded that surgery provides more
symptomatic relief and improvements in QOL than conservative management with compression hosiery and lifestyle modifications in patients with uncomplicated varicose veins.
The cost-effectiveness of conservative vs surgical therapy or sclerotherapy in patients with varicose veins was also
studied in the REACTIV trial.144 Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that surgery was significantly more cost-effective
than both sclerotherapy and conservative management;
sclerotherapy was less cost-effective than surgery but was
still significantly more cost-effective than conservative
treatment.
The need for a period of compression treatment before
any intervention for simple varicose veins has been surrounded
by controversy. Although third-party payers often require a
trial of compression stockings, there is virtually no scientific
evidence to support such a policy when saphenous ablation
to treat superficial reflux is both more efficacious and

cost-effective, a fact supported by data of the REACTIV
trial. In addition, some patients, such as the obese or the
elderly, may have difficulties applying an elastic stockings.138 One study of predominantly elderly (mean age, 72
years) women with CVD found that 15% could not apply
elastic stockings and 26% needed considerable help to do
so.145 On the basis of the available evidence, the Guideline
