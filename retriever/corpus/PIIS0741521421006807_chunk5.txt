20 to 30 mm
grew 3 mm/y, and those >30 mm grew 3.7 mm/y. The
most recent retrospective analysis of 87 asymptomatic
PAAs demonstrated that smaller size aneurysms may
demonstrate a slower growth rate for a number of years
before an accelerated growth phase occurs,16 conﬁrming
previous observations that PAAs with greater diameters
will enlarge more rapidly than those with smaller diameters.12-14,16,17
Most patients with PAAs will be asymptomatic at the
time of detection. In a review of multiple studies, totaling
>4000 patients, ~40% of patients were asymptomatic at
repair.2 Among asymptomatic patients with PAAs, 14%
to 24% will become symptomatic within 1 to 2 years and
31% to 68% will develop complications during the patient’s lifetime.15,18-20 Symptoms usually result from acute
or chronic limb ischemia caused by distal embolism to the
tibial runoff vessels with or without associated aneurysm
thrombosis.21 The progression to PAA thrombosis has
been associated with inﬂow and/or outﬂow occlusion.22
Patients presenting with a thrombosed PAA can have severe limb ischemia owing to disruption of the collateral
circulation and loss of outﬂow vessels owing to chronic silent thromboemboli that often precede the acute event.
These patients require an expeditious diagnosis and treatment to prevent limb loss. In a systematic review of 895
cases of acute limb ischemia (ALI) due to PAA, the early
amputation rate was 14%.23 Patients presenting with
chronic symptoms can be clinically indistinguishable
from those presenting with atherosclerotic arterial occlusive disease. A high index of suspicion is, therefore, necessary to distinguish patients with chronically symptomatic
PAAs from those with symptoms due to peripheral arterial
occlusive disease (PAD). PAAs can also present with
rupture, although this is rare.1 Compressive symptoms
resulting in venous congestion, leg swelling, deep vein
thrombosis, and/or neuropathy have also been reported
but are very uncommon.
