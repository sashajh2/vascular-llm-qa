patients with C2 disease vs no treatment
Domain

Evidence/panel input

Judgment

How substantial are the desirable
anticipated effects of the strategy?

Not substantial; intervention for IPVs does not improve
hemodynamic status, clinical presentation, or QoL
compared with treatment of superﬁcial reﬂux alone;
treatment, however, might have a role for patients
with persistent symptoms after superﬁcial venous
surgery with persistent superﬁcial reﬂux or initial
presence of deep venous reﬂux

Trivial

How substantial are the undesirable
anticipated effects?

Not substantial; undesirable effects such as venous
thrombotic events, skin/soft tissue injury, and nerve
injury are possible

Trivial

Do the desirable effects outweigh the
undesirable effects?

They do not, given the lack of signiﬁcant evidence to
proceed with intervention for IPVs in C2 disease and
the potential for undesirable effects

Probably no

Is there important uncertainty or
variability about how much people
value the main outcomes?

Unknown; intervention for IPV treatment in C2 disease
might result in over- or undertreatment

Unknown

What is the overall certainty of the
evidence of effects?

Data are derived from many prospective cohort studies,
with limited data from randomized clinical trials

Low

How large are the resource
requirements associated with the
intervention?

It could lead to added costs to the index procedure

Moderate costs

How large is the incremental cost
relative to the net beneﬁt?

Unknown

Unknown

What would be the impact on health
inequities?

Unknown

Unknown

Is the option acceptable to key
stakeholders?

Unknown

Unknown

Although it might be feasible, routine treatment of IPVs
in patients with C2 disease does not have a
documented beneﬁt

Probably yes

Is the option feasible to implement?

CAC, Cyanoacrylate closure.
