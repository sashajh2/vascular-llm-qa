 OSR or EVAR.
Level of recommendation

1 (Strong)

Quality of evidence

A (High)

We suggest thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated or
low-molecular-weight heparin for patients undergoing
aneurysm repair at moderate to high risk for venous
thromboembolism and low risk for bleeding.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

Postoperative blood transfusion. In the absence of
ongoing blood loss, we suggest a threshold for blood
transfusion during or after aneurysm repair at a hemoglobin concentration of 7 g/dL or below.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

Perioperative pain management. We recommend
multimodality treatment, including epidural analgesia,
for postoperative pain control after OSR of an AAA.
Level of recommendation

1 (Strong)

Quality of evidence

A (High)

Late outcomes. We recommend treatment of type I
endoleaks.
Level of recommendation

1 (Strong)

Quality of evidence

B (Moderate)

We suggest no treatment of type IV endoleaks.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

We recommend open repair if endovascular intervention fails to treat a type I or type III endoleak with
ongoing aneurysm enlargement.
Level of recommendation

1 (Strong)

Quality of evidence

B (Moderate)

We suggest open repair if endovascular intervention
fails to treat a type II endoleak with ongoing aneurysm
enlargement.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

We suggest treatment for ongoing aneurysm expansion, even in the absence of a visible endoleak.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

We recommend that follow-up of patients after aneurysm repair include a thorough lower extremity pulse examination or ankle-brachial index (ABI).
Level of recommendation

1 (Strong)

Quality of evidence

B (Moderate)

We recommend a prompt evaluation for possible graft
limb occlusion if patients develop new-onset lower extremity claudication, ischemia, or reduction in ABI after
aneurysm repair.
Level of recommendation

1 (Strong)

We suggest treatment of type II endoleaks associated
