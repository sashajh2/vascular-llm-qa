178,179 MRA may also be considered. Axial imaging of the abdomen will facilitate the assessment of
other abdominal aneurysms, which are common as
referenced before. Arteriography is invaluable for aneurysm identiﬁcation preoperatively and in operative planning, and it is mandatory for patients with polyarteritis
nodosa to assess for additional aneurysms.180
Aneurysms of the jejunal, ileal, and colic arteries are
associated with medial degeneration, infection, inﬂammation, various autoimmune diseases (ie, polyarteritis
nodosa and Behçet disease), and connective tissue disorders. Multiple aneurysms are identiﬁed in approximately
10% of cases.87,111,136,146,181-184 Atherosclerosis, when present, is thought to be a secondary process. We recommend conﬁrmation of the diagnosis of polyarteritis
nodosa in any patient with a history of fever, arthralgia,
weakness, abdominal pain, or pleuritic chest pain that
accompanies mesenteric branch aneurysm.107
Whereas patients may present with abdominal pain,
most jejunal and ileal artery aneurysms are

We suggest abdominal axial imaging to screen for concomitant intraabdominal aneurysms in patients who did not have CTA at the time of
diagnosis.
