 reﬂux has been shown to improve
symptoms and reduce the need for additional procedures, compared with ablation of the above-knee GSV
only.152-154
Evidence. Several studies showed better results of
above-knee GSV ablation when there was no residual
below-knee GSV reﬂux.152,153 In a systematic review,
Sussman et al33 found that above-knee-below-knee
EVLA was associated with signiﬁcantly lower odds of
below-knee GSV reﬂux recurrence compared with
above-knee-EVLA only (P < .0001). Theivacumar et al152
randomized 68 limbs of 65 patients with varicosities
and both above-knee and below-knee GSV reﬂux to
either EVLA above-knee, EVLA to below-knee midcalf, or
above-knee EVLA with concomitant below-knee FS.
There was improvement in the Aberdeen Varicose Vein
Severity Score at 6 weeks in all groups, although it was
greater in the latter two groups; patient satisfaction at
twelve weeks was not different between the groups.
Compared with above-knee EVLA, concomitant belowknee ablation (laser or sclerotherapy) resulted in fewer
varicosities and superior symptom relief at 6 weeks
(Table XIII).152 In another study the same authors treated
69 limbs with above-knee EVLA, 40 with C2 disease.153 At
6 weeks, residual varicosities, if present, were treated with
FS. Reﬂux in the below-knee GSV was evaluated, and the
limbs were allocated into three groups: group A, no

reﬂux; group B, ﬂash reﬂux <1 second; and group C, signiﬁcant reﬂux >1 second. Delayed FS was required in 12%
in group A, 14% in group B, and 89% in group C. The
improvement in Aberdeen Varicose Vein Severity Score
at 6 weeks was 86.2% in group A, 82.1% in group B, and
59.1%
