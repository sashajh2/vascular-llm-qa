 surgery, with a signiﬁcant
risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality. Centers
of excellence report impressively low mortality and spinal cord ischemia rates in elective cases of 4.8% and
4.6%, respectively.77 In tandem, the mortality after open
surgical treatment of ruptured TAA in highly specialized
practices has been reported to be close to 26%.78 In
contrast, the overall mortality rates in the United States
for elective, open repair of TAA is approximately 22%,79
highlighting the effect that surgeon and center experience has on overall outcomes of these patients. However,
data have consistently demonstrated that TEVAR of isolated TAA is a safe alternative to open surgery and is associated with a substantially lower morbidity and mortality
and a shorter hospitalization.80,81 Large studies designed
to evaluate the long-term (>5 years) outcomes have only
recently become available.82 Only one small series of
thoracic PAU showed a potential beneﬁt to TEVAR
because of a similar long-term survival (w50% at 10 years
in both groups), with lower morbidity in the TEVAR
group, despite being done in patients with a higher
number of preoperative comorbidities.83 In addition,
only recently has there been an attempt to establish a
risk scoring system speciﬁcally developed to predict mortality in patients undergoing TEVAR.84,85
A Cochrane review compared thoracic stent grafting to
open surgery for TAA and concluded that although stent
