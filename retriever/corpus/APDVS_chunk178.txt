Deterministic versus stochastic radiation eects
Before delving into the various risks associated with radiation exposure, it’s essential to provide
a brief overview of the types of radiation effects. These effects can be broadly categorized into
deterministic and stochastic effects.
Deterministic effects, also known as non-stochastic effects, occur when specific radiation
dose thresholds are exceeded leading to adverse outcomes. They are dose-dependent and
result in significant damage, such as cell death in a specific organ. Examples of deterministic
effects include cataracts, infertility, and non-malignant skin lesions. (Weerakkody et al. 2008a)
Making sure thresholds are not surpassed is pertinent not only for individuals working in the
endovascular suite but also for ensuring patient safety.

The table above underscores a crucial consideration: deterministic effects may potentially
arise in cases with prolonged run times. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a routine
procedure for modern vascular surgeons. While the duration of these procedures may vary,
considering the cited range of radiation dosages from 0.51 to 3.74 (Weerakkody et al. 2008a),
it’s conceivable that patients could experience post-operative adverse events solely due to the
effects of radiation exposure.
In contrast, stochastic effects result from repeated exposure to radiation levels below a certain
threshold. A notable example of stochastic effects is cancer. Stochastic effects are probabilistic
in nature. For example, the likelihood of developing leukemia after a single chest X-ray is low.
However, if someone were to undergo a head-to-toe CT scan daily for a year, the probability of
developing leukemia would significantly increase, even though there isn’t a direct correlation
between the dose of radiation and the observed effect. (Hamada and Fujimichi 2014)

The Eye and Radiation Exposure:
During radiological procedures, one organ that often goes unnoticed but is significantly exposed
is the eye, specifically the lens.
