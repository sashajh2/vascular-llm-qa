 lacunar stroke, and poor life expectancy.138 A network
meta-analysis showed no superiority for aspirin with
rivaroxaban over clopidogrel alone for the primary composite endpoint in the chronic PAD subgroups of CAPRIE
and COMPASS.139 Therefore in the absence of a RCT
directly comparing the two, both clopidogrel alone and
aspirin with rivaroxaban are reasonable choices for secondary cardiovascular prevention for patients with
chronic symptomatic PAD, but the risk of bleeding and
contraindications should be taken into account when
discussing the options with the patient.137 The ESVS
antithrombotic guidelines recommend that those not
at high risk of bleeding who undergo an endovascular
intervention for lower extremity PAD may be considered
for a one to six month course of dual antiplatelet therapy
(aspirin plus clopidogrel) to reduce the risk of MACE and
MALE followed by single antiplatelet therapy.137 Similarly,
those undergoing endovascular intervention who are not
at high risk of bleeding should be considered for aspirin
(75 e 100 mg daily) and low dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg
twice daily) to reduce the risk of MACE and MALE.137,140
If the bleeding risk is considered to be high, single antiplatelet therapy should be used post-intervention. If clopidogrel is used in addition to aspirin and low dose
rivaroxaban after endovascular intervention, clopidogrel
should only be used for < 30 days as with longer term
use the bleeding risk is likely to outweigh the
beneﬁt.137,141
The ESVS antithrombotic guidelines recommend that
those undergoing infrainguinal endarterectomy or bypass
surgery who are not at high risk of bleeding should be
considered for aspirin (75 e 100 mg daily) and low dose
rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) to reduce the risk of
MACE and MALE. Those persons undergoing infrainguinal
bypass surgery with autogenous vein who are not at high
bleeding risk may be considered for treatment with
vitamin K antagonist to improve graft patency
