The revolution in endovascular technology has transformed the evaluation and treatment of venous disease
during the past decade. To keep up with the rapidly changing technology, in this document the Venous Guideline
Committee of the SVS and the AVF provides evidencebased guidelines for the management of varicose veins and
associated CVDs in 2011. These guidelines are essential to
the clinical practice using evidence-based medicine and play
a major role— but not the only role—in determining the
best care for patients with varicose veins and more advanced
forms of CVD. The scientific evidence presented in this
document must be combined with the physician’s clinical
experience and the patient’s preference to select the best
diagnostic tests and the best treatment option for each
individual patient.
