 especially for patients
who have symptoms of SCI. Rescue protocols also exist,
which include a further increase in systemic blood pressure to >100 mm Hg, a drop in the CSF drain pressure
(often 5 mm Hg or 7 mm Hg), transfusion to a target hemoglobin level of >10 mg/dL, and the use of steroids.125
Recommendation 17: We recommend increasing
perfusion pressure through controlled hypertension
(mean arterial pressure >90 mm Hg) as a component
of a spinal cord protection protocol in patients at high
risk of SCI because of extensive coverage length
(>15 cm), poor hypogastric perfusion (occluded or significantly stenosed hypogastric arteries), or coverage of
important collaterals (subclavian/hypogastric arteries).
Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of
Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 18: We recommend prophylactic
CSF drainage for SCI protection in TEVAR cases that are
deemed high risk (covering extensive length of descending aorta; previous aortic coverage, including EVAR and

open AAA repair; compromised pelvic perfusion with
diseased or occluded common or internal iliac arteries;
diseased or occluded vertebral arteries; planned LSA
coverage; or deemed high risk by the operating surgeon).
Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of
Evidence: B (Moderate)
Management of the LSA and vertebrobasilar system
An adequate proximal landing zone requires coverage of
the LSA in 26% to 40% of patients undergoing TEVAR.109,126
In the Ô¨Årst U.S. TEVAR regulatory trial,80 all patients underwent prophylactic LSA revascularization before TEVAR if
the operative plan called for LSA coverage. Guidelines on
LSA revascularization were published in 2009 by the
SVS,127 yet there remains variability in this practice with
continued debate on the indications for revascularization.
Some surgeons perform revascularization routinely, some
selectively, and some perform LSA revascularization only
if symptoms occur after TEVAR.127,128 There are four major
concerns with coverage of the LSA
