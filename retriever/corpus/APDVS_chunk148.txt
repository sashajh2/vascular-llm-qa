Access wires:
 Short, typically 0.018” wires with a soft, non-directional tip to prevent any trauma to the
vessel when entering, and a stiffer body to allow tracking of the introducer and sheath
into the vessel.
Guidewires:
 Generally are characterized as pushable, hydrophilic wires with a foppy, curved or angled
tips that are designed to track through tortuous vessels without causing blunt trauma
to the vessel wall.
 Guidewires are also used for their directionality to cannulate branches.
 Standard Glidewire (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan): can be used as an access or
guidewire. Hydrophilic coating, straight or angled tip, sized 0.018” - 0.035” in diameter
and 150 cm or 260 cm in length.
 Bentson (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN): fexible wire with a hydrophobic coating and curved tip. Used to access vessels that have a slight curve, or to introduce
catheters or sheaths. Comes in 0.035” diameter and 150 cm or 260 cm in length.
 Rosen (Cook medical, Bloomington, IN): stiff hydrophobic wire with J tip. Often
used as the first wire exchanged for the access wire. 0.035” long and 80 cm to 260 cm in
length.
Rail wires:
 Used as a platform to support catheter and sheath exchanges, as well as to advance
devices, such as stents or endografts.
 Rail wires come in a range of stiffness, from medium to very stiff.
 They may have a straight, foppy, or curved tip.
Medium stiffness rail wires:
 Bentson (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN): fexible wire with a hydrophobic coating and curved tip. Used to access vessels that have a slight curve, or to introduce
catheters or sheaths. Comes in 0.035” diameter and 150 cm or 260 cm in length.
 Rosen (Cook medical, Bloomington, IN): stiff hydrophobic wire with J tip. Often
used as the first wire exchanged for the access wire. 0.035
