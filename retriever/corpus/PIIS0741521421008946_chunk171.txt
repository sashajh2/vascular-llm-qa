noting advantages of one surgical specialty over
another.559,566,567 Only a few studies have examined the
combined impact of the surgeon’s specialty and volume
as they relate to CEA outcomes.559,567 Healthcare reform
and related issues concerning comparative and costeffectiveness are driving the need to deﬁne outcomerelated interventions. This is especially true for asymptomatic CEA because some authorities question the
value of stroke prevention vs optimal medical therapy.
A meta-analysis of 25 studies (936,436 CEA) noted a signiﬁcant correlation between CEA in higher-volume centers and lower risk of 30-day perioperative death,
stroke, and stroke/death. The critical threshold was 79

cases per year per center.568 Similarly, a British study of
18,248 CEAs showed there was a signiﬁcant relationship
between volume and outcomes that favored higher volume centers. These were associated with a lower mortality risk and shorter length of stay.569 In this study, the
critical threshold was 35 CEA per center per year.
Enomoto et al570 reported on surgical specialty and
outcomes for CEA using data for 34,493 CEAs from
2005 to 2010 in the NSQIP database. After controlling
for patient/surgical characteristics, patients treated by
general surgeons did not have signiﬁcant differences in
length of stay or 30-day mortality than those treated by
vascular surgeons. However, general surgery patients
had nearly twice the risk of acquiring a surgical site infection (OR, 1.9; P ¼ .012) and greater than 1.5 times the risk
of stroke (OR, 1.6; P ¼ .008) than vascular surgery patients.
But general surgery patients had less than half the risk of
MI (OR, 0.34; P ¼ .031) compared with vascular surgery
patient. The authors concluded that surgical specialty
was associated with a wide range of postoperative clinical outcomes after
