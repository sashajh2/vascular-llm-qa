to thrombolytic agents.16,27 Although most contraindications can be identified on routine clinical assessment,
some68 have suggested brain imaging before thrombolysis
in patients with malignancies known to metastasize to the
central nervous system.
The associated risks of catheter-directed thrombolysis
include hemorrhage (particularly intracranial), PE, and recurrent DVT. Although complications have been poorly
reported in comparative trials, some data regarding the
bleeding complications associated with catheter-directed
thrombolytic therapy are available. Among 473 patients
reported in the multicenter National Venous Registry,
bleeding complications were reported in 54 (11%), neurologic complications in two (0.4%), PE in six (1%), and death
in two (0.4%). Bleeding complications were most common
at the venous insertion site (4%) or in the retroperitoneum
(1%). Major neurologic complications, including one fatal
intracranial hemorrhage and one subdural hematoma, occurred in only two patients (0.4%).
A systematic review that included trials of systemic and
locoregional thrombolysis reported higher rates of bleeding among patients treated with thrombolytic agents (RR,
1.73; 95% CI 1.04-2.88) but no significant differences in
mortality (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.29-2.42), pulmonary embolism (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.34-4.45), or intracranial
hemorrhage (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 0.21-13.70).20 Notably,
these authors observed that bleeding complications, which
occurred in 10% of thrombolytic patients compared with
8% of patients treated with anticoagulation, tended to
decrease over time, perhaps
