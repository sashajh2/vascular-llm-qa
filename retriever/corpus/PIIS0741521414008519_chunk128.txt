 with up to 60 mm Hg
calf and 50 mm Hg foot are associated with improvement
in calf muscle pump function compared with graduated
compression.509,510
We recommend 20 to 30 mm Hg compression with
the length (knee high or thigh high) determined by patient
preference. Compliance with compression is important for
its beneﬁcial effect yet may not always be well documented
or emphasized. Difﬁculty in application of compression
garments may play a role in noncompliance, which may increase with higher compression levels.508 Other reasons
exist for noncompliance, including transient conditions
such as pregnancy or recent venous surgery.501,511 Good
compliance produces effective results. For example, in a
large population-based study, most patients with C1-4

disease found that compression therapy signiﬁcantly
improved swelling, heaviness, and pain with overall >70%
compliance during 6-year follow-up.501 Unlike treatment
for VLU recurrence prevention, when compression is
used for prophylaxis against VLU in those at risk, there is
no evidence that high levels of compression are more effective than lesser. A meta-analysis of 11 RCTs of compression
for CVI suggested that the level of compression needed to
be at least 10 to 15 mm Hg, but higher levels were not
necessarily beneﬁcial.508 Thus, as a balance between effectiveness and compliance, the more moderate compression
level is recommended. Last, follow-up after prescription
of compression is important to address the patient’s needs
related to compression ﬁtting and may be a way to enhance
compliance. Although weak evidence exists, compression
may decrease long-term costs associated with CVI. In a
Markov decision analysis, use of compression was associated with an estimated savings of $17,000 during a patient’s lifetime.512 However, this study used a
hypothetical patient with C5 disease and did not directly
assess lower clinical classes of venous reﬂux. Regardless,
this study provides support for use of compression in those
at risk for VLU without
