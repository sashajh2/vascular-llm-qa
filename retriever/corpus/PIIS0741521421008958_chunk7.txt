(RCTs).5 For uncontrolled studies, we used an adaptation
of the Newcastle Ottawa scale.6 Any discrepancy between a pair of reviewers was solved by consensus or by a
third reviewer. We rated the certainty of evidence using
the GRADE approach7 as adapted by the SVS.8,9 We
considered an estimate to be imprecise if its conﬁdence
interval (CI) overlapped both, beneﬁts and harms.10
Statistical analysis. For comparative studies, we calculated the relative risk (RR) from each study and estimated the 95% CI and pooled across studies using the
DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. For noncomparative studies, an overall event rate was calculated
and transformed using the Freeman-Tukey arcsine
method, and pooled using the DerSimonian and Laird
random effects model. The random effects model was
chosen a priori because of anticipated heterogeneity
across study populations and settings. Heterogeneity
was evaluated using the I2 index and Cochrane Q test. All
statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.1
(The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria).

RESULTS
Study selection
We reviewed 5935 citations and 898 systematic reviews.
The study selection process for the ﬁve questions is
depicted in the Supplementary Figure (online only). We
ﬁnally included 96 studies (question one, 6 studies11-16;
question two, 9 RCTs17-25; question three, 8 studies26-33;
question four, 47 studies34-80; and question ﬁve, 26
studies81-106). A detailed description of the included
study characteristics for each of the questions and their
risk of bias is available in Supplementary Tables II and
III, (online only) respectively.
Question 1: Medical management vs CEA in asymptomatic patients
We included four RCTs and two observational studies.
Most of the studies had a low risk of bias based on each
corresponding bias assessment tool. One RCT13 had a
moderate risk of bias owing to lack of blinding of outcome
assessors. The studies reported on 5498 patients (mean
