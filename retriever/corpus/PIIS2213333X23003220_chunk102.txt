AE, Adverse event; DVT, deep vein thrombosis; EVLA, endovenous laser ablation; GSV, great saphenous vein; PE, pulmonary embolism; PEM, polidocanol endovenous microfoam; RCT, randomized controlled trial; VCSS, Venous Clinical Severity Score; VV, varicose veins.

7.1.2 For patients with symptomatic telangiectasias
or reticular veins we suggest transcutaneous laser
treatment if the patient has sclerosant allergy, needle
phobia, sclerotherapy failure or small veins (<1 mm)
with telangiectatic matting.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence B (moderate)
Rationale and evidence. Surface lasers used to treat
telangiectasias have wavelength between 532 nm and
1064 nm.187 The Nd:YAG 1064 nm laser has shown results close to sclerotherapy but more pain was reported
after laser treatment.188 Parlar et al188 recommended
laser for those who have needle phobia, allergy to sclerosants and for small veins with telangiectatic matting,
while sclerotherapy is more effective for larger, feeder
veins. A 2021 Cochrane review186 found no clear difference in resolution or improvement of telangiectasias or
matting when laser was compared with sclerotherapy.
There was maybe less hyperpigmentation (RR, 0.57; 95%
