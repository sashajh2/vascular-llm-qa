id Artery Endarterectomy (CEA)
This procedure has been performed since the 1950s, either by plaque endarterectomy and
patch angioplasty or primary arterial repair. To prevent arterial restenosis, patch angioplasty
has become the standard of arterial closure after plaque removal. The procedure can involve
cerebral monitoring including electroencephalography (EEG), transcranial Doppler (TCD) and
stump pressure monitoring or be performed awake to directly monitor patient motor response.
Endarterectomy and patch repair can be performed under a “clamp and sew” mentality or with
an arterial shunt to maintain cerebral perfusion. Risks include cardiopulmonary risk of acute
myocardial ischemia, <3% perioperative risk of neurologic event, neck hematoma or cranial
nerve injury of roughly 5-10% affecting the vagus, marginal mandibular, recurrent laryngeal
or hypoglossal nerves.

Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS)
Transfemoral Carotid Artery Stenting (TFCAS) with Embolic Protection
Transfemoral stenting requires some type of protection from embolization including a distal internal carotid artery retrievable filter or fow arrest procedure to prevent cerebral embolization
during stent placement with or without angioplasty.
Transcarotid Artery Revascularization (TCAR)
Treatment of a carotid stenosis that avoids aortic arch manipulation involving direct common
carotid artery exposure and sheath placement to allow for transcarotid stent delivery to the
internal carotid artery. The common carotid artery sheath is connected to a femoral vein
sheath so that the natural arterial pressure gradient reverses fow across the distal internal
carotid artery driving blood and possible embolus into the arterial tubing circuit and across a
filter before it reenters the venous circulation. As FDA approval for the device was delivered
in 2016, the technology is less than 10 years old without robust long-term follow up data.
This technique offers a lower perioperative stroke risk than transfemoral stenting, for multiple
reasons including lack of transaortic arch manipulation and great vessel cannulation which can
result in embolus prior to placement of an
