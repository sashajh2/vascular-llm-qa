1), mean length of stay (6.3 days vs 14.0 days;
P < .0001), and lower cost of hospitalization ($21,686 vs
$42,974; P < .0001) and these differences persisted after
adjustment for clinical and hospital factors. Based on
these ﬁndings, the authors concluded that endovascular
revascularization should be the ﬁrst line of therapy for
patients with CMI. Lima et al117 performed a similar analysis using the same database from the years 2007 to 2014
to examine the impact of the choice of revascularization
on major cardiac and cerebrovascular events. In their
propensity-matched cohort, they reported that the major cardiac and cerebrovascular events and composite
in-hospital complications occurred less often after endovascular revascularization (8.6% vs 15.9% [P < .001] and
15.3% vs 20.3% [P < .0006], respectively) and that the
endovascular approach was associated with a shorter
hospital length of stay and lower hospital costs.
The aggregate evidence from the meta-analyses, case
series, and nationwide experience seems to support an
endovascular-ﬁrst approach for patients with CMI. The
consistent themes suggest that the endovascular
approach is associated with fewer perioperative

complications, shorter length of hospital stay, and lower
hospital costs, although the rates of recurrent symptoms
and reinterventions are higher. The longer term survival
rates are comparable between the open and endovascular approaches, although there seems to be trend toward
a higher perioperative mortality in the open cohort. The
comparable longer term survival seems to suggest that
endovascular failures and higher rates of recurrent symptoms are not leading an increased rate of death from
AMI. Fortunately, the endovascular-ﬁrst approach does
not seem to preclude subsequent open revascularization. In addition, the endovascular-ﬁrst recommendation
is consistent with other practice guidelines from the European Society of Vascular Surgery,11 the American College of Radiology,118 and the Society of Interventional
Radiologists.119
