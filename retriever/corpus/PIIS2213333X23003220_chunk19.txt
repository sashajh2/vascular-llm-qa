Consensus statements
11.4.1.

For patients with asymptomatic ARTE III and IV after endovenous ablation, anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant
(over a vitamin K antagonist) should be performed.

11.4.2.

For patients who receive anticoagulation for ARTE following endovenous ablation, treatment should be continued until the
thrombus retracts.
12. Management of superﬁcial vein thrombosis (SVT)

Guideline 12. addresses the management of SVT in patients who have not recently undergone superﬁcial venous interventions. The
management of ARTE and other thrombotic complications of superﬁcial venous interventions are addressed in Guideline 11.

Grade of
recommendation

For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks and tributaries above the knee >3 cm 1 (strong)
from the SFJ and >5 cm in length, whether associated with varicose veins or not, we
recommend fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneously daily for 45 days. Alternatively,
rivaroxaban 10 mg/d for 45 days may
