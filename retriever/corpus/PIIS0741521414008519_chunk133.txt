 a patient’s D-dimer
level remains elevated, venous thromboembolism recurrence risk is signiﬁcantly elevated (w2.5-fold), and continuation or reinstitution of anticoagulation is recommended,
usually for life.537 If the D-dimer level is normal, cessation
of anticoagulation is usually safe. Second, use of duplex ultrasonography for detection of residual vein wall thickening
or obstruction (scar tissue, or “residual thrombus”) may be
beneﬁcial, although the evidence is more variable in the
literature, varying from 2.5- to 9.7-fold increased
risk.538,539 If a patient has an extensively irregular or
occluded long segment of vein, this may be a marker for
increased risk of recurrent DVT, and thus continued anticoagulation may be beneﬁcial.
Last, the use of catheter-directed thrombolysis
compared with best medical therapy may signiﬁcantly
decrease PTS. The recent CaVenT trial compared best
medical therapy with adjunctive catheter-directed thrombolysis in an RCT of patients with iliofemoral DVT.540
In 209 patients, the absolute risk reduction at 24 months
was 14.4% (0.2%-28%) in PTS reduction, as assessed by Villalta score. However, several occurrences of major bleeding
did occur, offsetting some of the beneﬁt. In properly
selected patients, the beneﬁt of catheter-directed thrombolysis outweighs the risks, particularly with modern catheter thrombus removal techniques and experienced
practitioners.541
Guideline 8.4: Primary PreventiondEducation
Measures
In patients with C1-4 disease, we suggest patient
and family education, regular exercise, leg elevation
when at rest, careful skin care, weight control, and
appropriately ﬁtting foot wear. [BEST PRACTICE]

JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY
August Supplement 2014

In patients with C3 and C4 disease of primary valvular
reﬂux or C1-C4 disease related to DVT, we recommend
regular ambulation or equivalent exercise, leg elevation
when in bed or recumbent,
