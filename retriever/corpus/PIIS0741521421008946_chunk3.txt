 on an arbitrary
symptom duration of less than 24 hours.14 At that time,
TIA were deﬁned as sudden, focal neurologic deﬁcits of
vascular origin, but if the neurologic deﬁcit remained for
more than 7 days then it was a stroke. Events between
24 hours and 7 days were classiﬁed as reversible ischemic
neurologic deﬁcits. This term is no longer used because
most events lasting more than 24 hours are associated
with cerebral infarction and should therefore carry a
stroke diagnosis.
Advances in cerebral imaging yielded evidence that the
arbitrary 24-hour time period for diagnosing a TIA was
inaccurate, with up to 50% of patients showing brain
injury on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The Stroke Council of the AHA/American Stroke
Association removed time as a deﬁnitional factor and
endorsed the current TIA deﬁnition in 2009: “A transient
episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal cerebral, spinal cord or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction.” This deﬁnition includes radiologic exclusion of
stroke.15 Stroke is subsequently deﬁned as any episode
of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal cerebral, spinal,
or retinal infarction. Moving toward this radiologic
demonstration of infarction or hemorrhage, the 2013
AHA/American Stroke Association deﬁnition of stroke
included the silent infarctions. It deﬁned them based on
imaging or neuropathological evidence of central nervous
system infarction, without a history of acute neurologic
dysfunction attributable to the lesion.16 This “tissue-based”
deﬁnition represents a step forward in the characterization of cerebrovascular events. However, in everyday

practice and across different hospital settings, tissuebased diagnosis of a TIA episode may vary depending on
the availability and type of brain MRI machines.
The US tissue-based imaging deﬁnition of TIA and the
silent pathology equivalence to stroke as described elsewhere in this article are at odds with time-based clinical
deﬁnitions endorsed by the World Health Organization,
European Stroke Organization, European Society for
Vascular Surgery, and the World Stroke Organisation.10,
