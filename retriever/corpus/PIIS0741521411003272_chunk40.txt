 measurements are sensitive to
the beneficial effects of treatment. Different diseasespecific, patient-generated QOL tools and patient-reported
outcomes (PROs) have been popular in venous disease
reporting.107,108 The most frequently used validated venous diseaseâ€“specific instruments include the Venous Insufficiency Epidemiologic and Economic Study of Qualityof-Life (VEINES-QOL/Sym) questionnaire scale, the
Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIVIQ), the
Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), and
the Charing Cross Venous Ulceration Questionnaire
(CXVUQ).2,109-113
The VEINES instrument consists of 35 items in two
categories that generate two summary scores.109 The
VEINES-QOL questionnaire comprises 25 items that
study the effect of disease on QOL, and the VEINES
symptom questionnaire (VEINES-Sym) has 10 items that
measure symptoms. The focus of VEINES is on physical
symptoms rather than psychologic and social aspects.
The CIVIQ 2 is a revision of an instrument developed
to measure physical, psychologic, social, and pain factors.113 The revised version gives equal weight to each
category, with 20 questions that provide a global score.3
CIVIQ has been used in studies3,4 and proved to be a valid
QOL measurement.
The AVVQ is a 13-question survey addressing all elements of varicose vein disease. Physical symptoms and
social issues, including pain, ankle edema, ulcers, compression therapy use, and effect on daily activities, are examined
in addition to cosmesis issues. The questionnaire is scored
from 0 (no effect from varicose veins) to 100 (severe
effect).114,115
The CXVUQ was developed to provide a QOL measure for patients with venous ulcers. It provides a consistent
measure of patient-reported QOL in venous ulcers regardless of the treatment selected. Combining it with a generic
measurement instrument may provide valuable information
on the progression of ulcers and on the available treatment
measures.3
