We suggest not administering statins, doxycycline, roxithromycin, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor
blockers for the sole purpose of reducing the risk of
AAA expansion and rupture.

We suggest not administering beta blocker therapy for
the sole purpose of reducing the risk of AAA expansion
and rupture.

Timing for intervention. We recommend immediate
repair for patients who present with a ruptured aneurysm.

Should repair of a symptomatic AAA be delayed to
optimize coexisting medical conditions, we recommend
that the patient be monitored in an intensive care unit
(ICU) setting with blood products available.

Assessment of operative risk and life expectancy. We
suggest informing patients contemplating open repair
or EVAR of their Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) perioperative mortality risk score.

EVAR. We recommend preservation of ï¬‚ow to at least
one internal iliac artery.

A (High)

We recommend using Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved branch endograft devices in anatomically suitable patients to maintain perfusion to at least
one internal iliac artery.

We recommend staging bilateral internal iliac artery occlusion by at least 1 to 2 weeks if required for EVAR.

We suggest renal artery or superior mesenteric artery
(SMA) angioplasty and stenting for selected patients
with symptomatic disease before EVAR or OSR.
Level of recommendation

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

We suggest prophylactic treatment of an asymptomatic, high-grade stenosis of the SMA in the presence of
a meandering mesenteric artery based off of a large inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), which will
