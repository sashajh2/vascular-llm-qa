al7 found an early saphenous occlusion rate of 88% to 100%,
and a review of 13 studies showed evidence of short-term
benefits.
EVLA of the SSV has been described by several
groups.266-268 Proebstle et al260 observed a 100% occlusion rate at 6 months by using a 940-nm diode laser to treat
the SSV in 41 patients. In a prospective cohort study,
Huisman et al267 treated the SSV in 169 limbs with an
810-nm diode laser. The treated length averaged 23 cm
(range, 6-53 cm). Occlusion of the SSV after 3 months was
achieved in 98%.
Knipp et al268 reported a 1-year saphenous occlusion
rate of 95.9% in 460 limbs treated with 810-nm EVLA and
observed sustained improvement using the VCSS. These
authors also found that outcomes were not affected by the
presence or absence of deep vein insufficiency.
Complications. In an international endovascular
working group registry that included 3696 procedures,
bruising after EVLA was observed in 75%, paresthesia in
3%, thrombophlebitis in 1.87%, skin burns in 0.46%, and
DVT or endovenous heatâ€“induced thrombosis in
0.27%.263 Only one patient had a PE. In 509 patients
treated with laser by Myers and Jolley,264 thromboembolic
complications occurred in 3%. Knipp et al268 observed a
DVT rate of 2.2% in patients who underwent EVLA with
phlebectomy or perforator ligation and a thrombus extension rate into the femoral veins of 5.9%. When EVLA alone
was performed, there was 0% true DVT but a high thrombus extension rate (7.
