 suggest endovascular techniques for the elective repair of anatomically appropriate
RAAs to include stent graft exclusion of main RAAs in patients with poor operative
risk and embolization of distal and parenchymal aneurysms.

We suggest consideration of laparoscopic and robotic techniques as an interventional
alternative based on institutional resources and surgeon experience with minimally
invasive techniques.

when >30 to 40 minutes of warm renal ischemia is
anticipated to reduce the risk of acute tubular necrosis,
there are no prospective or randomized data to support this practice.37,49,50,60
Although historically treated with nephrectomy, current data support that complex distal branch lesions
are best approached with ex vivo repair and autotransplantation. The largest series of such follow.
Murray et al61 have described a 92% success rate with
in situ bifurcation and ex vivo multibranch replacement with branched and unbranched internal iliac artery autograft in 12 patients without mortality or major
morbidity. Gallagher et al62 reported on seven ex vivo
reconstructions after laparoscopic nephrectomy for
complex aneurysmal disease to avoid incisional
morbidity; these authors described excellent technical
success, no mortality, no ureteral morbidity, and 28%
incidence of perioperative morbidity. Chandra et al38
compared in situ and ex vivo reconstructions for renal
aneurysm across 10 patients and noted no signiﬁcant
difference in hospital length of stay, morbidity (20%),
mortality (null), or need for reoperation at follow-up.
In addition, 100% of reconstructions were patent by
imaging obtained during the ﬁrst year of follow-up.
Case reports and small series that suggest indications
for endovascular repair have broadened with the introduction of three-dimensional detachable coils, nonadhesive liquid embolic agents (eg, Onyx [Medtronic,
Irvine, Calif]), remodeling techniques (which include
balloon- and stent
