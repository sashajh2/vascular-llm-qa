ability

What is the overall certainty of the
evidence of effects?

Moderate certainty for venous intervention vs
compression stockings; low certainty for
head-to-head comparisons

Moderate

How large are the resource requirements
associated with the intervention?

The type of insurance will often drive costs and
out-of-pocket expenses; out-of-pocket
procedural costs have varied widely

Unknown

How large is the incremental cost relative
to the net beneÔ¨Åt?

One study from the United Kingdom showed
that endovenous therapies were most cost
effective, followed by UGFS, HL&S, and
conservative therapy

Unknown

What would be the effect on health
inequities?

For patients without access, or for whom the
cost of endovenous therapy is prohibitive,
HL&S is an acceptable strategy

Unknown

Is the option acceptable to key
stakeholders?

All studies showed either strategy is
acceptable compared with no therapy;
individuals who place high priority on longterm outcomes would likely not choose
UGFS

Probably yes

Is the option feasible to implement?

Yes, it is a widely adopted technology; HL&S
can be used if technology or expertise for
endovenous ablation is not available or
venous anatomy precludes endovenous
treatment

Probably yes

RFA, Radiofrequency ablation; QoL, quality of life; UGFS, ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy.

Judgment

How substantial are desirable anticipated
effects of the strategy?

No clear difference present in terms of outcomes
between thermal and nonthermal vein ablation
because the data are indeterminate and the
nonthermal group is heterogeneous

Unknown

How substantial are the undesirable
anticipated effects?

Unclear difference in outcomes; thermal
interventions could be associated with lower
generic QoL scores and an increased risk of adverse
events compared with CAC or n-butyl
cyanoacrylate, but the evidence is uncertain

Small

Do the desirable effects outweigh the
undesirable effects?

Probably no
