Morrison et al202 showed that bubbles were detected in
the right heart in all patients after room air FS and highintensity transient signals were seen in the middle cerebral artery in 4 of 21 patients. Morrison et al203 looked at
side effects using air and CO2 foam for endovenous
chemical ablation and found visual disturbances (VDs)
were experienced by 3.1% (4/128) and 8.2% (4/49) patients
in the CO2 and room air groups respectively (P ¼ .15). Respiratory difﬁculties or circumoral paresthesia each
occurred in 0.8% (n ¼ 1) of the CO2 patients. Incidence
of chest tightness (3.1% vs 18%), dry cough (1.6% vs 16%),
or dizziness (3.1% vs 12%) were signiﬁcantly lower in the
CO2 vs room air group (P < .02). While other
