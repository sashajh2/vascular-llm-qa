Skin complications. EVLA was associated with an
increased risk of ecchymosis than CAC (RR, 2.17; 95% CI,
1.39-3.37; 1 study76).
Outcomes at 1 year.
Anatomic closure. EVLA was associated with higher
anatomic closure rates than UGFS (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.111.37; I2 ¼0.00%; 3 studies82,94,100).
Quality of life. RFA was associated with worse generic
QoL scores when compared with CAC (SMD, e19.02;
95% CI, e20.82 to e17.22; 1 study86).
Recurrent incompetence. RFA intervention was associated with an increased risk of recurrent incompetence
than CAC (RR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.07-9.64; I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2
studies86,97). Compared with UGFS, EVLA, and RFA were
associated with lower risk of recurrent incompetence
(RR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.05-0.59; 1 1study105) and (RR, 0.06; 95%
CI, 0.01-0.44; 1 study,105 respectively).
Reintervention. Compared with UGFS, EVLA and RFA
were associated with a lower risks of reintervention (RR,
0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.91; I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies100,105) and
(RR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.02-0.98; 1 study105), respectively.
Outcomes at 5 years.
Anatomic closure. EVLA was associated with a higher
rate of anatomic closure than foam UGFS (RR,
