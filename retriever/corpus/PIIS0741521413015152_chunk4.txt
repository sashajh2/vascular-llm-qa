ASC),9 and the European Consensus10 statements proposing similar deﬁnitions for CLI based on the
presence or absence of tissue necrosis, with the addition of
toe pressure (TP) and transcutaneous oxygen measurements
(TcPO2). AP criteria range from <40 to 70 mm Hg with TP
and TcPO2 <30 to 50 mm Hg; lower values are required for
patients with rest pain, and higher ones for patients presenting with tissue loss (ulceration or gangrene).
CLI implies a poor limb outcome without intervention.
Observations from the Circulase trial11 raise serious doubts
about this very concept. Only patients with rest pain (Fontaine III) and ischemic ulcers or gangrene (Fontaine IV)
who met strict hemodynamic criteria were enrolled. In the
placebo arm of this trial, the amputation rate at 6 months
was only 13%, nearly all of which were judged to result
from complications of ischemia, “with untreatable infection
the most common indication.”11 Marston reported a series
of 142 patients with wounds and severe limb ischemia
(ankle-brachial index [ABI] <0.7 or TP <50 mm Hg)
who were treated at a comprehensive wound care center
with meticulous wound care but without revascularization.12 The amputation rates were 19% at 6 months and
23% at 12 months. Wound healing with conservative
management was reported in 52% of patients at 12 months.
A recent study by Elgzyri and colleagues evaluated 602
patients with diabetic foot ulcers who had either a systolic
TP <45 mm Hg or an AP <80 mm Hg who were not revascularized and reported that 50% healed primarily with
wound care or with minor amputation; 17% healed, but

only after requiring a major amputation; and 33% died
with limbs intact but with unhealed wounds. The authors
concluded by stating that “diabetic patients with ischemic
foot ulcers not available for revascularization are not
excluded from healing without major amputation.Our
