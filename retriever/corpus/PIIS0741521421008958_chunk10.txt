 between
the degree of asymptomatic carotid stenosis and ipsilateral stroke in patients treated with contemporary
best medical therapy. The ipsilateral stroke rate was
signiﬁcantly greater for patients with 80% to 99% carotid stenosis than those with 50% to less than 80%
stenosis (18% vs 1%; P < .0001). Patients with 70% to
99% carotid stenosis had a higher risk of ipsilateral
stroke than those with 50% to less than 70% stenosis
(P < .0001). These studies suggest that the beneﬁt of
CEA might be underestimated in patients with severe
stenosis (>70%).107
Question 2: CEA vs CAS in symptomatic low risk surgical
patients
We included nine RCTs (published in 25 different publications). Four RCTs had a low overall risk of bias, three
had a moderate risk of bias mainly owing to lack of blinding of outcome assessors, and two had a high risk of bias
owing to a lack of blinding of outcome assessors, and
inadequate random sequence generation, allocation
concealment and possible selective reporting. The
studies reported on 5486 patients (mean age, 69 years;
75% males). The most common comorbidities in this
group of patients are hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and
coronary artery disease.
Outcomes at 30 days. CEA was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in stroke and a signiﬁcant increase in
the risk of MI at 30 days compared with CAS (7 studies;
RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.42-0.86; Fig 1) and (6 studies; RR,
2.15; 95% CI, 1.27-3.61; Fig 2), respectively. Certainty in evidence was high.
Estimates were highly imprecise to derive conclusions
about the outcomes of death, ipsilateral stroke and
death/stroke at 30 days (8 studies; RR, 0.63; 95% CI,
0.3
