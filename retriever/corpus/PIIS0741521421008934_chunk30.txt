1: For patients with a recent stable stroke (modiﬁed
Rankin scale score, 0-2), we recommend carotid revascularization for symptomatic patients with >50% stenosis to be performed as soon as the patient is
neurologically stable after 48 hours but deﬁnitely
before 14 days after the onset of symptoms (grade IB).
3.2: For patients undergoing revascularization within
the ﬁrst 14 days after the onset of symptoms, we
recommend CEA rather than CAS (grade IB).
3.3: We recommend against revascularization,
regardless of the extent of stenosis, for patients who
have experienced a disabling stroke, have a modiﬁed
Rankin scale score of $3, whose area of infarction is
>30% of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery territory, or who have altered consciousness to minimize
the risk of postoperative parenchymal hemorrhage.
These patients can be reevaluated for revascularization later if their neurologic recovery is satisfactory
(grade IC).

Evidence and rationale
No consensus has been reached on which patient populations should undergo carotid screening for the detection of asymptomatic carotid disease, and no direct
evidence is available on the beneﬁts of screening
regarding the actual outcomes of future stroke. The
rationale behind screening for asymptomatic disease
has been determined by the assumptions that unheralded stroke is often the ﬁrst symptom of signiﬁcant carotid atherosclerosis and that the medical, surgical, or
endovascular treatment of identiﬁed severe carotid artery stenosis can prevent future cerebral infarction. The
