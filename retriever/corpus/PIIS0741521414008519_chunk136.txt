vidence that prophylactic repair of the deep venous
valvular system can decrease long-term VLUs in those patients who have not manifested any such entity.
The goal of surgical treatments should be to improve
the patient’s symptoms, including leg pain, swelling, and
discomfort. To achieve this goal, numerous interventions
exist for treatment of superﬁcial venous disease as well as
deep system disease for secondary prevention of VLU,
speciﬁed in the section on operative/endovascular management and in other guidelines for comprehensive management of superﬁcial venous disease.23
FUTURE DIRECTIONS/CONCLUSIONS
The SVS/AVF Evidence-Based Clinical Practice
Guidelines for Management of Venous Leg Ulcers is the
end result of a programmatic initiative by the AVF “to
reduce the incidence of venous ulcer 50% over the next
decade”29 combined with the need for clinical practice
guidelines for VLUs, as recognized by the SVS Document
Oversight Committee. With the primary target audience
for these guidelines, specialists who treat VLUs, the current
guidelines attempt to update as well as to address gaps in
prior VLU guidelines. A recent systematic analysis of existing VLU guidelines demonstrated concordance in certain
areas but signiﬁcant management gaps in others, such as
advanced wound therapies, role of thermal ablation of superﬁcial venous disease, valve reconstruction, and treatment of outﬂow obstruction by stenting, all of which
were not addressed in previous guideline documents.18 Toward that end, formal new systematic review and metaanalyses were performed for two areas, compression and
surgical/endovascular treatments.30,31
The current SVS/AVF clinical practice guidelines are
based on the best level of evidence currently available for
a recommendation. The strength of a recommendation
for a speciﬁc guideline is tempered by the quality of evidence supporting that recommendation. The SVS/AVF
Joint Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee has reviewed
the grading of recommendations within each subcommittee and as an overall group with an eye toward a
critical assessment. Overall, the evidence level for venous
ulcer management is mostly of moderate strength, and as
a consequence, most recommendations as a whole achieve
lower grades, Grade 2B (18.6%) and Grade 2C
