ectomy and thrombolytic strategies, it has become clear that compressive or
obstructive iliac vein lesions contribute to many cases of
iliofemoral DVT. A pooled analysis of 19 published studies,
including 1046 patients treated with catheter-directed or
pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, reported the use of
stents in 46% of patients.27 Although the total number of
limbs with stenoses or obstructive lesions uncovered by
lytic therapy in the National Venous Registry was not
reported, 33% of limbs required treatment with metallic
stents.16 The 1-year patency was significantly better in
limbs treated with iliac stents (74%) than in limbs without
stent placement (53%; P ‚¨ç .001).
Although lacking evidence from comparative trials, the
relatively poor results associated with untreated iliac stenosis and the poor results achieved with angioplasty favor
stenting of any persistent obstructive lesions uncovered by
thrombolysis and is strongly recommended (Grade 1C).
Single-plane venography may be relatively insensitive in the
detection of iliocaval compression. Compared with intravascular ultrasound, venography has been demonstrated to
have a sensitivity of only 45% for the detection of chronic
iliac obstruction.91 Although likely a useful adjunct in this
setting, there are currently little data regarding the use of

4.1. We recommend against routine use of inferior
vena cava filters (permanent or temporary) in conjunction with catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis of the iliofemoral venous segments (Grade 1C). Although catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis may
be associated with asymptomatic radiographic evidence of
PE,85 symptomatic PE appears to be a relatively rare complication of catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis.
Among the 473 patients included in the National Venous
Registry,16 in whom IVC filters were not routinely used,
PE occurred in only 1% of patients. Notably, 71% of procedures involved thrombus extension to at least the iliofemoral
segments, and 15% had extension to the IVC. The mean
incidence of PE was 0.9% in a pooled analysis of 1
