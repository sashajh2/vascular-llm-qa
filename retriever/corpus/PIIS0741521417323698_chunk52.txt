We recommend restarting metformin no sooner than 48
hours after administration of contrast material as long as
renal function has remained stable (<25% increase in
creatinine concentration above baseline).

Hematologic disorders. The presence of an aortic
aneurysm inï¬‚uences both platelet count and function.
Low platelet counts and high glycocalicin levels have
been observed in patients with an AAA, which has
been attributed to increased platelet destruction within
the aneurysm sac.151 Whereas a threshold of platelet
count below which elective AAA repair should be deferred has not been addressed, further evaluation is
warranted if the platelet count is <150,000 platelets/mL.
After elective OSR, a platelet count of <130,000/mL is
associated with an increased risk of bleeding.152 Platelet
sequestration and thrombocytopenia may occur after
OSR, which may persist for several weeks, especially
when proximal clamping necessitates periods of renal or
visceral ischemia.153 Matsumura and colleagues suggested that a lower preoperative platelet count is an independent predictor of 2-year mortality among patients
undergoing both EVAR and OSR.154
Elevated levels of homocysteine, plasminogen activator
inhibitor 1, and lipoprotein(a) have been observed among
patients with aortic aneurysms, but their role in
