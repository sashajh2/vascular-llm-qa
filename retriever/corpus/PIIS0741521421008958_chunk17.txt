0.22-1.18; Supplementary Table I, online only).
Carotid artery stenting.
Combined coronary artery bypass grafting and CAS
vs CAS ﬁrst. Estimates were highly imprecise to derive
conclusions about the outcome of death (2 studies; RR,
4.62; 95% CI, 0.72-29.87; Supplementary Table I, online
only). Other outcomes are presented in Supplementary
Table I, online only.
Asymptomatic carotid disease. We evaluated in sensitivity analyses cohorts of asymptomatic carotid stenosis.
The majority of patients included in this analysis had
combined CEA and coronary artery bypass grafting
(CABG) compared with CEA ﬁrst. The combined
approach compared with the carotid intervention ﬁrst
was associated with a signiﬁcant increase in stroke (4
studies; RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.16-1.73; Supplementary Table I,
online only) and in death/stroke (2 studies; RR, 1.28; 95%
CI, 1.10-1.49; Supplementary Table I, online only). There
was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in death (4
studies; RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.23-10.31; Supplementary
Table I, online only). Supplementary Table I, (online
only) outlines the outcomes for comparing a combined
approach in this subgroup to the patients in whom
CABG was done ﬁrst. The exclusion of mixed series (in
which the carotid intervention was CAS or CEA) provides
the same conclusions.
Symptomatic carotid disease. We evaluated in sensitivity analyses cohorts of symptomatic carotid stenosis
in which patients were treated with a combined CEA

and CABG approach vs CABG ﬁrst (ie, no CAS studies). Estimates were highly imprecise to derive conclusions
about all outcomes. The results are summarized in the
Supplementary Table I, (online only). Cert
