signiﬁcant difference in anatomic closure of the treated
GSV at 1 month or 1 year.
No studies exclusively evaluated patients with simple
varicose veins (CEAP class C2) only, although the majority

of patients in the three studies were C2 patients. Data on
perforator ablation alone without saphenous ablation in
C2 patients were not available.
Saphenous ablation without or with concomitant
treatment with phlebectomy or sclerotherapy. We
included one RCT (in 2 publications),114,115 two observational studies,116,117 and one systematic review118 (8 studies
including Carradice et al114) to examine the effect of
concomitant treatment with phlebectomy or sclerotherapy vs no concomitant treatment. The total number of
patients was 6098, and the majority were women.
Short-term results conﬁrmed that concomitant phlebectomy prolonged the procedure but decreased the
need for secondary procedures and signiﬁcantly
improved QoL.114 Five-year results of the same RCT
showed excellent and similar clinical results and QoL
scores in both groups, but concomitant treatment was
associated with optimal improvement in both QoL and
the severity of clinical disease.115
When combined therapy, which included EVLT or RFA
with phlebectomy or sclerotherapy, was compared
with ablation only (unimodal therapy, with RFA or laser),
multivariate analysis revealed signiﬁcant reduction of the
Venous Clinical Severity Score scores on the combined
therapy vs the unimodal therapy groups (P ¼ .002).116
Brown et al117 analyzed outcomes in 3375 patients
enrolled into the Vascular Quality Initiative Varicose
Vein registry, with symptomatic C2 disease, who underwent saphenous ablation with RFA or EVLT; 59.9%
also had concomitant phlebectomies. An improvement in overall symptoms at more than 3 months
follow-up was experienced by 94.4% of patients with
more signiﬁcant decreases among patients undergoing ablation and phleb
