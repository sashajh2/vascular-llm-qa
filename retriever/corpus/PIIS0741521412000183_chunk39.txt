3) should be strongly encouraged over technical outcomes such as lytic success and surrogate
markers such as reflux and residual venous obstruction.
Randomized clinical trials, including the ATTRACT104
(Acute Venous Thrombosis: Thrombus Removal with
Adjunctive Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis) and
CaVenT50,105 (Catheter-directed Venous Thrombolysis
in Acute Iliofemoral Vein Thrombosis) trials, are currently underway and will likely provide further evidence
regarding the clinical utility of these strategies. We anticipate that the results of these trials will lead to guideline revisions.
The currently available evidence cannot address several
important questions. These include the optimal thrombolytic dose, the relative safety and efficacy of different thrombolytic agents and mechanical thrombectomy devices, and
the appropriate intensity of anticoagulation to be used
during thrombolytic procedures. Also, too little data are
available to guide recommendations regarding the use of
adjuvants such as intermittent pneumatic compression.106,107 Finally, the quality-of-life benefits and costeffectiveness of this therapy need to be more thoroughly
evaluated.
