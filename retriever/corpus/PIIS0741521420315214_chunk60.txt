 and pre-emptively
treated SMA stenosis or cases in which partial SMA
coverage occurred during TEVAR (39% of cases) with
balloon-expandable stents. They documented one case
of lethal hepatic ischemia (despite subsequent open
bypass), one case of acalculous cholecystitis, and one
case of sigmoid colon ischemia thought to be embolic.173
Another study evaluated 18 TEVAR cases using only angiography (no balloon occlusion) before CA coverage. Two
patients had documented mesenteric ischemia after CA
coverage. One patient had self-limited abdominal pain
and two others had elevated white blood cell counts,
also self-limited. No elevation in the liver or pancreatic enzymes occurred after TEVAR.174,175 In another series, CA
coverage led to a delayed presentation of iatrogenic
chronic mesenteric ischemia despite only “encroaching”
on the CA and a widely patent SMA.176
If the seal zone includes the CA oriﬁce, an appropriately
sized endograft alone should occlude the origin of the
CA, obviating the need for embolization. If it is absolutely
needed, CA embolization should be done carefully and

sparingly to avoid inadvertent extension of the embolic
material into the common CA trunk and risking foregut
ischemia. In cases of TEVAR covering the CA, vigilant
postoperative clinical examination and serial laboratory
studies should follow the early post-TEVAR period to
detect and to address foregut and hepatic ischemia
as early as possible to avoid morbid and lethal
complications.
Practice Statement: Although there are few highquality data, we suggest dedicated SMA angiography
through the SMA or CA with adequate imaging of the
entire SMA and CA mesenteric collateral system to precede TEVAR with intended or high risk for CA coverage.
(Ungraded good policy statement)
Recommendation 28: We recommend pre-emptive
SMA stenting with a balloon-expandable stent in cases
of >50% stenosis of the SMA in the following conditions:
before or after CA coverage or encroachment,
