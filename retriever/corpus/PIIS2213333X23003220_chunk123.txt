associated with signiﬁcantly lower odds of below-knee
reﬂux recurrence compared with above-knee-EVLA
alone (OR, 0.1857; 95% CI, 0.076-0.4734; P < .0001). No
statistically signiﬁcant difference was observed in belowknee-GSV reﬂux recurrence between patients receiving
above-knee-EVLA and those receiving above-knee-HL&S.
Endovenous treatment of below-knee reﬂuxing segments of GSV was investigated in a 2018 retrospective
study of 37 limbs using RFA and EVLA.216 Complete closures were found in 35/37 limbs and VCSS was reduced
in both groups. Ecchymosis scores were signiﬁcantly
lower after R
