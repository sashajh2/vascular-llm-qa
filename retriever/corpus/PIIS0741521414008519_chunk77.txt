ous leg ulcer colonization or bioﬁlm
without clinical evidence of infection. [GRADE - 2;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
The data available concerning the treatment of bacterial colonization of VLUs are insufﬁcient and contradictory. Sibbald et al found that high bacterial counts in
VLUs were associated with delayed healing.240 Improved
healing was associated with reduction in bacterial counts.
Davies et al suggested that bacterial density was predictive
of nonhealing of VLUs.122 However, Lantis and Gendics
found that when they treated VLUs with high bacterial
counts with topical antibiotics, bacterial counts decreased
but there was no correlation with improvement in wound
size.241 Finally, Moore et al reported that the speciﬁc bacterial species present or the number of species of bacteria
present did not relate to healing outcomes.118 They
concluded that their data supported no speciﬁc treatment
of wound bacteria regardless of the type or quantity. On
the basis of these contradictory ﬁndings, we are unable to
generate useful supporting clinical guidelines for treatment
of wound colonization or bioﬁlm without clinical evidence
of infection.

Guideline 4.11: Treatment of Wound Infection:
We suggest that venous leg ulcers with >1 3 106
CFU/g of tissue and clinical evidence of infection be
treated with antimicrobial therapy. [GRADE - 2;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C] We suggest antimicrobial
therapy for virulent or difﬁcult to eradicate bacteria
(such as beta-hemolytic streptococci, pseudomonas,
and resistant staphylococcal species) at lower levels
of colony-forming units per gram of tissue. [GRADE 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C] We suggest a combination of mechanical disruption and antibiotic therapy as most likely to be successful in eradicating
venous leg ulcer infection. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 4.12: Systemic Antibiotics
We recommend that venous leg ulcers with clinical
evidence of infection be treated with systemic antibiotics guided by sensitivities performed on wound culture. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Oral antibiotics
