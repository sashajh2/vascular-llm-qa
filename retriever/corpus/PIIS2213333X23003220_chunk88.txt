3% in the RFA
group.165 Postoperative pain was associated with
increased BMI and large vein diameter. For large
diameter veins, RFA was superior to stripping. These
data support that thermal ablation techniques are safe
and effective in treating large diameter saphenous
veins. There have been no large case series using
nonthermal techniques in large veins.
5.2.8. The incidence of superﬁcial thrombophlebitis
has been reported to be similar for thermal and
nonthermal ablations.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Different rates of postprocedure thrombophlebitis were reported for different ablation techniques,
but most RCTs and meta-analyses found no signiﬁcant
difference in the rates of thrombophlebitis as a minor
complication after endovenous ablations.166
Evidence. In one of the largest single center retrospective trials of 808 patients, Aurshina et al167 compared
acute thrombotic complications after EVLA with RFA.

The incidence of acute superﬁcial thrombosis in varicose
veins in the ipsilateral leg was 4.6%, and overall thrombotic complications occurred in 10.5%, more frequent
after EVLA than after RFA (11.4% vs 7.7%; P ¼ .007).
Thrombotic complications in this study, however, also
included EHIT. There was no difference in thrombophlebitis following EVLA and RFA in a systematic review
of 12 studies that included 1577 patients (RR, 1.03; 95% CI,
; 95% CI,0.56 to 1.92).166
When comparing nonthermal and thermal techniques,
a systematic review and meta-analysis by Hassanin et al21
found no signiﬁcant difference in phlebitis rates between
groups (pooled RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.32-1.54). Nonthermal
ablations in this study included mechanochemical ablation and cyanoacrylate vein ablations. A meta-analysis
from Chen et al22 found similar results, with no difference
in phle
