 <100 mg/dL or to <70 mg/dL in very
high-risk individuals.71 As noted above, the most recent
guidelines on lipid therapy focus on the estimation of 10year cardiovascular risk rather than speciﬁc lipid levels.
Although PAD per se is not included in the suggested
risk estimation algorithm, historical data suggest that all
PAD patients would meet the suggested threshold of a
7.5% 10-year risk. It is noteworthy that speciﬁc low-density
lipoprotein targets have never been validated in the PAD population, who commonly demonstrate a phenotype of dyslipidemia (low high-density lipoprotein, elevated triglycerides),
which contrasts with typical patients with isolated coronary
artery disease. Statin therapy has also improved pain-free
walking time in small studies of patients with IC.72,73 The
mechanism of this action is unknown. However, in the Claudication: Exercise vs Endoluminal Revascularization
(CLEVER) trial,74 conventional medical therapy, including
statins for atherosclerosis, did not signiﬁcantly improve
walking ability or symptoms in patients with IC compared
with supervised exercise or stenting (Section 5C).
Diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of PAD in patients
with diabetes mellitus is estimated to be 29%.75 Although it
is unknown whether aggressive treatment to optimize
serum glucose levels decreases the likelihood of adverse
cardiovascular events in these patients, atherosclerosis tends
to be more aggressive, and amputation rates in diabetic
patients with atherosclerosis of the lower extremity are ﬁve
to 10 times higher than in nondiabetic counterparts. Sensory neuropathy and increased susceptibility to infection
contribute to the elevated rate of amputation.9
Hypertension. There is a strong association between
hypertension and cardiovascular disease, including PAD;
however, the relative risk is less for hypertension than for
smoking or diabetes. Treatment of hypertension is indicated
to reduce cardiovascular events, including congestive heart
failure, stroke, and death.76 There is no evidence that badrenergic blockers worsen the symptoms of IC.77
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) reduce
the risk of death and nonfatal cardiac events in patients with
left ventricular dysfunction.7
