 and 78% at 12 and 60 months, respectively.514
Embolic protection should be used if anatomically
feasible.
Tandem lesions include patients with signiﬁcant ICA
stenosis in combination with proximal ipsilateral common carotid or innominate stenosis of greater than
50%. Although open reconstructions may be technically
feasible, small case series suggest that a hybrid approach
with CEA and retrograde CCA/innominate stent may
have improved morbidity and mortality compared with
an open approach.521-523
Summary and recommendations.
1. Interventions (open or endovascular) to treat proximal
CCA or innominate artery critical lesions are not suggested in asymptomatic patients.
2. In symptomatic patients, the choice of open (cervical
vs transthoracic), hybrid, or endovascular treatment is
dependent on patient anatomy and comorbidities.
Embolic protection is suggested for endovascular
intervention if feasible.

THERAPY OF CONCURRENT CORONARY AND
CAROTID DISEASE
(See also Clinical Practice Guidelines document.)
Carotid stenosis of greater than 50% occurs in 9% of
coronary artery bypass (CABG) patients, and carotid stenosis of greater than 80% stenosis occurs in 7% of
CABG patients.524 Although overall perioperative stroke
prevalence with CABG is 1% to 2%, stroke risk increases
as high as 7% to 9% in patients with 50% to 100% carotid
stenosis,524,525 and 18% and 26% after CABG in patients

with symptomatic unilateral and bilateral carotid stenosis, respectively.526 If carotid occlusion is present, risk of
perioperative stroke increases to 7% to 12%.527-530 It is unknown whether carotid stenosis itself speciﬁcally increases stroke risk in patients undergoing CABG or
whether carotid stenosis is a marker of diffuse atherosclerotic disease. Even the presence of a bruit increases
the risk of
