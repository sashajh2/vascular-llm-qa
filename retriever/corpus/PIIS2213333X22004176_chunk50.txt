patients who had undergone standalone ablation of the
AAGSV at 6 months, suggesting that patients with a
symptomatic AAGSV treated with ablation will also require
treatment of the associated tributaries (varicosities) to
achieve outcomes similar to those for patients who had
undergone GSV ablation.57
Guideline 3. Thermal ablation vs nonthermal ablation
of saphenous veins
Guideline 3.1.
3.1.1. For patients with symptomatic axial reﬂux of
the GSV, we recommend both thermal and
nonthermal ablation from the groin to below the
knee, depending on the available expertise of the
treating physician and the preference of the patient.
Level of recommendation: grade 1 (strong), quality of
evidence: B (moderate)
3.1.2. For patients with symptomatic axial reﬂux of
the SSV, we recommend both thermal and
nonthermal ablation from the knee to the upper or
mid-calf, depending on the available expertise of the
treating physician and the preference of the patient.
Level of recommendation: grade 1 (strong), quality of
evidence: C (low to very low)
3.1.3. For patients with symptomatic axial reﬂux of
the AAGSV or PAGSV, we suggest either thermal or
nonthermal ablation, with additional phlebectomy, if
needed, depending on the available expertise of the
treating physician and the preference of the patient.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak), quality of
evidence: C (low to very low)
Rationale. Both thermal and nonthermal ablation
techniques are minimally invasive, percutaneous ofﬁcebased procedures. Thermal ablation (EVLA86,87;
RFA64,88,89) requires tumescent local anesthesia, which
can cause pain and discomfort during the procedure.
Nonthermal ablations include UGFS with physiciancompounded foam using the Tessari technique98,99 or
the use of PEM (Varithena).100 Other nonthermal ablation
techniques include CAC12,90,91 using the VenaSeal system
(Medtronic) or the Turkish glue kit (Vari
