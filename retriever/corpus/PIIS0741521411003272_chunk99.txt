 noted that the data support less bruising and less pain with the new RF catheter system than with
the 980-nm EVLA. However, further trials with higherwavelength EVLA, as well as with long-term follow-up, are
needed before any conclusion on the use of any EVLA vs
RFA can be made.
Hemodynamic improvement after saphenous ablations. In a comparative nonrandomized study, Marston et
al287 observed both hemodynamic and clinical improvement in patients treated by either RFA or laser. These
authors reported significant improvements in venous filling
time and in VCSS, with no differences between the groups.
Sclerotherapy
Injection of a chemical into the vein to achieve endoluminal fibrosis and obstruction of the vein has been used
for almost a century.288 Sigg et al,289,290 Fegan et al,291,292
Tournay,293 and Wallois294 are considered the pioneers of
liquid sclerotherapy, whereas Hobbs295 was the first to
provide scientific evidence on the clinical outcome after
sclerotherapy compared with surgery. Sclerotherapy in
some European countries, especially in France, has been a
very popular treatment for varicose veins.296-299 Although
liquid sclerotherapy has been used primarily for obliteration
of spider veins or telangiectasia (veins ⱕ3 mm in diameter),
interest in the use of sclerotherapy greatly increased when
Cabrera et al300 reported in 1995 that foam prepared by
mixing a “physiologic gas” with the detergent polidocanol
was effective for obstruction of larger veins. Ultrasonographically guided foam sclerotherapy has rapidly spread
for treatment of primary and recurrent varicose veins, including the GSV and SSV, perforating veins, and venous
malformations.301-311
