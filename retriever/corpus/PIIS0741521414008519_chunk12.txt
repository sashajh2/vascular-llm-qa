COMPRESSION
Guideline 5.1: CompressiondUlcer Healing
In a patient with a venous leg ulcer, we recommend compression therapy over no compression therapy to increase venous leg ulcer healing rate. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - A]
Guideline 5.2: CompressiondUlcer Recurrence
In a patient with a healed venous leg ulcer, we suggest compression therapy to decrease the risk of ulcer recurrence. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]

Guideline 5.3: Multicomponent Compression Bandage
We suggest the use of multicomponent compression bandage over single-component bandages for the treatment of venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 5.4: CompressiondArterial Insufﬁciency
In a patient with a venous leg ulcer and underlying arterial disease, we do not suggest compression bandages or
stockings if the ankle-brachial index is 0.5 or less or if absolute ankle pressure is less than 60 mm Hg. [GRADE - 2;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 5.5: Intermittent Pneumatic Compression
We suggest use of intermittent pneumatic compression when other compression options are not available,
cannot be used, or have failed to aid in venous leg ulcer healing after prolonged compression therapy. [GRADE - 2;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
OPERATIVE/ENDOVASCULAR MANAGEMENT
Guideline 6.1: Superﬁcial Venous Reﬂux and Active Venous Leg UlcerdUlcer Healing
In a patient with a venous leg ulcer (C6) and incompetent superﬁcial veins that have axial reﬂux directed to the
bed of the ulcer, we suggest ablation of the incompetent veins in addition to standard compressive therapy to
improve ulcer healing. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 6.2: Superﬁcial Venous Reﬂux and Active Venous Leg UlcerdPrevent Recurrence
In a patient with a venous leg ulcer (C
