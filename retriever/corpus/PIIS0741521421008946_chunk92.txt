Systemic/meta-analysis

Patch material during CEA

Bond et al, 2004304,c (Cochrane review)

1280 patients
7 RCTs

No obvious differences in perioperative stroke/death rate using synthetic or vein patch
No differences in long-term follow-up
Risk of major arterial complications (patch infection/rupture) <1% on vein and synthetic patches
3 of 348 (0.9%) had vein patch blowout, 1 fatal
2 of 359 (0.6%) had synthetic patch rupture, 1 fatal

Texakalidis et al, 2018310

3,234 patients
18 studies

30 day stroke, MI, wound infection, death, cranial nerve palsy, carotid artery
thrombosis and death, long-term stroke and restenosis were similar between
venous vs synthetic patch
No differences in 30-day stroke, death, TIA, carotid artery thrombosis and
long-term restenosis were detected between Dacron and synthetic polytetraﬂuoroethylene patch

CI, Conﬁdence interval; ePTFE, expanded polytetraﬂuoroethylene; MI, myocardial infarction; OR, odds ratio; RCT, randomized controlled trial; TIA,
transient ischemic attack.
a
Not available or not applicable.
b
Conventional PTFE vs collagen-impregnated Dacron patch (Hemashield).
c
ACUSEAL vs Finesse (Ultrathin Dacron) (PTFE).
d
Transient ischemic attack/stroke.
e
Restenosis of $70%.

samples of eversion endarterectomy in which 1855 patients underwent 2244 CEAs using the eversion technique. In this study, 410 patients had 474 CEAs by the
standard technique. Operative mortality risk was 1% on
the eversion group
