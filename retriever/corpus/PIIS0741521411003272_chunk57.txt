We suggest compression therapy using moderate pressure (20 to 30 mm Hg) for
patients with symptomatic varicose veins.
We recommend against compression therapy as the primary treatment of
symptomatic varicose veins in patients who are candidates for saphenous vein
ablation.
We recommend compression as the primary therapeutic modality for healing
venous ulcers.
We recommend compression as an adjuvant treatment to superficial vein ablation
for the prevention of ulcer recurrence.

introduced intraluminal stripping from the ankle to the
groin. High ligation and ankle-to-groin stripping using a
metal or, later, a disposable Codman or Myers stripper has
become the technique of choice to remove the saphenous
vein. Recognition of frequent saphenous nerve injury during ankle-to-groin stripping and a better understanding of
the venous hemodynamics changed the technique to a
limited, groin-to-knee stripping.165
The invagination technique using a silk thread was
perfected by Van Der Stricht166 and using the Myers stripper, without the acorn-shaped head, by Fullarton and Calvert,167 while perforate invaginate (PIN) stripping was
introduced by Oesch168 and perfected in the United States
by Goren and Yellin.169 Varicose vein excision performed

powered phlebectomy174-176 have been adopted.
