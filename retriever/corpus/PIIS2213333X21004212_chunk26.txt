57,58,71,104,109). No
statistically signiﬁcant association was found when HL/S
was compared with EVLA (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.77-1.27;
I2 ¼ 74.6%; 12 studies34,37,49,61-64,69,73,101,104,108). HL/S was
associated with lower risk of total AEs compared with
UGFS (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58-0.85; I2 ¼ 28.3%; 7
studies26,32,56,66,101,104,108).
There were no differences for short-, intermediate-, or
long-term outcomes such, as the Aberdeen Varicose Vein
Questionnaire, Aberdeen Varicose Vein Symptom Score,
Homburg Varicose Vein Severity Score, venous disability
score, Venous Clinical Severity Score, pulmonary embolism,
pain scale, DVT, propagation of thrombus, recurrent ulceration, thrombophlebitis, other minor AEs such as (vein
tear, development of thread vein, telangiectatic matting,
lipodermatosclerosis, keloid, phlebitis-like reaction, persistent compression, nausea, headache, and migraine), and
other total AEs when HL/S compared with different endovenous ablation techniques. Outcomes are presented in
Supplementary Table V (online only).
Small saphenous vein studies. We included two RCTs
(3 publications43,52,53) that compared HL/S with EVLA.
The two RCTs had an intermediate risk of bias. The studies
reported on 281 patients (mean age, 49.6 years; 68.4%
women) with CEAP class C2 to C6. One of the RCTs43,53
(HELP-2 [The Hull Endovenous Laser Project 2]) demonstrated that, when compared with EVLA, HL/S was associated with lower anatomic closure rates at one month
