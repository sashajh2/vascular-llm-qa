 MRA sequences can
be more time-consuming than contrast-enhanced
MRA, non-contrast-enhanced MRA has almost the
same sensitivity for detecting vascular abnormalities
and a high negative predictive value. Non-contrastenhanced MRA (like contrast-enhanced MRA) can be superior and complementary to ultrasound in evaluating
most parts of the body because it is not limited by acoustic windows, particularly in the thoracoabdominal vasculature.202-204

2. Size criteria for invasive intervention
Recommended intervention criteria for PDAA and GDAA
Recommendation
2.1

In patients with noncomplicated GDAA and PDAA of acceptable operative risk, we
recommend treatment no matter the size of the aneurysm because of the risk of
rupture.

Non-contrast-enhanced CT scans may show only a soft
tissue mass in the aneurysm bed that can be confused
with
adenopathy
or
pancreatic
or
duodenal
neoplasm.160,194
Contrast-enhanced MRA has been shown to correlate
well with CTA,86 but it should not be used in emergent
cases as acquisition times are longer than for CTA.197
Postprocessing maximum intensity projection images
are similar to those of conventional angiography,
providing a roadmap for therapeutic interventions.179
Finally, duplex ultrasound may delineate larger aneurysms, but information on parent artery anatomy is insufﬁcient.59 Accuracy can be decreased because of the
patient’s body habitus, calciﬁed vessel walls, and limited
spatial resolution.198,199
Duplex ultrasound is one of the most common diagnostic techniques used to evaluate the celiac axis for median arcuate ligament syndrome.200 It can provide realtime inspiratory and expiratory data, helping elucidate
the cause of the GDAA or PDAA and its treatment.201

Previous studies have made the distinction in size
threshold for repair of visceral artery aneurysms on the
basis of whether the aneurysm is a true aneurysm or a
pseudoaneurysm.205 This is based on the fact that pseudoaneur
