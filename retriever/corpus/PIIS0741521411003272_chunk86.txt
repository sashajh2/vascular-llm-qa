 RF catheter system, sequential heating of
the vein is performed at 7-cm intervals, heating the vein to
120°C in each 20-second cycle. The first segment is treated
twice. At the end of the procedure, the saphenous vein is
reimaged to confirm successful obliteration and absence of
thrombus protrusion into the femoral vein or, if the SSV
was treated, into the popliteal vein. If a patent segment is
identified, re-treatment is advisable.
Postprocedural care. Graduated compression stockings with an ankle pressure of 30 to 40 mm Hg or an elastic
or nonelastic wrap is placed on the leg at the end of the
procedure. Early ambulation is encouraged, and the patient
leaves for home a few hours after the procedure. Recent
evidence supports elastic compression for at least 1 week
after superficial venous interventions.205 During this time,
the patient is asked to have compression of the leg day and
night. Although the risk of DVT, heat-induced thrombus
extension, or PE is rare263,264 and therefore the yield is low,
we suggest postprocedural duplex scanning within 24 to 72
hours to exclude any thrombotic complication. Evidence to
support this recommendation is of low quality (GRADE
2C).
Thrombosis prophylaxis. Data to support the routine administration of thromboprophylaxis with heparin are
not available. Selected patients with a history of thrombophlebitis, DVT, known thrombophilia, or obesity are candidates for thrombosis prophylaxis.159 In one case series,
age ⬎50 years was a predictor of heat-induced thrombus
extension into the femoral vein.246 Lawrence et al262 reported 500 patients who underwent RFA, and 13 (2.6%)
experienced thrombus bulging into the femoral vein or
adherent to its wall, which was treated with low-molecularweight heparin. All of these patients had thrombus retraction to the level of the SFJ in an average of 16 days. A
significantly higher rate of proximal thrombus extension
was noted in those patients with a history of D
