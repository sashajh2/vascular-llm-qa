 cuff and a hand-held, continuous-wave Doppler probe. The
patient should be in the supine position and allowed to rest before the examination begins.
The blood pressure cuff is placed above the ankle. The Doppler probe is used to locate the
dorsalis pedis (DP) or posterior tibial (PT) pulse, the cuff is infated until the Doppler signal
is obliterated, and then the cuff is then slowly released; the pressure at which the Doppler
signal returns is the ankle pressure. The same process is repeated for both legs (DP and PT
signals) and both arms. The arm pressure must be conducted with the manual blood pressure
cuff that is placed above the target vessel and the Doppler probe that is placed below the cuff
to evaluate blood fow. To calculate the ABI, the higher ankle pressure (DP or PT) is divided
by the highest arm pressure (left or right).

ABI result of <0.9 has shown to have high sensitivity and specificity with identifying PAD.
Patients with claudication usually have an ABI ranging from 0.5 to 0.9, and those with ischemic
rest pain or tissue loss usually have an ABI less than 0.5.
Ĺ Note
Below are the parameters used to diagnose PAD using ABI values.
1. ABI of >1.2: Calcification of arteries, non-compressible. Seen in diabetic patients.
2. ABI of 0.9 – 1.2: Normal
3. ABI of <0.9: Suggests arterial stenosis. (Khan, Farooqui, and Niazi 2008)
- ABI 0.7-0.9 = mild PAD
- ABI 0.4-0.7 = moderate PAD
- ABI <0.4 = severe PAD
ABI 0.5 - 0.9: often causes claudication
ABI <0.5: often causes ischemic rest pain/tissue loss
Below, we will review how to calculate the ABI for the right and left lower extremity using
the following values:
