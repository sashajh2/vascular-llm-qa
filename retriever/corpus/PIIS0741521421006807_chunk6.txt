 presenting with atherosclerotic arterial occlusive disease. A high index of suspicion is, therefore, necessary to distinguish patients with chronically symptomatic
PAAs from those with symptoms due to peripheral arterial
occlusive disease (PAD). PAAs can also present with
rupture, although this is rare.1 Compressive symptoms
resulting in venous congestion, leg swelling, deep vein
thrombosis, and/or neuropathy have also been reported
but are very uncommon.1,2
Frequently, the patient history will not be diagnostic
and the physical examination ﬁndings will be insensitive
even when detecting a prominent popliteal artery. The
diagnosis of PAA, therefore, requires conﬁrmatory imaging studies, which will also be helpful in treatment
planning.24
Duplex ultrasound (DUS) has been shown to be highly
sensitive and speciﬁc for the detection of PAAs, with a reported accuracy close to 100%.24,25 Computed
