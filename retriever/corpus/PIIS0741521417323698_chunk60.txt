 wall stiffness,206-208 wall tension,209 and
peak AAA wall stress.210-212
Hall and colleagues have suggested that rupture is
imminent above a critical aortic wall stress, predicted
by the law of Laplace and maximum AAA diameter.209
Several other investigators subsequently demonstrated
that wall stress is highly dependent on AAA shape rather
than diameter alone.210-216 With ultrasound-based
assessment, determination of peak wall stress may
soon be translatable to real-time assessment of the patient.217 Modeling by computational ﬂuid dynamics has
suggested that intraluminal hemodynamic conditions
also inﬂuence AAA growth, remodeling, and risk of
rupture.218-222
The peak wall rupture index considers both peak wall
stress and residual wall strength and has been proposed
as more predictive than estimates of peak wall stress
alone.223-225 Further analyses have also incorporated the
inﬂuence of intraluminal hemodynamic conditions on
wall stress and strength indices through ﬂuid structure
interaction simulations.226,227 The value of CTdetermined intraluminal thrombus volume228,229 as
well as positron emission tomography-CT imaging in
predicting rupture risk remains uncertain.230,231 The
utility of positron emission tomography may require
the development of AAA-speciﬁc radiotracer agents.232
Beyond an assessment of rupture risk, there is a clear
role for imaging-based criteria for the prediction of
disease progression. As revealed in surveillance studies,
many small AAAs do not enlarge.233 Molecular imaging
of pathologic processes characteristic of aortic degeneration, including angiogenesis,234 matrix disruption,235
activated macrophage localization,236 and proteolysis,237
is being translated to the clinic238-241 and may help identify those patients with an increased likelihood of disease
progression.
Gender-speciﬁc rupture indicators have been evaluated, given the increased risk for rupture in women at
any given aortic diameter. A recent computational study
of patient-speciﬁc anatomy using ﬁnite element analysis
was unable to identify signiﬁcant
