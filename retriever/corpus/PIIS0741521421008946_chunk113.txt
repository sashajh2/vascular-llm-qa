CA over
the microwire. The microwire and dilator are removed and
a cervical carotid angiography with road mapping or fade
in and out digital subtraction is performed with different
oblique views to delineate the bifurcation. If the external
carotid artery is open with no lesion at the bifurcation, the
wire is advanced into ECA followed by the 5-F microsheath
with dilator (ECA engaging technique). The 0.035-inch wire
is then advanced in the microsheath into the ECA. This
technique allows a for few additional centimeters of purchase. If the lesion involves the bifurcation or if the ECA is
signiﬁcantly narrowed, stay short technique is recommended with advancing of the microsheath followed by
the 0.035 wire into distal CCA but staying short of the lesion.
Next, an 8F sheath is advanced over a 0.035 wire carefully
with gentle traction on the umbilical tape on the CCA. At
least two angiography views are performed through the
sheath to conﬁrm proper position. Technical advantages of
this technique include ease of direct access, use of short
wire and catheters, and the ability to clamp the proximal
CCA providing CEA-like cerebral protection before lesion
manipulation. Prior studies demonstrate a signiﬁcant
decrease in the incidence of silent ischemic lesions after
TCAR compared with transfemoral CAS using diffusionweighted MRI.380,381 The risk of DWI in the ICSS study was
17% in the CEA arm vs 73% in the transfemoral CAS arm.382
The PROOF study showed 18% risk of DWI after TCAR with
ﬂow reversal and proximal CCA clamping.380
Summary and recommendations.
Access.
1. Proper imaging of the aortic arch and carotid bifurcation are recommended preoperatively.
2. Transfemoral access can be used in younger patients
and aortic arch free of obvious disease.
3. Transradial and transbrachial access is especially
beneﬁcial in left ICA lesions in patients with bovine
anatomy or prior carotid subclavian bypass.
4. TCAR
