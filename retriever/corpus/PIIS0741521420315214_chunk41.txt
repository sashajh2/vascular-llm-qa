 “rapid expansion” should be individualized and

should take into account the comorbidities of the patients, their expected longevity, and risk factors for a poor
outcome after TEVAR.
Recommendation 11: We recommend TEVAR in
asymptomatic patients with a descending TAA when
the maximum aneurysm diameter exceeds 5.5 cm in
“low-risk” patients with favorable aortic anatomy. Level
of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 12: We suggest using higher aortic
diameter thresholds for TEVAR in patients deemed to
have a particularly high risk of death, renal failure, or
paraplegia from the procedure, where the beneﬁt of
treatment is lower than the risk posed by the natural history of the TAA. Level of recommendation: Grade 2
(Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low)
TEVAR for IMH and PAU. As mentioned previously,
IMH, PAU, and AD may be similar pathologic processes
along a spectrum of aortic disease or may occur in isolation, and therefore a discussion of the use of TEVAR for
dissection will be undertaken in another SVS document.
Patients with asymptomatic, acute IMH may often be
managed conservatively with optimal medical therapy
in an intensive care setting. According to a contemporary systematic review of 925 patients with IMH, the predictors of complications include persistent pain,
hemodynamic instability, maximum aortic diameter
>45 mm, IMH wall thickness >10 mm, presence of
ulcer-like projections, pleural effusion or hemomediastinum, and periaortic hemorrhage.97 The 3-year aortarelated mortality was 5.4% with medical treatment,
23% with open surgery, and 7.1% with endovascular
therapy.97 Because of the dynamic nature of IMH and its
association with AD (AD in evolution), close observation
and hypertension control with follow-up imaging are
warranted.
Recommendation 13: Because of the dynamic nature
of isolated IMH and its known association with AD, we
recommend close observation and hypertension control
with follow-up imaging as the initial management of patients with asymptomatic IMH. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence
