 stress on the vessel walls, enhancing collateral vessel growth. Furthermore, physical activity increases oxygen demand of the active tissues creating a
relative hypoxic environment, leading to collateralization/angiogenesis/arteriogenesis as
described above. This is why dedicated exercise is an important aspect of treatment for
claudication.
The development of collateral circulation in PAD is a gradual process that occurs over time
in response to the chronic reduction in blood fow. While collateralization can help improve
perfusion to some extent, it may not fully compensate for the lost function of the original,
diseased arteries. In advanced stages of PAD, when the arterial obstruction is severe, collateralization may become insuï¬€cient, leading to continued symptoms of intermittent claudication,
pain, and impaired wound healing.

Anatomic Distribution of PAD
The distribution of disease in PAD varies among different risk groups such as smokers and
diabetics. Smokers tend to develop PAD predominantly in the infrainguinal arteries (CFA,
SFA, PFA, popliteal artery), while diabetics tend to have higher infrapopliteal disease patterns
(AT, TP, peroneal, DP). (Conte et al. 2019a)
Smoking is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis, which is the primary underlying cause of
PAD. Atherosclerosis tends to affect larger and proximal arteries, including the femoral and
popliteal arteries, in smokers. The buildup of atherosclerotic plaques narrows these arteries,
reducing blood fow to the lower extremities and causing symptoms like claudication.
Diabetes is associated with a specific type of arterial disease known as diabetic vasculopathy
or microangiopathy. This condition leads to changes in the smaller blood vessels, including
the tibial arteries and peroneal artery. The tibial arteries play a critical role in supplying
blood to the feet, making them susceptible to diabetic vascular complications. Therefore, the
microvascular changes associated with diabetes result in a distal distribution of arterial disease
(i.e. toes and feet first).

Diagnostics and Imaging
Measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) is the primary method for establishing the
diagnosis of PAD, however, a proper physical exam helps confirm the diagnosis of claudication.

Peripheral Pulse Exam
In terms of physical exam, claudicants may
