appear to alter rupture risk, but an increased risk of
rupture has been reported for patients who recently discontinued ACE inhibitors.293
Some have suggested that serologic evidence of Chlamydophila pneumoniae infection may be associated
with AAA expansion,294 but a prospective randomized
trial demonstrated that azithromycin had no effect on
aneurysm enlargement.295 Doxycycline can inhibit
matrix metalloproteinases in plasma and aneurysm tissue and thus has been proposed as an agent to limit
AAA growth.296,297 However, a randomized trial of
low-dose doxycycline (100 mg once daily) demonstrated
no reduction in aneurysm growth during an 18-month
period.298 An ongoing National Institutes of Health trial
is examining the effectiveness of a higher dose of doxycycline (100 mg twice daily).
In summary, during the surveillance period, patients
should be counseled to cease smoking if tobacco products are being used. Patients should be encouraged to
seek appropriate medical management for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and other atherosclerotic
risk factors. A statin and ACE inhibitor should be considered, given the broad potential beneﬁts to cardiovascular disease and acceptable safety proﬁle. Insufﬁcient
data currently exist to recommend use of doxycycline
or roxithromycin. Patients should be counseled that
moderate physical activity does not precipitate rupture
or inﬂuence AAA growth rate.41,299

We recommend smoking cessation to reduce the risk of AAA
growth and rupture.
Level of recommendation

1 (Strong)

Quality of evidence

B (Moderate)

We suggest not administering statins, doxycycline,
roxithromycin, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor
blockers for the sole purpose of reducing the risk of AAA
expansion and rupture.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

We suggest not administering beta blocker therapy for the
sole purpose of reducing the risk of AAA expansion and
rupture.
