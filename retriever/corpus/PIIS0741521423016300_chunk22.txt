 ratio [PLR] 1.84 e 2.46).44,45 The PLR gives the
change in odds of experiencing an outcome if the test is
positive, whereas the negative likelihood ratio (NLR) expresses a change in odds of experiencing an outcome if
the test is negative. A PLR or NLR of 1.0 means that the
test does not change the probability of the outcome over
and above the pre-test probability and therefore is not a
useful diagnostic test. However, it is important to recognise that pulse palpation should be performed, and results considered in the context of other clinical
examinations that may be associated with PAD
including hair loss, muscle atrophy, and reduced peripheral skin temperature. It should be noted that these
clinical examinations are highly subjective and such
Ô¨Åndings may also be associated with neuropathy. PAD
may also be asymptomatic or have an atypical presentation in people with diabetes as in other elderly or at risk
populations.27,46,47 For example, peripheral neuropathy
can mask pain symptoms and autonomic neuropathy
can result in a warm foot, meaning that the widely recognised signs and symptoms of PAD may not be
present.48

These recommendations are applicable to all people
with diabetes. When DFU is absent, but there are clinical
signs and symptoms of PAD or PAD is suspected, for
example due to long standing diabetes, chronic hyperglycaemia, other diabetes complications such as peripheral neuropathy, or the presence of atherosclerotic
disease in other vascular beds, more frequent screening
vascular assessment including additional bedside testing
is necessary. These recommendations are consistent with
other (inter)national guidelines on the management of
diabetes, endorsing annual clinical assessment for PAD
(and for other foot complications) in people with
diabetes.49e52
Although based on low quality evidence, data demonstrating increased likelihood of PAD in those with weak
or absent pulses and elevated risk of cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality support the preference of a person with diabetes for clinical examination including
pulse palpation to be performed.5,35 The non-invasive nature of clinical examination and pulse palpation suggest
that these assessments would be valued by people with
diabetes as initial diagnostic tests. As equipment is not
required, the Writing Committee considered pulse
