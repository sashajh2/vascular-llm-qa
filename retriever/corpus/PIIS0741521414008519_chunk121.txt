nourished.450,451 Deﬁciency in vitamins A and E,
carotene, proteins, and zinc was found in patients with
VLUs.452 In addition, elderly individuals susceptible to
development of ulcers may have insufﬁcient intake of proteins, vitamins, and minerals.453-455 These patients demonstrate improved ulcer healing rates when these deﬁciencies
are corrected. However, no beneﬁcial effect was demonstrated in supplementing patients without deﬁciencies.450

Whereas one small study456 reported healing of 13 of 18
patients with VLUs refractory to treatment after 4 months
of oral administration of zinc sulfate (220 mg three times
daily), ﬁve other trials failed to conﬁrm these results.457
Guideline 7.2: Systemic Drug Therapy
For long-standing or large venous leg ulcer, we
recommend treatment with either pentoxifylline or
micronized puriﬁed ﬂavonoid fraction used in combination with compression therapy. [GRADE - 1;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Several systemic drugs have been evaluated for their
potential role in improving VLU healing. Noting the limitation of oxygen diffusion in ulcerations by a pericapillary
ﬁbrin cuff,458,459 an RCT comparing stanozolol (anabolic
steroid with proﬁbrinolytic effect) with placebo was performed, but despite previously demonstrated activity on lipodermatosclerosis in CVD, the drug failed to show
superiority over placebo.460 A randomized multicenter
placebo-controlled trial of another proﬁbrinolytic and
antithrombotic drug, sulodexide (puriﬁed glycosaminoglycan), was encouraging and showed improved VLU healing in 235 patients treated for 3 months.461 Platelet
inhibitors have also been studied in RCTs of VLUs, but
aspirin and ifetroban (oral thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist) have failed to show beneﬁcial effect on healing.462,463
