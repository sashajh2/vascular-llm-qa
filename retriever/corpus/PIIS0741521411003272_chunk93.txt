 EVLT limbs. Two GSVs in the
EVLT group reopened and five partially reopened, but no
open GSVs occurred in HL/S limbs. The authors concluded that long-term follow-up is still needed to justify
EVLA vs HL/S.
The Committee noted that four of the seven trials had
short follow-up and two trials had funding from a commercial company. Overall, the quality of evidence for safety and
early efficacy was high, but evidence for long-term effectiveness in these randomized studies was of low quality.
Perioperative pain was higher in the EVLA groups in two
studies, but postoperative hematomas were less frequent.
As also stated by Thakur at al,276 meaningful comparison
across randomized studies of endovenous treatments is
difficult because of considerable variations in study populations and outcome measures between trials.
Results of RFA. Nicolini277 reported 3-year results
after RFA using the first-generation device in 330 limbs and
observed a total occlusion rate of 75%, partial occlusion
(⬍5-cm open segment) in 18%, and incomplete occlusion
(⬎5-cm open segment) in 7%. The total occlusion rate in
multiple studies using the first-generation device ranged
from 75% to 92%, with a partial occlusion rate of between
7% and 26%.195,257,278,279
Long-term results of the Closure Study Group at 5
years after RFA using the same device were published by
Merchant et al254 in 2005. The multicenter prospective
registry comprised data from ⬎1200 treated limbs. Occlusion rates at 1, 2, and 5 years were 87.1%, 88.2%, and
87.2%, respectively. Duplex ultrasonography identified 185
limbs that had one of the following modes of anatomic
failure:
Type I failure (nonocclusion): The treated vein failed to
occlude initially and never occluded during the follow-up
(12.4%).
Type II failure (recanalization): The vein occluded after
treatment but recanalized, partly or completely, at a later
time (69.7
