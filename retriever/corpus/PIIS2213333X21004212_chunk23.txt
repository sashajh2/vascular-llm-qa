 ¼ 78.2%; 4 studies27,47,49,105).
Additionally, compared with HL/S, EVLA was associated
with a higher patient satisfaction scores (SMD, e0.63;
95% CI, e0.87 to e0.38; I2 ¼ 56.7%; 1 study28). Compared
with UGFS, HL/S was associated with signiﬁcant improvement of ulcer healing (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.05-1.69; 1 study26)
and lower risk of reintervention (RR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.25-0.86;
I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies100,105).
Outcomes at 5 years.
Anatomic closure. HL/S was associated with a higher
anatomic closure rate than UGFS (RR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.092.13; 1 study111). No statistically signiﬁcant association was
found when HL/S was compared with EVLA (RR, 1.03;
95% CI, 0.86-1.25; 1 study106).
Quality of life. There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in the generic QoL score between HL/S and EVLA
(SMD, 0.04; 95% CI, -0.14 to 0.22; I2 ¼ 40.6%; 3
studies50,59,107). Disease-speciﬁc QoL 5 years after treatment was better after HL/S than after UGFS (2.60; 95%
CI, 3.99 to 1.22; P < .001).102
Recurrent varicosity. Compared with RFA, HL/S was
signiﬁcantly associated with recurrent varicosity (RR,
2.00; 95% CI, 1.22-3.27; 1 study103). No statistically
