 Intact sensation and 2+ strength throughout lower extremities.

Laboratory Findings:


Complete Blood Count (CBC): Within normal limits.
Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP): Normal renal and hepatic function.
Hemoglobin A1c: 6.7% (consistent with his known diabetes).
D-dimer: Elevated at 600 ng/mL (normal < 500 ng/mL), suggesting ongoing low-grade
thrombotic activity or venous insuï¬€ciency.

Imaging
Bilateral Venous Duplex Ultrasound
Impression: - Findings reveal bilateral superficial venous refux in the great saphenous veins
(GSVs) with retrograde fow into the femoral vein. - Deep venous system is patent with no
evidence of acute or chronic deep vein thrombosis (DVT). - Perforator veins are dilated and
incompetent bilaterally.

Note
By the end of this chapter, students will:
 Be able to define endovascular surgery.
 Be able to elaborate on the key principles of arterial access, wires, catheters, and
sheaths.
 Be able to outline the steps and associated risks of common endovascular surgeries.
 Be able to outline new developments in endovascular surgery.

Key Facts
1. Endovascular surgery is a minimally invasive approach to treat a variety of vascular
pathologies, including peripheral artery disease, aortic aneurysms, venous diseases,
and others by deploying baloons, stents, and or endografts.
2. The common femoral artery (CFA) is the most common site of access for endovascular surgery due to its larger size and lower risk of complications relative to other
sites of vascular access
3. Using the analogy of a train on a track passing through a tunnel, a catheter can be
thought of as the train, a wire as the train track, and a sheath as the
