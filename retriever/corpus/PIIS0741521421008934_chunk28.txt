). In a single-center
series, Sharpe et al55 reported a 30-day death and stroke
rate of 2.4% when patients had undergone CEA within
48 hours of symptom onset. Other registry data from Germany, Sweden, the United States, and single-series reports from the United States have shown equally good
results for CEA performed within the ﬁrst week but not
within the ﬁrst 48 hours.56-59 In an analysis of the VQI of
8408 patients, the results were comparable among the
patients who had undergone surgery after 48 hours
but <14 days after stroke and those who had undergone
surgery >14 days after the index event.59 When the cohorts were stratiﬁed by 3 to 8 days and 8 to 14 days, the
multivariate analysis demonstrated that performing
CEA at 3 to 7 days after stroke was protective for postoperative stroke/death (P ¼ .003) and any postoperative
complication (P ¼ .028). The investigators concluded
that surgery should be delayed for $48 hours after acute
stroke and should be performed within 14 days after the
stroke.59 Avgerinos et al60 corroborated these data, suggesting CEAs performed 2 to 5 days after the index
neurologic event will have outcomes similar to the outcomes of CEAs performed later.
These ﬁndings conﬁrmed the results of an analysis of
the Swedish Vascular Registry, including 2596 patients
who had undergone CEA for symptomatic carotid stenosis, including stroke. The combined stroke/death
rate was 11.5% among those who had undergone

surgery within the ﬁrst 2 days of the neurologic event
compared with 3.6%, 4.0%, and 5.4% among those
who had undergone CEA at 3 to 7, 8 to 14, and 15 to
180 days after the acute neurologic event, respectively.
A multivariate analysis demonstrated that patients
who underwent CEA within the ﬁrst 2 days after an
acute neurologic event experienced a relative OR of
