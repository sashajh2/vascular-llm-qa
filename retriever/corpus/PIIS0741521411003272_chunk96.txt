group had faster recovery, less postoperative pain, fewer
adverse events, and superior QOL scores (P ⬍ .05). Clinical
and hemodynamic outcomes of RFA were comparable to
vein stripping at 2 years. The study found that at 2 years,
91.2% of limbs in the RFA group were free of superficial
reflux vs 91.7% in the surgical group (P ⫽ NS).
Stötter et al281 reported results of a single-center RCT
from Germany comparing RFA with PIN stripping or
cryostripping, with 20 patients in each of the 3 groups. At
1 year, RFA showed significantly better results in QOL and
pain assessment, and the authors found significant superiority regarding return to routine activity and work.
Hinchcliffe et al282 reported the results of a singlecenter trial comparing RFA with open surgery in 16 patients with bilateral recurrent GSV varicose veins after
previous bilateral high ligation without stripping. One leg
chosen at random was treated with RFA, the other with
stripping, and both sides had phlebectomies. The time
required to perform RFA was significantly shorter (25 vs 40
minutes), and pain and bruise scores were significantly
lower for RFA than for stripping. Follow-up was 1 year.
The authors concluded that RFA is the technique of choice
to treat the incompetent GSV.

Endovenous thermal ablations (laser and radiofrequency ablations) are safe and
effective, and we recommend them for treatment of saphenous
incompetence.
Because of reduced convalescence and less pain and morbidity, we recommend
endovenous thermal ablation of the incompetent saphen
