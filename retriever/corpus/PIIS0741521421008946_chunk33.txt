EA, more than 25 emboli in 10 minutes after
unclamping were detected in 216 patients (54%).
Following initiation of dextran 40, embolization ceased
in all cases and there were no strokes or acute carotid
thromboses in these patients.141 Another review reported
a 46% decrease in emboli when dextran was administered during CEA.142
Previous work demonstrated increased platelet activation during CEA. In a study of 38 CEA patients who
were taking aspirin and who received heparin intraoperatively, P-selectin binding index was assessed as a measure of platelet activation. P-selectin levels rose after
incision, during carotid clamping, after clamp release,
and at 1 hour and 24 hours postoperatively. Likewise,
TCD revealed an increase in embolic signals compared
with the rate of preoperative signals during the dissection, after clamp release, and during recovery. Six patients who had greater than 50 high intensity signals
per 30 minutes received dextran 40 and a signiﬁcant
reduction in P-selectin levels (P < .05) was noted after
dextran therapy in these patients.143 These ﬁndings indicate that platelet aggregation occurs during CEA despite
conventional antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and heparin administration, and that it may be ameliorated with
dextran 40.144 Recent work suggested that dextran may
exert a combined therapeutic effect by enhancing
endogenous ﬁbrinolysis as well as reducing platelet
adhesion to von Willebrand factor and platelet activation
by thrombin.145
Although these observations make a compelling case
for the efﬁcacy of dextran use among patients undergoing CEA, objective clinical beneﬁt has not been
deﬁnitively demonstrated. Further, in a recent review
of the Vascular Study Group of New England, including
89 surgeons and 66641 CEA procedures performed
from 2003 to 2020, intraoperative dextran administration did not decrease the rate of perioperative stroke,
but it was associated with an increased incidence of
