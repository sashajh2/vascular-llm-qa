 venous insuﬀciency. MRI, arterial Doppler
ultrasound, and CT scan are not typically used as initial diagnostic tests for chronic
venous disease.
2. A 40-year-old female presents with varicose veins that are causing discomfort. She has no
skin changes or ulcers. What is the most appropriate initial treatment for her condition?
A. Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA)
B. Sclerotherapy
C. Conservative therapy with compression stockings
D. High ligation and stripping of the great saphenous vein
Answer
C. Conservative therapy with compression stockings
Discussion: Conservative therapy with compression stockings is the initial treatment for
patients with symptomatic varicose veins without skin changes or ulcers. This approach
aims to relieve symptoms and may be suﬀcient for managing early-stage disease. EVLA,
sclerotherapy, and surgical interventions like high ligation and stripping are considered
for more advanced cases or when conservative measures fail.
3. A patient with chronic venous insuﬀciency (CVI) presents with a venous ulcer that
has failed to heal with conservative measures. What is the next appropriate step in
management?
A. Initiate high-dose oral antibiotics
B. Perform surgical ligation of perforator veins
C. Consider endovenous ablation of refuxing superficial veins
D. Apply topical corticosteroids
Answer
C. Consider endovenous ablation of refuxing superficial veins.
Discussion: For patients with chronic venous insuﬀciency (CVI) and non-healing venous
ulcers, consideration should be given to endovenous ablation of refuxing superficial veins

to reduce venous hypertension and promote ulcer healing. High-dose antibiotics, surgical
ligation of perforator veins, and topical corticosteroids are not primary treatments for
CVI-related ulcers.
4. A patient with chronic venous disease (CVD) is evaluated using the CEAP classification
system and scored as C4b. What does this classification indicate??
A. Active venous ulcer
B. Skin pigmentation or eczema
C. Lipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche
D. Telangiectasias or reticular veins
Answer
C. Lipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche.
