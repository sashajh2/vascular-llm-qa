Previous studies have made the distinction in size
threshold for repair of visceral artery aneurysms on the
basis of whether the aneurysm is a true aneurysm or a
pseudoaneurysm.205 This is based on the fact that pseudoaneurysms are at higher risk of rupture and should
therefore be repaired regardless of size. However, it is
known that many of the PDAAs and GDAAs that have
ruptured can be small and <10 mm.206 In fact, a singlecenter review of all visceral aneurysms found that PDAAs
were strongly associated with rupture (P < .0002).207
Thus, GDAAs and PDAAs should be repaired regardless
of size and regardless of true vs false aneurysm in patients who have acceptable operative or interventional
risk.117,208-213
A Markov model decision analysis was performed to
assess the effectiveness of preventive treatment of patients with PDAA based on risk.214 The authors argued
that whereas 60% of PDAAs present ruptured regardless
of size, the natural history of unruptured aneurysms
cannot be determined by that of ruptured aneurysms.

Assuming a mortality rate of 21% after rupture, they
found that preventive treatment was dominated by no
treatment if mortality rates of preventive treatment
were >1.4%, >2.6%, >3.8%, and >4.8% at annual rupture
rates of 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%, respectively, for an 80-yearold patient. Preventive treatment was dominated by no
treatment if mortality rates of preventive treatment
were >3.3%, >5.9%, >8.0%, and >9.7% at annual rupture
rates of 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%, respectively, for a 50-year-old
patient.
