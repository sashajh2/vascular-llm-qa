 stenosis of 70% or greater is a
peak systolic velocity (PSV) of 275 cm/s or more, whereas
200 cm/s or more indicates a similar stenosis of the CA
with no ﬂow in either vessel consistent with an occlusion.
These criteria for the SMA were associated with a sensitivity of 92%, speciﬁcity of 96%, positive predictive value
(PPV) of 80%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of
99% with an overall accuracy of 96%.49,50 Importantly, a
negative study essentially rules out a signiﬁcant stenosis
of the SMA. These peak systolic criteria for the CA are
associated with a sensitivity of 87%, speciﬁcity of 80%,
NPV of 63%, PPV of 94%, and an overall accuracy of
82%. Alternatively, an EDV of 45 cm/s or more corresponded with a 50% or greater stenosis of the SMA
with a 90% sensitivity, 91% speciﬁcity, 90% PPV, 91%
NPV, and 91% accuracy.51 An EDV of greater than
55 cm/s in the CA corresponded with a 50% or greater
stenosis with an accuracy of 95%, sensitivity of 93%, and
speciﬁcity of 94%; reversal of ﬂow in the hepatic arteries
was predictive of a proximal CA stenosis or occlusion.51
The use of postprandial DUS imaging has not been
shown to improve the overall accuracy for the evaluation
of either SMA or CA stenoses.21,52
The reported DUS criteria used to determine the degree of stenosis in the SMA and CA may vary by vascular
laboratory and the speciﬁc imaging equipment, underscoring the importance of local validation. In a more
recent study by AbuRahma and colleagues,53 the most
accurate determination of a 50% or greater SMA stenosis
was a fasting PSV of 295 or higher (accuracy 88%, NPV
84%, PPV
