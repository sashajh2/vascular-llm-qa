aphenous vein in patients undergoing
ligation and stripping.13,28 In a case-control study
performed in three European centers, 36 patients were
treated with two compression stockings with a thigh
pad and 17 with two stockings alone. By postoperative
day 3, there was signiﬁcantly reduced pain measured
by a visual analogue scale (VAS) in the group receiving
both the stockings and the pad compared with the
group receiving only the stockings (31 vs 19; P ¼ .05).
The physical domain score of the 12-Item Short Form
Health Survey quality of life questionnaire also demonstrated better results in the stockings and pad group,
whereas overall pain was reduced by 49% compared
with stockings alone. There were no differences in
adverse events. In the second study investigating the
use of eccentric pads after saphenous stripping procedures, 54 patients were randomized to three different
groups: group 1, compression stockings only (23-32 mm
Hg at ankle); group 2, adhesive bandages (Porelast and
Panelast; L&R, Rengsdorf, Germany); and group 3,
compression stockings and an eccentric pad on the
thigh GSV site. All devices were worn for 7 days. Outcomes included pressures achieved (supine and standing, day 1 and day 7), major adverse events at day 7
(VAS pain score >6, extensive hematoma, bleeding
through bandage, superﬁcial venous thrombosis, or
DVT), minor adverse events by day 7 (VAS score 3-5,
discomfort, skin irritation, clot in stripping canal), and

duplex ultrasound at day 7. Higher pressures were
obtained in group 2 vs group 1 and in group 3 vs groups
1 and 2. There were more major adverse events in group 1
and more minor events (skin irritation) in group 3. No
superﬁcial venous thrombosis or DVT occurred in any
patient. The authors concluded that higher pressures
were better, although the pad had to be taped in place
and caused more skin irritation.13
