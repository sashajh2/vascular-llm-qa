should include documentation of the clinical class of
the chronic venous disorder. The panel recommends using the recently updated 2020 CEAP classiﬁcation system and reporting standards as a good practice
statement (Table II).15 Each clinical class (C0-C6) can be
further characterized with a subscript letter, according to
the presence or absence of symptoms (S, symptomatic;
A, asymptomatic; eg, C2A or C2S). Symptoms include
aching, pain, tightness, skin irritation, heaviness, muscle
cramps, and other complaints attributable to venous
dysfunction.31 The basic CEAP classiﬁcation can be used
for clinical practice, and the full CEAP classiﬁcation system should be used for clinical research. For patients
with C2 disease (varicose veins), the most recent CEAP
clinical classiﬁcation requires a different diagnostic and
treatment strategy for recurrent varicose veins. Thus,
such patients should now be identiﬁed with the
subscript “r” for recurrence (ie, C2r).15
Guideline 2. High ligation and surgical stripping vs
endovenous ablation
Guideline 2.1.
2.1.1. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the GSV or SSV who are candidates
for intervention, we recommend superﬁcial venous
intervention over long-term compression stockings.

Level of recommendation: grade 1 (strong), quality of
evidence: B (moderate)
2.1.2. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the AAGSV or PAGSV who are candidates for intervention, we suggest superﬁcial venous
intervention over compression stockings.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak), quality of
evidence: C (low to very low)
2.1.3. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the superﬁcial truncal veins, we suggest compression therapy for primary treatment if the
patient’s ambulatory status and underlying medical
conditions warrant a conservative approach, or if the
