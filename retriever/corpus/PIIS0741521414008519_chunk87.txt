 cytokines, bacterial counts, and
pain.271 In an RCT of 337 VLU patients, weekly treatment
with high-frequency ultrasound did not result in an increase in healing rates or improved quality of life compared
with standard VLU care.272 Unfortunately, most therapeutic ultrasound protocols have recommended treatment sessions at higher frequency, such is three times weekly or
once daily. This has led to criticism of this trial as suffering
from inadequate ultrasound dosing to determine whether
it provides any beneﬁt to patients with VLUs. Additional
studies employing a standardized protocol of therapeutic
ultrasound in patients with VLUs are required for further
recommendations on the use of this modality to be
made.273 On the basis of current literature, there is insufﬁcient evidence to recommend the routine use of therapeutic ultrasound for the treatment of VLUs as a primary
therapy.

On the basis of the literature review, there are three
adjuvant treatments with evidence suggestive of beneﬁt
for patients with VLUs that do not respond to an initial
treatment course of standard therapy. Split-thickness skin
grafting may provide beneﬁt, particularly for large, recalcitrant VLUs. Cellular therapy with Apligraf was found to be
beneﬁcial in a multicenter randomized clinical trial, as was
porcine small intestinal submucosa. There have been no
comparative trials of these therapies published with sufﬁcient evidence to recommend one therapy over the others
for the treatment of recalcitrant VLUs.

because of limitations in current evidence. Use of confusing
terminology and not reporting the dose (pressure) of a
compression device and physical properties of the compression product are just a few of many deﬁciencies in available
evidence related to compression therapy.275 The use of
pressure-measuring devices at the skin-bandage interface
to ensure adequate pressure applied during the bandaging
is not routine; however, in speciﬁc circumstances (such as
study protocol and quality assurance), such instruments
can be applied.276,277
