infrequent presentation, repair is generally recommended at a smaller diameter.
Some controversy exists regarding treatment strategies for patients who present with an AAA between
4.0 and 5.4 cm. In the UKSAT274 and the ADAM trial,275
the 30-day operative mortality in the immediate
surgery groups (5.5% UKSAT, 2.1% ADAM) led to an
early disadvantage in survival. The investigators found
no statistically signiﬁcant difference in long-term
survival between the immediate OSR and surveillance
groups. Currently, nearly 80% of all AAAs are treated
by EVAR in the United States.276,277 Given the less invasive nature of EVAR, two studies re-evaluated the
appropriateness of intervention for small aneurysms.
The Comparison of Surveillance versus Aortic Endografting for Small Aneurysm Repair (CAESAR)278 and
Positive Impact of Endovascular Options for Treating
Aneurysms Early (PIVOTAL)279 trials compared immediate EVAR with surveillance for AAAs between 4.1 and
5.4 cm (CAESAR) and 4.0 and 5.0 cm (PIVOTAL) and
found no survival beneﬁt for early EVAR, but neither
trial was designed to determine whether immediate
EVAR might be beneﬁcial or harmful for speciﬁc AAA
size ranges or age subgroups. A Cochrane database
