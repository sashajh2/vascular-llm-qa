restenosis or thrombosis were observed. Angiographic
stenosis decreased from 82.9 6 9.1% (range, 61%-97%) to
19.3 6 7.3% (range, 0%-34%) (P < .05).401
The CGuard CARENET (Carotid Embolic Protection Using MicroNet) trial included 30 consecutive patients
from four centers in Germany and Poland. The 30-day
major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular event risk was
0%. New silent ipsilateral ischemic lesions on diffusionweighted MRI at 48 hours occurred in 37.0% of patients.
Thirty-day diffusion-weighted MRI showed complete resolution of all but one periprocedural lesion and only one
new minor lesion in relation to the 48-hour scan.402 In
contrast, in patients at high risk for CEA, data from the
SCAFFOLD trial showed a low risk of major adverse
events at 30 days as well as a low risk of ipsilateral stroke
from 31 days to 1 year with the Gore carotid stent (W. L.
Gore & Associates). The trial enrolled 312 patients, but
only 265 were included in the primary analysis. Thirtyday mortality risk was 0.6% (out of 265) and 30-day stroke
risk was 2.9% in the entire cohort. The two deaths reported in the study were not stroke related.

Number of carotid stents. The number of stents used
are associated with risk of perioperative stroke, and this is
likely a surrogate for the length of the lesion and difﬁculty
of the case. Data from the CAPTURE trial demonstrated a
higher 30-day stroke risk of 9.7% after the use of multiple
stents compared with 4.5% in patients with only one
stent.198 In a secondary analysis from the CREST study, lesions longer than 12.85 mm had a 3.4-fold higher risk of
stroke and death in CAS compared with CEA.17
