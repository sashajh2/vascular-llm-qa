 synovial,280,281 or Baker cyst282 or
venous leiomyosarcoma.283 In these patients further
evaluation with computed tomography or magnetic
resonance imaging is warranted. When the saphenous
aneurysm is near the femoral or popliteal vein, open
surgical excision is indicated, with ligation or oversewing
of a dilated proximal saphenous stump. In patients with
symptomatic saphenous reﬂux, endovenous ablation,
tumescent anesthesia aided phlebectomy or limited
stripping of the distal segment is performed. If the
aneurysm is located >3 cm distal to the SFJ or SPJ,
permitting safe proximal occlusion with endovenous
techniques, endovenous ablation alone is frequently
possible and safe, although most large (>3 cm) or
symptomatic, thrombosed aneurysms are better treated
with surgical excision at any location. There is also signiﬁcant risk of sural nerve injury, when thermal ablation is
used to treat proximal SSV aneurysm. Ablation of
saphenous aneurysms within 3 cm. of the SFJ and SPJ
should not be treated with UGFS due to the increased
risk of propagation of larger amount of foam into the
deep venous system.
Evidence. Similar to deep vein aneurysms,284-286
there is evidence that saphenous vein aneurysms
carry a risk of VTE.287-289 Treatment is recommended
whether or not there is thrombus in the aneurysm
sac. Conservative therapy with elastic compression for
small aneurysms and in those who are not candidates for intervention decreases the risk of thrombotic complications. Most reports describe open
surgical excision of saphenous aneurysms, with proximal and distal ligation or distal saphenous ablation.274,277,278,287-290 In two smaller series of mostly
small GSV aneurysms (<3 cm in size), located close to
the SFJ, endovenous ablation alone
