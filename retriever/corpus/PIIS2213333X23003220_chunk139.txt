endothermal heat
induced thrombosis [EHIT]) following thermal ablation
of the GSV as well as ready access to ultrasound in
most venous clinics, screening for EHIT and DVT with
early DUS has become a common practice. EHIT is
commonly classiﬁed as thrombus extension to the AFJ
ort SPJ (I), involvement of <50% of the deep venous
lumen (II), involvement of >50% of the deep venous
lumen (III), or occlusive DVT (IV).233 As technology has
evolved over the last two decades, it has become clear
that junctional thrombus extension can occur after
nonthermal as well as thermal ablation. Accordingly,
we suggest that the term EHIT” be replaced by “ARTE.”
ARTE is an all-encompassing term that includes junctional extension associated with any ablation modality

including thermal, foam, mechanicochemical, and
cyanoacrylate ablation. This includes events previously
described as EHIT, postablation superﬁcial thrombus
extension, endovenous glue induced thrombosis, and
endovenous foam-induced thrombosis. To ensure consistency with previous reports, ARTE should be classiﬁed similar to EHIT (I-IV), although it must be
acknowledged that the clinical relevance of ARTE I and
likely even ARTE II is minimal. In the following discussion, the preferred terminology “ARTE” will be used
whenever possible, although the term “EHIT” will still
be used for studies speciﬁcally reporting this as an
outcome.
Previous guidelines from the AVF and SVS have suggested that venous duplex examination be performed
withing 1 week of the index procedure as an ungraded
best practice recommendation.233 The European Society
for Vascular Surgery has similarly considered ultrasound
surveillance after treatment of a saphenous trunk as a
consensus recommendation.56 However, despite this
guidance, most evidence suggests that the incidence
