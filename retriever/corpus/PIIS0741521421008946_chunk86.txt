claims to have better hemostatic properties. Similarly, a
new ultrathin Dacron graft patch was introduced to
minimize thrombosis (Finesse; Boston Scientiﬁc, Natick,
Mass). AbuRahma et al259,260 reported the results of a
randomized trial comparing conventional PTFE and
conventional collagen-impregnated Hemashield in CEA.
Perioperative stroke risk was 0% for PTFE vs 7% for
Dacron graft (P ¼ .02). There were ﬁve cases of perioperative carotid thrombosis in the Dacron group vs none
in the PTFE group, and restenosis risk was also higher in
patients with Dacron graft (P # .001). However, PTFE had
longer intraoperative needle hole bleeding time. Subsequently, AbuRahma et al265 reported the results of randomized trial of 200 CEA patients, 100 ACUSEAL vs 100
Finesse Dacron patching, in which the perioperative
stroke risk (2%) and stroke-free survival rate were comparable for both patches. However, freedom from 70% or
greater restenosis at 1, 2, and 3 years for ACUSEAL was
98%, 96%, and 89% vs 92%, 85%, and 79%, respectively,
for the Finesse patch (P ¼ .04).
Satisfactory outcomes were also reported using pericardial patching after CEA by Biasi et al.307 Stone et al308 reported results of prospective randomized trial of
ACUSEAL vs Vascu-Guard patching in 200 CEA and
they concluded that there was no signiﬁcant differences
in perioperative/late neurologic events and late restenosis in the two groups.
Oldenburg et al309 reported on durability of CEA with a
bovine pericardial patch in a retrospective analysis of 874
consecutive patients who underwent CEA at the Mayo
Clinic in Florida. A bovine
