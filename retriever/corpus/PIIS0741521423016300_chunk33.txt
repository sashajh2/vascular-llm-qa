 predict healing or amputation outcomes; however, TP (as a component of TBI) has been more widely
investigated and is therefore included in the
recommendation.
The predictive capacity of APs and ABI for wound healing was inconsistent in the 15 studies included in the systematic review.5 Thresholds for AP and ABI which were
associated with increased probability of healing could
not be identiﬁed; however, a very low ankle pressure
(e.g., < 50 mmHg) or ABI (e.g., < 0.5) was associated
with a greater likelihood of delayed healing. According
to current guidelines revascularisation should be considered when such values are measured in people with PAD
and an ulcer or gangrene.20 AP and ABI values > 50
mmHg or > 0.5, respectively, should not be used in isolation to predict likelihood of ulcer healing given their uncertainty, but detailed clinical examination and further
vascular testing is needed, as stated in Recommendation
6. Regarding amputation risk, the probability of major
amputation was increased by approximately 45% with
an ABI < 0.4 based on one study in people who had undergone transmetatarsal amputation. However, an ABI
threshold < 0.9 was not associated with any probability
increase.5,67 Thresholds used for AP were highly variable
in the literature and it was not possible to determine
which threshold was optimal.5 Other research has
demonstrated that an elevated ABI (> 1.3) is associated

with both greater likelihood of amputation and worse
amputation free survival outcomes and therefore should
be recognised as a risk factor for poor DFU outcomes.
The same observations were made in people without
diabetes, and an elevated ABI is therefore seen as a
marker for more severe cardiovascular disease with an
elevated risk of amputation.68,69
TP and TBI can assess blood ﬂow distal to the forefoot
and in toes, where most DFUs occur.70 Based on 10
studies of low quality it was found that with TP $ 30
mmHg the pre-test probability of healing was
increased by up to
