4.1.4. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the GSV or SSV, we recommend
treatment with HL&S of the saphenous vein if technology or expertise in endovenous ablation is not available or if the venous anatomy precludes endovenous
treatment.

Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)
4.1.5. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the AAGSV or PAGSV, we suggest
treatment with ligation and stripping of the accessory
saphenous vein, with additional phlebectomy, if
needed, if technology or expertise in endovenous ablations is not available or if the venous anatomy precludes endovenous treatment.

4.1.6. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the GSV who place a high priority
on the long-term outcomes of treatment (QOL and
recurrence), we suggest treatment with EVLA, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or HL&S over physiciancompounded UGFS, because of long-term improvement of QOL and reduced recurrence.

4.1.7. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the SSV we suggest treatment
with EVLA, RFA, or ligation and stripping from the
knee to the upper or midcalf over physiciancompounded UGFS, because of long-term improvement of QOL and reduced recurrence.
