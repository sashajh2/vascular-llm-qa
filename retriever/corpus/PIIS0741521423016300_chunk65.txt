 As many people with
a DFU and PAD also have atherosclerotic disease in other
vascular beds, tight glucose control can be harmful. The
risk of hypoglycaemia is markedly lower when people are
only treated with metformin, a sodium glucose
cotransporter-2 inhibitor or a glucagon like peptide 1
receptor agonist. Tight glucose control is often not indicated in people with PAD and a DFU due to the risk of
hypoglycaemia outweighing the potential beneﬁt. The
ADA recommends in the 2022 Standards of Care to aim
for an HbA1c < 8% (< 64 mmol/mol) in such persons and
the ESC-EASD 2019 guideline for levels below 8 e 9%
(< 64 e 75 mmol/l).18,129 However, the target chosen will
depend on factors such as age, duration of diabetes,
complications, co-morbidities, and risk of hypoglycaemia. These target HbA1c levels are higher than the
level formulated in the GVG for CLTI (< 7.0%, 53 mmol/
mol), but as discussed above it is concluded that the risk
of such tight blood glucose control is too high in this
speciﬁc population.
Blood pressure goals. The ESC-EASD guidelines state
that RCTs have demonstrated the beneﬁt (reduction of
stroke, coronary events, and kidney disease) of lowering
systolic BP to < 140 mmHg and diastolic BP to < 90
mmHg.18 Usually, multiple drugs are necessary to reach
these levels in people with diabetes. In younger people
(e.g., younger than 65 years) levels below 130/80 mmHg
can be considered if there are no contraindications for
such tight blood pressure control and the risk of orthostatic hypotension is low. Both the ADA and ESC-EASD

stress the importance of individualised treatment as
overly aggressive blood pressure lowering is not without
risk in the usually elderly with a DFU and those
