122,495 Medicare patients undergoing elective AAA
repair between 2001 and 2008 noted that the mortality
for OSR is directly related to medical center volume.367

The OR for elective perioperative mortality was lowest for
centers that perform at least 18 open repairs and
was <5%.367
Accurate assessment of open surgical expertise and the
applicability of outcome data acquired in the preendovascular era will be areas of concern as the volume
of OSR continues to decline in the United States with
anticipated reduction in the prevalence of cigarette
smoking and expanding options for complex EVAR.
Care should be taken in extrapolating current outcomes
for OSR from data obtained before the widespread availability of endovascular devices.
We suggest that elective OSR for AAA be performed at centers
with an annual volume of at least 10 open aortic operations
of any type and a documented perioperative mortality of 5%
or less.

The patient with a ruptured aneurysm
Preoperative management and considerations for
patient transfer. A ruptured AAA represents a true surgical emergency. Documented rupture, particularly with
associated hypotension, demands immediate transfer
to an adequately equipped operating room for deﬁnitive
repair without delay. Should aneurysm rupture occur,
more than half of patients die before hospitalization or
without treatment.
Establishing a protocol or algorithm for urgent or emergent management of a patient with a ruptured AAA is
essential for optimizing outcomes.443 In the presence of
a protocol, 30-day mortality was 18%, whereas in the
absence of a protocol, 30-day mortality was 32%.444-446
Based on review of the literature, including existing
guidelines endorsed in the United Kingdom447 and by
the Western Vascular Society, an algorithm for the initial
evaluation, diagnosis, immediate management, and
triage of patients with a suspected ruptured AAA is presented (Fig 5). An expedited evaluation consisting of the
