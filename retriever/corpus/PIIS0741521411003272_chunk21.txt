Bicuspid venous valves are important structures assisting unidirectional flow in the normal venous system. The
GSV usually has at least 6 valves (range, 4-25), with a
constant valve present within 2 to 3 cm of the SFJ in 85% of
cases,67 and the SSV has a median of 7 to 10 valves (range,
4-13).68 There are valves in the deep veins of the lower
limb, but the common femoral or external iliac vein has
only one valve in about 63% of cases.68 In 37%, there is no
valve in the common femoral or external iliac veins. The
internal iliac vein has a valve in 10%; its tributaries have
valves in 9%.69

Patients with varicose veins may present with no symptoms at all; the varices are then of cosmetic concern only,
with an underlying psychologic impact. Psychologic concerns related to the cosmetic appearance of varicose veins
will, however, reduce a patient’s QOL in many cases.
Symptoms related to varicose veins or more advanced
CVD include tingling, aching, burning, pain, muscle
cramps, swelling, sensations of throbbing or heaviness,
itching skin, restless legs, leg tiredness, and fatigue.70 Although not pathognomonic, these symptoms suggest
CVD, particularly if they are exacerbated by heat or dependency noted during the course of the day and relieved by
resting or elevating the legs or by wearing elastic stockings
or bandages.51 Pain during and after exercise that is relieved
with rest and leg elevation (venous claudication) can also be
caused by venous outflow obstruction caused by previous
DVT or by narrowing or obstruction of the common iliac
veins (May-Thurner syndrome).69-71 Diffuse pain is more
frequently associated with axial venous reflux, whereas poor
venous circulation in bulging varicose veins usually causes
local pain.
History. A thorough medical history is essential in the
patient’s evaluation and may establish the diagnosis of
primary, secondary, or congenital varicosities. Questions
to patients who present with varicose veins should address
