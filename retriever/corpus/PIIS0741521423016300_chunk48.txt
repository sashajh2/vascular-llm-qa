vere ischaemia is deﬁned in the GVG as an ABI <
0.4, AP pressure < 50 mmHg, TP < 30 mmHg or
TcPO2 < 30 mmHg or monophasic or absent pedal
Doppler waveforms.20,84 Such perfusion deﬁcits are,
as also stated in the GVG, an indication for revascularisation, unless contraindicated or technically not
possible. There is retrospective evidence demonstrating that a delay in revascularisation of more than
two weeks in people with diabetes results in increased
risk of limb loss.102 This is supported by observational
research demonstrating that a shorter time to revascularisation (< 8 weeks) is associated with a higher probability of DFU healing and lower likelihood of limb
loss.74 As shorter time to revascularisation was associated with higher probability of DFU healing and lower
likelihood of limb loss, a Best Practice Statement supporting urgent referral for vascular consultation in people with DFU and evidence of severe ischaemia was
made (Fig. 1).

Rationale
In the presence of PAD and infection or gangrene, an
urgent revascularisation should be considered. In the
prospective Eurodiale study, participants with the combination of a foot infection and PAD had a one year major amputation rate as high as 44%.103 In addition,
participants with higher WIfI infection grade had higher
risk of amputation in several observational studies, as
summarised in the IWGDF systematic review on Classiﬁcation Systems (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1
002/dmrr.3645).38 Delay in treatment can lead to rapid
tissue destruction and life threatening sepsis as
described in the IWGDF/IDSA Guidelines on Management of Diabetic Foot Infections.104 In a person with a
foot abscess or infection of a deep foot compartment
that needs immediate drainage, or where there is
gangrene that must be removed to control the infection,
immediate surgery should be considered ﬁrst.104 This
should be accompanied by broad spectrum antibiotic
therapy, which is subsequently tailored according to tissue culture results, as “time is tissue” in these people.
Once the se
