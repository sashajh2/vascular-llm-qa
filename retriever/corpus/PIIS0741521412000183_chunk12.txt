idence of residual venous obstruction. Although the iliac
segments frequently lack valves, persistent proximal venous
obstruction may be potentially associated with the development of reflux in more caudal segments that were not
initially thrombosed.28
Not surprisingly, iliofemoral venous thrombosis is associated with severe hemodynamic derangements that may
be persistent.29 Acutely, iliofemoral thrombosis may compromise the primary venous outflow from the limb with
more severe pain and swelling as well as phlegmasia cerulea
dolens.30 It is also associated with long-term outcomes
such as venous claudication and more severe manifestations
of the postthrombotic syndrome. Venous claudication has
been reported in as many as 43.6% of patients a median of 5
years after iliofemoral DVT.29 Perhaps more importantly,
initial involvement of the common femoral or iliac veins is
associated with a greater increase in objective (Villalta)
postthrombotic scores.8 Although the importance of recurrent venous thrombosis is well recognized as a powerful
determinant of the postthrombotic syndrome,7,31,32 involvement of the iliofemoral venous segment is associated
with at least as great a mean change in Villalta score (⫹2.23;
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-3.16) as a previous
ipsilateral DVT (⫹1.78; 95% CI, 0.69-2.87).8 Finally, patients with extensive iliofemoral venous thrombosis have a
greater than twofold increased risk of recurrent VTE compared with those with femoropopliteal thrombosis.6
Because involvement of the iliofemoral venous segments is associated with worse outcomes, the most proximal extent of thrombus should be clearly defined in the
clinical management of patients as well as in research
studies and clinical trials. Routine use of the term proximal venous thrombosis should be discouraged in favor
of more precise characterization of these thrombi as
involving the iliofemoral or femoropopliteal venous
segments
