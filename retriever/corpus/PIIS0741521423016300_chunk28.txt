of the affected limb and foot, but when DFU is present
further diagnostic procedures should be performed with
non-invasive bedside testing techniques as clinical examination is not sufﬁcient to exclude PAD. Although of
limited value it should not be discarded as in the early
phase of management other tests are sometimes unavailable, or ﬁndings may be difﬁcult to interpret. The evidence
base is small with low certainty but as previously discussed
this form of testing has low resource requirements, can be
applied on a broad scale by a range of practitioners, is
feasible, and may increase equity of healthcare access.
This Strong Recommendation is therefore made, based
on low certainty of evidence and expert opinion. However,
a systematic foot examination for signs of ischaemia
should be the starting point of a systematic evaluation,
as failure to diagnose and treat this condition may have
dire consequences in many people. When DFU is present
further diagnostic testing using bedside testing techniques in the ﬁrst instance should be performed as palpation of foot pulses and clinical examination alone are not
sufﬁcient to exclude PAD.
The systematic review identiﬁed eight studies56e63 of
diagnostic accuracy of bedside testing that included participants with active DFU, with the proportion of the study
population affected ranging from 6.6% to 100%.56,57 One
study demonstrated a visual pedal Doppler waveform
evaluation to be diagnostic (PLR $ 10), with a moderate
ability of the test to exclude PAD. In a second study
with z 40% of the participants having a foot ulcer, the
PLR was lower (3.04) and the NLR similar (0.35).61 In studies
in which the majority of the study population had DFU, an
ABI < 0.90 increased the pre-test probability of disease by
a small amount (PLR 1.69 e 2.40) with limited ability of the
test to exclude disease (NLR 0.53 e 0.75).56,59,62,63 Similarly,
data for the TBI were limited and variable with the PLR in
both mixed populations (with and without DFU) and DFU
only, ranging from 1.62 (indicating limited ability to
