They are more common in men (95%)2,3 and tend to
occur in the sixth and seventh decades of life.1 Few modern studies have been performed on the natural history
of PAAs, and many of these were retrospective reviews
of surgical patients. As such, the timing and details of
PAA management remain nuanced.
The popliteal artery begins as the superﬁcial femoral artery emerges from the adductor hiatus. It courses behind
the knee enveloped in a sheath and surrounded by a fat
pad.4 The popliteal artery gives off genicular branches
that surround the knee, acting as important pathways
for collateral circulation, and divides into the anterior tibial
artery and the tibioperoneal trunk in the proximal calf.
The normal popliteal artery measures 5 to 9 mm in diameter and is generally larger in men by 1 to 2 mm.5-8 It is
generally considered aneurysmal when its diameter exceeds 15 mm or when it is 1.5 larger than its normal
diameter.1,9-11 Asymptomatic PAAs that are <20 mm in

diameter can be expected to have a growth rate of 0.3
to 1.5 mm annually.12-14 The rate of growth for aneurysms
>20 mm in diameter is variable from no
growth reported for most patients to #3 mm/y in
others.9,13,15 Independent factors associated with PAA
growth include the initial aneurysm diameter and the
presence of mural thrombus.16 A prospective analysis
showed that the initial PAA size inﬂuenced the rate of
subsequent growth. When stratiﬁed by the initial size,
PAAs <20 mm grew at 1.5 mm/y, PAAs 20 to 30 mm
grew 3 mm/y, and those >30 mm grew 3.7 mm/y. The
most recent retrospective analysis of 87 asymptomatic
PAAs demonstrated that smaller size aneurysms may
demonstrate a slower growth rate for a number of years
before an accelerated growth phase occurs,16 conﬁrming
previous observations that PAAs with greater diameters
will enlarge more rapidly than those with smaller diam
