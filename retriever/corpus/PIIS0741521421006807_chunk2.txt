severity of ALI at presentation. We recommend that patients with mild to moderate ALI (Rutherford grade I
and IIa) and severely obstructed tibiopedal arteries undergo thrombolysis or pharmacomechanical intervention to improve runoff status, with prompt transition
to deﬁnitive PAA repair. We recommend that patients
with severe ALI (Rutherford grade IIb) undergo prompt
surgical or endovascular PAA repair, with the use of

outﬂow. Nonviable limbs (Rutherford grade III) require
amputation. Level of recommendation: grade 1
(strong); quality of evidence: B (moderate)

EPAR should be followed up
