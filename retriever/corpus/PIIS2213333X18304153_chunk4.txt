preliminary review. This preliminary list was circulated
among the writing group members with relevant
expertise to identify any further relevant peer-reviewed
publications. Each publication included in the ﬁnal list
was reviewed and graded independently by three
writing group members.

Description of

Beneﬁt vs risk

Methodologic quality of
supporting evidence

Implications
Strong recommendation,
can apply to most patients
in most circumstances
without reservation

1A

Strong recommendation,
high-quality evidence

Beneﬁts clearly outweigh
risk and burdens, or vice
versa

RCTs without important
limitations or
overwhelming evidence
from observational studies

1B

Strong recommendation,
moderate quality
evidence

Beneﬁts clearly outweigh
risk and burdens, or vice
versa

Strong recommendation,
RCTs with important

limitations (inconsistent
in most circumstances
results, methodologic
without reservation
ﬂaws, indirect, or
imprecise) or exceptionally
strong evidence from
observational studies

1C

Strong recommendation,
low-quality or very
low-quality evidence

Beneﬁts clearly outweigh
risk and burdens, or vice
versa

Observational studies
or case series

2A

Weak recommendation,
high-quality evidence

Beneﬁts closely balanced
with risks and burdens

RCTs without important
Weak recommendation,
limitations or overwhelming
best action may differ
evidence from observational
depending on
studies
circumstances or patients’
or societal values

2B

Weak recommendation,
moderate-quality
evidence

Beneﬁts closely balanced
with risks and burdens

Weak recommendation,
RCTs with important
best action may differ
limitations (inconsistent

2C

Weak recommendation,
low-quality or very
low-quality evidence

Uncertainty in the estimates
of beneﬁts and risk, and
burdens; risk, beneﬁt, and
burdens may be closely
balanced
