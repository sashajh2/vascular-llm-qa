 therapy
for VLUs, with most studies reporting on mixed wound
causes.264 There has been an increase in the use of negative
pressure wound therapy for wound bed preparation to
augment skin graft healing.265
Guideline 4.25: Electrical Stimulation
We suggest against electrical stimulation therapy
for venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
There is theoretical, preclinical, and limited clinical evidence to support the use of electrical stimulation for the
treatment of VLUs.266 However, few studies of electrical
stimulation focus solely on VLUs. Also, there is little consistency in the parameters of treatment, including variability in type of electrical current, settings, treatment
times, and preferred waveforms, making comparisons
impossible.267,268 For these reasons, electrical stimulation
is not recommended for the treatment of VLUs until
further evidence supports its use.
Guideline 4.26: Ultrasound Therapy
We suggest against routine ultrasound therapy for
venous leg ulceration. [GRADE -2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Therapeutic ultrasound has been found to stimulate a
number of cellular effects associated with the acceleration
of wound healing. These cellular effects have been well
studied in vitro and include improvement of microcirculation, reduction of edema, and increases in cytokine and
other protein levels that are active in the healing
cascade.269 Clinical trials studying the effects of ultrasound
have reported positive results in the healing of a variety of
chronic nonhealing wounds.270 Clinical trials of therapeutic ultrasound for the healing of VLUs lack standardized
protocols, and relatively few studies focus on VLUs alone.
In a pilot study of VLUs refractory to compression therapy,
ultrasound treatment was associated with a decrease in
wound size, inï¬‚ammatory cytokines, bacterial counts, and
pain.271 In an RCT of 337 VLU patients, weekly treatment
with high-frequency ultrasound did not result in an increase in healing rates or improved quality of life compared
with standard VLU care.272 Unfortunately, most therapeutic ultrasound protocols have recommended treatment sessions at higher frequency, such is three times weekly or
once daily. This has led to criticism of this trial as suffering
from inadequate ultrasound dosing to determine
