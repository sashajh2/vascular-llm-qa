Although it might be feasible, routine treatment of IPVs
in patients with C2 disease does not have a
documented beneﬁt

Probably yes

Is the option feasible to implement?

CAC, Cyanoacrylate closure.

Judgment

How substantial are the desirable anticipated
effects of the strategy?

Important advantages exist to treating all
lower extremity varicose veins in one setting

Moderate

How substantial are the undesirable
anticipated effects?

Likely, a small increase in postoperative pain;
50%-70% of patients would not need
subsequent phlebectomy due to symptom
relief after saphenous vein ablation

Moderate

Do the desirable effects outweigh the
undesirable effects?

For some patients, the desirable effects would
outweigh the undesirable effects; when CT
was compared to ablation only, multivariate
analysis revealed a signiﬁcant reduction in
VCSSs for the CT vs UT groups (P ¼ .002)

Probably yes

Is there important uncertainty or variability
about how much people value the main
outcomes?

Short-term results conﬁrmed that
concomitant phlebectomy prolonged the
ablation procedure but reduced the need
for secondary procedures and signiﬁcantly
improved QoL; 5-year results of same RCT
showed excellent and similar clinical results
and QoL scores in both groups; however,
concomitant treatment was associated with
optimal improvement in both QoL and
severity of clinical disease; although both
strategies are acceptable, concomitant
procedures (CT) were more often chosen by
the patient

Probably not
important
uncertainty or
variability

What is the overall certainty of the evidence
of effects?

Low

How large are the resource requirements
associated with the intervention?

One study showed CT procedure time was
signiﬁcantly longer than that for UT alone
