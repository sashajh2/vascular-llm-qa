 a comprehensive review in 2011 by AbuRahma
et al,252 and review of the recent literature has not identiﬁed a predominant technique to predict adequate
cerebral perfusion.253-255
Summary and recommendations. We suggest judicious use of cerebral monitoring based on practitioner
expertise and institutional standards, particularly if no
routine shunting is used.
Shunting: routine versus selective
Based on the current literature, the use of shunting during CEA has not evolved. For many years, use of arterial
shunts was considered in three broad categories: Always,
never, or selective use with multiple alternatives available
to provide temporary ﬂow during periods of carotid
clamping. These were mainly based on the preference
and training of the operating surgeon. AbuRahma
et al252 conducted a comprehensive review of available
approaches to cerebral monitoring and intraoperative
shunting methods and found no discernible advantage
with any technique. Since then, large series have also
failed to report deﬁnitive differences in outcomes with
any particular strategy.255-258 In the most recent reported
