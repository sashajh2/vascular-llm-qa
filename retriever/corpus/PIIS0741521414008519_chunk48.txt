 veins from patients with CVD, with the important
ﬁnding that overall collagen is increased and both elastin
and laminin are decreased.85 When the collagen was
examined in smooth muscle from varicose veins, the
consistent ﬁnding was that there was a signiﬁcant
decrease of collagen type III and increased type I, and
the same biochemical proﬁle was also observed in the
dermal ﬁbroblasts from varicose vein patients.85,86 These
ﬁndings indicate a systemic condition with strong genetic
inﬂuences, and because collagen I confers rigidity
whereas collagen III is involved in the extensibility of a
tissue, modiﬁcation of the collagen I/III ratio might
contribute to the weakness and the decreased elasticity
of varicose veins. Interestingly, the transcription of
collagen III is normal in smooth muscle cells from varicose veins and the activity of MMP-3 is increased, leading
to post-translational modiﬁcation of collagen type III;
these events are reversible when MMP-3 is inhibited
in vitro.87 MMPs are an important step in the development of primary venous disease; their implications are
in early events affecting endotheliumesmooth muscle interactions and venodilation as well as in late events, with
extracellular matrix degradation, structural vein wall
changes and ﬁbrosis, and tissue damage leading to venous
ulceration.

Venous microvalves have recently been identiﬁed
both in control specimens and in patients with
CVD.88 The interesting aspect of that study is a system
of sequentially smaller generations of tributaries leading
to small venous networks, with competent and incompetent microvalves. The regions are divided into six generations before reaching the small venous network. In
regions where incompetence existed in microvalves out
to the third-generation tributary (the boundary), the
resin (resin injected by retrograde corrosion casting)
was able to penetrate deeper into the microvenous networks of the dermis. In limbs with varicose veins and
venous ulcers, reﬂux into the small venous networks
and capillary loops was more extensive with more dense
