ABSTRACT
The Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines on popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs) leverage the work of a
panel of experts chosen by the Society for Vascular Surgery to review the current world literature as it applies to PAAs to
extract the most salient, evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of these patients. These guidelines focus on
PAA screening, indications for intervention, choice of repair strategy, management of asymptomatic and symptomatic
PAAs (including those presenting with acute limb ischemia), and follow-up of both untreated and treated PAAs. They offer
long-awaited evidence-based recommendations for physicians taking care of these patients. (J Vasc Surg 2022;75:109S-20S.)
Keywords: Acute limb ischemia; Guidelines; Popliteal artery aneurysms; Thrombolysis

SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
1. We recommend that patients who present with a
PAA are screened for both a contralateral PAA and
an AAA. Level of recommendation: grade 1 (strong);
quality of evidence: B (moderate)
2. We recommend that patients with an asymptomatic PAA $20 mm in diameter should undergo
repair to reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications and limb loss. Level of recommendation:
grade 1 (strong); quality of evidence: B (moderate).
For selected patients at higher clinical risk, repair
can be deferred until the PAA has become
$30 mm,
