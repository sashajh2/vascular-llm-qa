HAA before the adequate treatment of endocarditis
with antibiotics was widespread.153 Aneurysm rupture
is reported with a wide range of 14%150 to 80%,159
but given the retrospective nature of these studies,
the true risk of rupture is unknown. Nonatherosclerotic
aneurysms, however, are at signiﬁcantly higher risk of
rupture as they often present as multiple aneurysms.150,153-159

3.1

We recommend an endovascular-ﬁrst approach to all HAAs if it is anatomically
feasible (ie, if this approach maintains arterial circulation to the liver).

A (High)

3.2

In patients with extrahepatic aneurysms, we recommend open and endovascular
techniques to maintain liver circulation.

A (High)

3.3

In patients with intrahepatic aneurysms, we recommend coil embolization of the
affected artery (Grade 1B). In patients with large intrahepatic HAA, we recommend
resection of the involved lobe of liver to avoid signiﬁcant liver necrosis (Grade 1C).

aneurysms suggest that the majority of these lesions
rupture when they are >2 cm in diameter.93 In one series,
when patients were observed nonoperatively for
68 months, only 27% of patients showed enlargement of
the aneurysm without any complication.150 Given these
ﬁndings, Abbas et al150 recommended careful observation for aneurysms <5 cm among high-risk patients and
repair for lesions >2 cm only among low-risk patients
unless these aneurysms enlarge or become symptomatic. Given the signiﬁcant high rate of morbidity and
mortality after HAA rupture (30% mortality rate in one
series150) and overall low rate of morbidity and mortality
after elective HAA repair (0% mortality in the same series150), the current recommendation is for
