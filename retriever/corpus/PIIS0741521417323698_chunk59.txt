 material greatly increase the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of CT imaging.200 With modern
equipment and imaging techniques, false-positive CT
interpretation is low,201 and radiographic ﬁndings of
rupture are well characterized.202
We recommend using ultrasound, when feasible, as the
preferred imaging modality for aneurysm screening and
surveillance.

We suggest that the maximum aneurysm diameter derived
from CT imaging should be based on an outer wall to outer
wall measurement perpendicular to the path of the aorta.

Prediction of aneurysm expansion and rupture risk.
A signiﬁcant unmet need in the assessment of AAA
disease is a determination of rupture risk. Maximum
AAA diameter remains the most widely used and
validated criterion for prediction of rupture risk. The
adoption of maximum diameter as a measure of rupture
risk was based, in part, on a retrospective review of
24,000 consecutive autopsies performed during 23 years
at a single institution.203 Of the 473 nonresected AAAs
identiﬁed in this series, 118 were ruptured. Approximately
40% of AAAs >5 cm in diameter were ruptured. However,
40% of AAAs between 7 and 10 cm were not ruptured,

whereas 13% of AAAs <5 cm were ruptured.203 Thus, a
variety of potentially more sensitive predictors of rupture
risk have been proposed, including AAA expansion
rate,58,66,204,205 wall stiffness,206-208 wall tension,209 and
peak AAA wall stress.210-212
Hall and colleagues have suggested that rupture is
imminent above a critical aortic wall stress, predicted
by the law of Laplace and maximum AAA diameter.209
Several other investigators subsequently demonstrated
that wall stress is highly dependent on AAA shape rather
than diameter alone.210-216 With ultrasound-based
