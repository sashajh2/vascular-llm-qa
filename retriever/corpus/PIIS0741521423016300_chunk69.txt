 to aspirin in
reducing recurrent ischaemic events in those with diabetes.135 The relative risk reduction was comparable with
those without diabetes, but due to the greater number
of events among people with diabetes, the absolute risk
reduction was even larger. Given the potential beneﬁt, it
is suggested in a Conditional Recommendation that
clopidogrel should be considered as ﬁrst choice, in line
with the aforementioned guidelines.
As an additional alternative to single antiplatelet therapy, combination therapy with aspirin (100 mg once
daily) plus low dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily)
should be considered for those with low bleeding risk
to prevent cardiovascular events as well as reduce extremity ischaemic events in those with CLTI, as suggested
by the GVG, ESVM, and ESC-EASD guidelines and the
2023 ADA Standards of Care.16,20,23,129 This suggestion is
based on the COMPASS trial in which this combination
therapy was more effective than aspirin but was also
associated with an increased risk of clinically relevant
bleeding, mostly gastrointestinal.136 In this trial approximately 38% had diabetes mellitus and the beneﬁt of
the combination therapy seemed similar in those with

and without diabetes. Given this limited evidence base
and the added treatment burden for this frequently
vulnerable cohort, a Best Practice Statement in line
with the ESVS and ADA recommendations was
made.129,137 It should be noted that in the COMPASS trial
in addition to a high bleeding risk of rivaroxaban, other
exclusion criteria included end stage renal disease, severe heart failure, recent stroke, history of haemorrhagic
or lacunar stroke, and poor life expectancy.138 A network
meta-analysis showed no superiority for aspirin with
rivaroxaban over clopidogrel alone for the primary composite endpoint in the chronic PAD subgroups of CAPRIE
and COMPASS.139 Therefore in the absence of a RCT
directly comparing the two, both clopidogrel alone and
aspirin with rivaroxaban are reasonable choices for secondary cardiovascular prevention for patients with
