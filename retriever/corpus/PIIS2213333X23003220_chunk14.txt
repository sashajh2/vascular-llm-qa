7.1.2

For patients with symptomatic telangiectasias or reticular veins, we suggest
transcutaneous laser treatment if the patient has sclerosant allergy, needle phobia,
sclerotherapy ,failure or small veins (<1 mm) with telangiectatic matting.

7.1. Telangiectasias and reticular veins

7.2. Varicose tributaries

For treatment of symptomatic varicose tributaries, we recommend miniphlebectomy or
ultrasound guided sclerotherapy using physician-compounded foam (PCF) or polidocanol
endovenous microfoam (PEM).

7.2.2. For treatment of symptomatic varicose tributaries, we suggest transilluminated powered 2 (weak)
phlebectomy as an alternative treatment for patients with clusters of varicosities by a
physician who is trained in the procedure.

Consensus statements
7.2.3.

For patients with symptomatic varicose tributaries, treatment of the tributaries should be performed, even if the superﬁcial
trunks are competent.

7.2.4. There is no clinical evidence that FS using room air is less safe and effective than using CO2 gas mixture.
7.2.5.

There is currently no clinical study of sclerotherapy with PCF, prepared using the Tessari method, that shows that it is less safe
or effective than PEM.
8. Treatment of varicose tributaries concomitant or staged with superﬁcial truncal ablation

8.1.1.

For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the GSV or SSV and associated varicosities, we
recommend ablation of the reﬂuxing venous trunk and concomitant phlebectomy or
ultrasound- guided FS of the varicosities with PCF or PEM.
