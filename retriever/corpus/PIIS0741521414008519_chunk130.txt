0 to 40 mm Hg compression hose, either
knee or thigh high. Two large RCTs support the use of
compression to decrease the occurrence of PTS.197,517,518
Overall, a reduction of w50% was observed. Lesser
compression strength, such as 20 to 30 mm Hg, is not as
effective.519 Multilayer compression is effective only for
symptoms and not for development of PTS.520 The duration of compression for efﬁcacy has not been rigorously
determined by prospective studies.521 However, per the
current American College of Chest Physicians 2012 guidelines, use of compression stockings immediately after

diagnosis of DVT and continued compression for at least
6 months to 2 years are supported.522 A large recent
RCT calls this into question, but for now, we believe the
harms for this therapy are low.523
Use of IPC may be helpful to relieve PTS symptoms,
but its role in preventing VLU is unknown.524,525 Use of
IPC should be based on individual assessments as little evidence exists. A small randomized crossover trial in patients
with PTS found that compared with placebo-level pressure,
IPC with a level of compression of 50 mm Hg was associated with a signiﬁcant improvement in symptoms.524 However, the hard end point of VLU prevention was not
assessed. Two other groups of patients who may beneﬁt
from IPC are those with severe difﬁculty in donning standard compression stockings and those who are immobile.526,527 Here, studies focusing on the physiology of
decreased venous pressure and reduced interstitial edema
suggest beneﬁt for the latter group.
Guideline 8.3: Primary PreventiondAcute DVT
Treatment
As post-thrombotic syndrome is a common preceding event for venous leg ulcers, we recommend current
evidence-based therapies for acute DVT treatment.
[GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B] We suggest
use of low-molecular-weight heparin over vitamin K
antagonist therapy of 3-month duration to decrease
post-thrombotic syndrome. [
