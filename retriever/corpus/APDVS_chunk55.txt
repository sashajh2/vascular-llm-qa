Pre/Post Questions
Case Based Questions
1. A 70-year-old male, who has a history of heavy smoking (100 pack years), presents to
the clinic for claudication-like symptoms. What level of infrainguinal arterial occlusive
disease is he most at risk for developing based on this history?
A. Superficial femoral artery disease.
B. Deep femoral artery disease.
C. Anterior tibial artery disease.
D. Popliteal artery disease.
E. Posterior tibial artery disease.
Answer
A. Superficial femoral artery disease.
Discussion: The prevalence of peripheral artery disease in the general population is be-

89

tween 3-10%, and 15-20% in those over the age of 70. Risk factors for peripheral arterial
disease (PAD) include age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia,
family history and homocysteinemia. Heavy smokers have a propensity to develop superficial femoral artery disease (A). Patients with a history of diabetes have a tendency
to develop infrapopliteal disease (C, E). Patients of nonwhite ethnicity and those with a
history of chronic renal insuï¬€ciency are also at increased risk.
2. A 67-year-old female is being evaluated in the outpatient clinic for lower extremity pain
associated with walking. Using a manual blood pressure cuff and hand-held Doppler, the
following measurements are obtained:
