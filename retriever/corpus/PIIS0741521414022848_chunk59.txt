 suggestion
of disease in the donor iliofemoral system by pulse examination, hemodynamic assessments, or axial imaging. Formal
evaluation of the aortic arch vessels is not generally required
for AxFB unless there is a discrepancy in brachial pressures
or another reason to suspect brachiocephalic disease.
For FFB, the donor iliac system must be free of hemodynamically signiﬁcant disease, or such diseasedif present and
of a localized naturedcorrected by endovascular means
with conﬁrmed elimination of any translesional pressure gradients (<5 mm Hg mean pressure resting) before performing
the bypass.184 Interrogation and treatment of both donor
and recipient CFAs, as noted above, is imperative to optimize
long-term outcomes. The graft is placed in a deep subcutaneous, extrafascial tunnel across the suprapubic region of the
lower abdomen. Dacron and ePTFE conduits have equal
and acceptable results. Autogenous and cryopreserved grafts
may be used for FFB in settings of infection. Care must be
taken in regard to the lie of the graft in relation to the lower
abdomen, particularly where there is a signiﬁcant pannus. A
gentle upside down “U” conﬁguration is used, placing the
heel of the anastomosis at the mid to distal CFA level to avoid
kinking when standing upright. Mortality (<2%) and
morbidity (10%) after FFB are generally low. Long-term outcomes are quite acceptable, with patency rates in the 55% to
80% range out to 5 years,175 although signiﬁcantly inferior
to in-line reconstructions. Primary factors affecting patency
are the status of the outﬂow vessels (ie, presence of severe disease in the SFA or DFA on the recipient side) and progression
or recurrence of disease in the donor iliac system.176,185
AxFB is uncommonly used in the setting of claudication.
