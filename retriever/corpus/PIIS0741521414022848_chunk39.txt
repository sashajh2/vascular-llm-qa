patients will develop symptoms of advanced ischemia, such
as ischemic rest pain and tissue loss, or will ultimately
require amputation.9,122 The relatively benign natural history of claudication must be weighed against the effect of
the loss of ambulatory function on activities of daily living,
occupation, and QoL. Consequently, the decision to intervene should be individualized, taking into consideration
these factors as well as the clinical response to noninterventional therapies, and weighing the potential risks against
the expected functional beneﬁts for the patient. This initial
consideration of candidacy is largely independent of technical factors, such as the anatomy of the occlusive lesions
or the type of procedure, either endovascular or surgical,
that would be required. Although most patients with IC
who adhere to risk factor modiﬁcation and conservative
management decline slowly or generally maintain their current level of function, a signiﬁcant minority (20%-30%) will
develop increased disability over time that warrants intervention. Interventions for claudication are done to improve
function in the setting of signiﬁcant ongoing disability in an
active person. In this context, it is important to recognize
that some patients seek treatment based solely on the fear
that IC will inexorably lead to amputation. Reassurance
about the expected natural history of claudication to alleviate their anxiety may be all that is required in such patients and should always predate a discussion of invasive
treatment. Performing prophylactic interventions in patients with IC that is minimally symptomatic or well tolerated has no beneﬁt, may cause harm, and is never indicated.
It is also important to recognize that the degree of
disability in claudication correlates relatively poorly with both
physiologic testing and anatomic ﬁndings. It has been well
established that the resting ABI, for example, is a modest predictor of the degree of walking impairment by self-reported
symptoms or objective testing.123,124 Similarly the burden of
disease by anatomic imaging correlates poorly with function
in everyday life. This may relate to nonvascular causes of

walking impairment, the adaptation of each individual to the
disability, and the variable contributions of collaterals. Justiﬁcation for interventions for IC is not based primarily on physiologic (eg, ABI) measures or on anatomic �
