8.1.3. For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the GSV
or SSV, we suggest ablation of the reﬂuxing venous
trunk and staged phlebectomy or UGFS of the varicosities only if anatomical or medical reasons are present.
We suggest shared decision-making with the patient
regarding timing of the procedure.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
8.1.4. For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the
AAGSV or PAGSV, we suggest ablation of the reﬂuxing
venous trunk and staged phlebectomy or UGFS of the
varicosities only if anatomical or medical reasons present. We suggest shared decision-making with the patient regarding timing of the procedure.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
8.2. For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the major
superﬁcial venous trunks and associated varicosities
undergoing initial ablation alone, we recommend
follow-up for $3 months to assess the need for staged
phlebectomy or ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy for
persistent or recurrent symptoms. Longer follow-up is
recommended for those with recurrence or more
advanced CEAP class.
Good clinical practice statement. For Rationale and
Evidence supporting Guidelines 8.1.1. to 8.1.4. and Good
Clinical Practice statement 6.2, please see Part I of the
varicose vein guidelines.8 The panel strongly recommended concomitant procedures to treat truncal
incompetence and varicose veins at the same settings,
since most patients would like to have a single operation,
but the evidence supporting the efﬁcacy of a concomitant procedure had to be downgraded to C (low to very
low), because the meta-analysis by Aherne et al214
included 12 nonrandomized studies with the intrinsic
associated bias. A subanalysis of three RCTs showed no
difference in reinterventions between the groups. In
addition, 63.9% of the patients with planned staged
intervention never had a second procedure. The study
counted the second operation of a
