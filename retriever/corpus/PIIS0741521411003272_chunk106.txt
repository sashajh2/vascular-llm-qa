 the higher the likelihood of
hyperpigmentation, a minor complication that can be observed in up to 30% of the cases.320 Between 70% and 95%
of the pigmentations, however, resolve by 1 year after
therapy.317
The incidence of major neurologic events after foam
injection is rare; instances of stroke were reported by Bush
et al321 and others.319,322,323 Immediate treatment with
100% oxygen and possibly hyperbaric oxygen therapy
should be considered. Factors implicated in the risk of stroke
after foam sclerotherapy include the use of air instead of
carbon dioxide to prepare the foam, large bubble size, a patent
foramen ovale, failure to elevate the limb after treatment,
prolonged immobility after therapy, and an excessive amount
of foam used during one session.319,322-324 Standardization
of the bubble size using commercially prepared microfoam and the replacement of air with carbon dioxide in
the solution may decrease the risk of neurologic
complications.325
A recent study Regan et al326 proposed that the composition and properties of the foam, including bubble size
and gaseous components, may indeed contribute to the
potential for microcirculatory obstruction and cerebral
ischemia. The authors tested an ultralow nitrogen polidocanol endovenous microfoam with controlled bubble size
and density and found that patients treated with foamed
liquid sclerosants are commonly exposed to cerebrovascular gas bubbles. In a series of 60 high-risk patients with

middle cerebral artery bubble emboli during or after treatment, however, there was no evidence of cerebral or cardiac
microinfarction.
Although rare, allergic reactions and anaphylaxis after injection of a sclerosing solution can occur, and it is
essential to have an emergency protocol, resuscitation
equipment, oxygen, and drugs (diphenhydramine, epinephrine, cimetidine, steroids) available to prevent a
major catastrophe.
Guex et al296 reported early and midterm complications in a prospective multicenter registry that included
12,173 sclerotherapy sessions, consisting of 5434
