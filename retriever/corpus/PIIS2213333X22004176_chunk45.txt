Rationale and evidence. This recommendation applies
only to physician-compounded UGFS when using it for
ablation of a superﬁcial truncal vein and does not
address the value of UGFS in the management of tributary varicosities. The recommendation is based largely on
evidence of a higher rate of recurrent varicosity, higher
risk of recurrent intervention, lower rate of occlusion of
the treated truncal vein, and lower disease-speciﬁc QoL
at 5 years after UGFS compared with high ligation and
saphenous stripping or thermal ablation.7,8,10 Diseasespeciﬁc QoL at 5 years was also better for both high
ligation and saphenous stripping (RR, 2.60; 95%
CI, 3.99 to 1.22; P < .001) and EVLA (RR, 2.86; 95%
CI, 4.49 to 1.22; P < .001) than for UGFS.10 Data on the
long-term effectiveness of commercial PEM are not yet
available, although the results of one RCT100 and several
retrospective studies153-155 are encouraging.
Cost-effectiveness. High ligation and saphenous stripping, EVLA, and RFA are all effective treatment strategies
for symptomatic varicose veins arising from axial venous
reﬂux. However, both reimbursement and out-of-pocket
costs to the patient can vary signiﬁcantly, depending on
insurance authorization. The out-of-pocket costs could
be the most important consideration for many patients.36 Therefore, the treating physician must be aware
of the costs of the different treatment options and
counsel their patients accordingly.
Because cost-effectiveness will vary with the setting
and local reimbursement system, and most data on
cost have come from outside the United States, our supporting systematic review did not evaluate costeffectiveness. In British studies, physician-compounded
UGFS had had the lowest initial costs, although this
was partially offset by the long-term costs of reintervention and lower QoL.85,156 High l
