 (High)

We suggest renal artery or superior mesenteric artery
(SMA) angioplasty and stenting for selected patients
with symptomatic disease before EVAR or OSR.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

We suggest prophylactic treatment of an asymptomatic, high-grade stenosis of the SMA in the presence of
a meandering mesenteric artery based off of a large inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), which will be sacriﬁced during the course of treatment.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

We suggest preservation of accessory renal arteries at
the time of EVAR or OSR if the artery is 3 mm or larger
in diameter or supplies more than one-third of the renal
parenchyma.
Level of recommendation

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

Perioperative outcomes of elective EVAR. We suggest
that elective EVAR be performed at centers with a volume of at least 10 EVAR cases each year and a documented perioperative mortality and conversion rate to
OSR of 2% or less.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

Role of elective EVAR in the high-risk and unﬁt
patient. We suggest informing high-risk patients of their
VQI perioperative mortality risk score for them to make
an informed decision to proceed with aneurysm repair.
Level of recommendation

OSR. We recommend a retroperitoneal approach for
patients requiring OSR of an inﬂammatory aneurysm, a
horseshoe kidney, or an aortic aneurysm in the presence
of a hostile abdomen.

We suggest a retroperitoneal exposure or a transperitoneal approach with a transverse abdominal incision for
patients with signiﬁcant pulmonary disease requiring
OSR.

We recommend a thrombin inhibitor, such as bivalirudin or argatro
