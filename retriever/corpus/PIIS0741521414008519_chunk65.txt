 and wide dissemination of
CEAP for both clinical and research purposes, making
CEAP an essential component of venous disease classiﬁcation.
In an effort to improve standardized outcome assessment of venous disease with gradable elements that can
change in response to treatment, the Venous Clinical
Severity Score (VCSS) was introduced in 2000 and revised
in 2010 (Table VI). The VCSS system includes 10 clinical
descriptors (pain, varicose veins, venous edema, skin pigmentation, inﬂammation, induration, number of active ulcers,
duration of active ulceration, size of ulcer, and compressive
therapy use), scored from 0 to 3 (total possible score, 30),
that may be used to assess changes in response to therapy.
VCSS has been shown to have minimal intraobserver and
interobserver variability, and validation with objective venous
parameters has been shown in a few studies.187-192 The more
recent revised VCSS (rVCSS) should be determined on
initial evaluation and then at serial intervals for assessment
of clinical outcome after nonoperative and operative treatment of VLUs and has been shown to be a better tool for
assessing response to treatement.192,193 VCSS $8 indicates
a patient with severe disease at risk for progression and warrants additional diagnostics or treatment.194
