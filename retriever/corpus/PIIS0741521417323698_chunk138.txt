.394,683,684 Nonsupported limbs are at especially
high risk of limb occlusion.685 However, stented limbs
may also occlude by fabric infolding and kinking between stents.683,686 Whereas the causes of endograft
limb occlusion may be related to a number of factors,
one of the most common reasons is compromised
outﬂow. Occlusion of the internal iliac artery with or
without extension of the endograft limb to the external
iliac artery or unrecognized distal dissection may
increase the risk of limb thrombosis.687,688 Acute endograft limb occlusion often is manifested with worsening
claudication rather than with critical ischemia, provided
the limb has been deployed proximal to the internal iliac

A stenotic limb, noted on duplex ultrasound or by a
reduction in ABI, can be treated by stent placement. An
occluded limb after EVAR or open repair can be treated
by thrombectomy, pharmacolytic therapy with secondary endovascular or local surgical intervention, or
femoral-femoral or axillofemoral bypass. Mechanical
balloon thrombectomy is less likely to be successful for
treatment of an endograft limb thrombosis because of
difﬁculty in advancing the catheter beyond the occluded
segment, concerns related to dislodging or disrupting the
sealing zones, and the presence of stents, which may
interfere with balloon thrombectomy. The underlying
cause of the thrombosis must be identiﬁed and treated,
and if a mechanical cause for thrombosis cannot be
determined, femoral-femoral bypass should be considered. Simple thrombectomy or thrombolysis will often
lead to recurrent early thrombosis. Five-year patency for
a femoral-femoral bypass graft, when it is placed in the
treatment of aneurysmal disease, exceeds 80%.689,690
