or active VLUs. Essentially all studies demonstrate durable
results in patient with VLUs that have proved recalcitrant
to healing with other forms of treatment.363,391-393,397-399
Among these are comparable studies performed independently by experienced venous reconstructive surgeons who
report a consistent range of successful results with longterm follow-up at 1, 5, and 7 years.363,376,378
Guideline 6.12: Deep Venous Reﬂux With Skin
Changes at Risk for Venous Leg Ulcer (C4b), Healed
(C5) or Active (C6) Venous Leg UlcerdValve Transposition or Transplantation
In a patient with infrainguinal deep venous reﬂux
and skin changes at risk for venous leg ulcer (C4b),
healed venous leg ulcer (C5), or active venous leg ulcer
(C6), we suggest valve transposition or transplantation
for those with absence of structurally preserved axial
deep venous valves when competent outﬂow venous
pathways are anatomically appropriate for surgical
anastomosis in addition to standard compression therapy to aid in venous leg ulcer healing and to prevent
recurrence. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Venous valve transposition requires that a competent
valve, or one that can be made competent, be placed above
the site where the incompetent venous systems are
implanted into the axial vein. One example would be the
presence of a competent valve in the proximal deep femoral
vein, below which the incompetent femoral vein can be
implanted to result in a then competent femoral venous
system. In the select cohort of patients who are amenable
to this intervention, a 40% to
