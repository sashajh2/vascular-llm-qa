Guideline 6.15: Proximal Chronic Venous Occlusion/Severe Stenosis (Bilateral) With Recalcitrant Venous
UlcerdOpen Repair
In a patient with inferior vena cava or iliac vein chronic occlusion or severe stenosis, with or without lower extremity deep venous reﬂux disease, that is associated with a recalcitrant venous leg ulcer and failed endovascular
treatment, we suggest open surgical bypass with use of an externally supported expanded polytetraﬂuoroethylene
graft in addition to standard compression therapy to aid in venous leg ulcer healing and to prevent recurrence.

Guideline 6.16: Unilateral Iliofemoral Venous Occlusion/Severe Stenosis With Recalcitrant Venous Ulcerd
Open Repair
In a patient with unilateral iliofemoral venous occlusion/severe stenosis with recalcitrant venous leg ulcer for
whom attempts at endovascular reconstruction have failed, we suggest open surgical bypass with use of saphenous
vein as a cross-pubic bypass (Palma procedure) to aid in venous ulcer healing and to prevent recurrence. A synthetic
graft is an alternative in the absence of autogenous tissue. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]

Guideline 6.17: Proximal Chronic Total Venous Occlusion/Severe Stenosis (Bilateral or Unilateral) With
Recalcitrant Venous UlcerdAdjunctive Arteriovenous Fistula
For those patients who would beneﬁt from an open venous bypass, we suggest the addition of an adjunctive
arteriovenous ﬁstula (4-6 mm in size) as an adjunct to improve inﬂow into autologous or prosthetic crossover bypasses when the inﬂow is judged to be poor to aid in venous leg ulcer healing and to prevent recurrence. [GRADE 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
