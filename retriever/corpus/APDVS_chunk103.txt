 and has absent pedal and popliteal doppler signals.
What is the first step in management of this patient?
A. Emergent open surgical embolectomy with bypass
B. Catheter based thrombolysis
C. Percutaneous fogarty thrombectomy
D. Start a therapeutic heparin drip
Answer
D. Start a therapeutic heparin drip.
Discussion: The first step in treatment of acute limb ischemia before any intervention
is considered or initiated is systemic anticoagulation with heparin or a direct thrombin
inhibitor in the case of a heparin allergy. In fact, if there is a high suspicion for ALI with
no Heparin may even be started during the diagnostic work-up if there is a high clinical
suspicion of ALI.

Introduction
Acute Limb Ischemia (ALI) is a vascular emergency characterized by a sudden
decrease in limb arterial perfusion. (Creager, Kaufman, and Conte 2012) Without timely
operative revascularization, it can lead to limb loss and death.
Recent data indicates an incidence of approximately 1.5 cases per 10,000 people annually, with
a 9% 30-day mortality rate and a 12.7% 30-day amputation rate despite early revascularization.
(Olinic et al. 2019)
ALI is commonly caused by arterial embolism or thrombosis, with risk factors including
smoking, diabetes, age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history of vascular disease, and
obesity. (Sidawy and Perler 2023a) (Smith and Lilie 2024a)
Clinical manifestations vary based on the affected artery and collateral blood vessels, with
the 6 Pâ€™s (pain, pulselessness, pallor, poikilothermia, paresthesias, and paralysis)
serving as diagnostic indicators. These symptoms make sense. If you have no fow, there will
be no pulse. With no pulse, there will be no red blood (pallor) or warm blood (poikliothermia)
in the affected limb. Lack of blood fow causes ischemia leading to pain, nerve ischemia/death
(paraesthesia), and eventual paralysis. Review a pictogram of the 6
