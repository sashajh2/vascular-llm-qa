 further impact the beneﬁt of medical
therapy. Additionally, analysis of current medical therapy
will be better understood vs carotid intervention once
several currently ongoing randomized trials (eg, CREST2,
SPACE2) are completed. Similarly, with the introduction
of transcarotid artery revascularization,114 the role of
CAS in treating both symptomatic/asymptomatic patients would need to be clariﬁed over the long-term.
Other larger studies regarding the timing of carotid intervention after acute stroke will be very beneﬁcial.
