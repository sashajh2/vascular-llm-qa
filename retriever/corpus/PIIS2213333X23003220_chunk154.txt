 prophylaxis reduced the incidence of DVT to 0.73% (95% CI,
0.52%-1.02%) from 1.31% (1.15%-1.48%) for mechanical
prophylaxis alone (compression stockings/bandages).
No signiﬁcant difference was noted between singledose and extended pharmacoprophylaxis. There were
no signiﬁcant differences in PE (0.14%, 0.07%-0.28% vs
0.16%, 0.15%-0.18%) or EHIT III to IV (0.35%, 0.09%-1.40%
vs 0.88%, 0.28%-2.70%) in comparing pharmacoprophylaxis to mechanical prophylaxis alone. Major bleeding
was quite rare (1 case) while minor bleeding was
observed in 0% to 10% of patients. Risk of bias was estimated to be high, and the Quality of Evidence was moderate among randomized trials and very low among
nonrandomized trials.
A systematic review included in the AVF/SVS EHIT
guidelines, which included only retrospective observational studies, failed to show a lower incidence of EHIT
with pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.233
11.2.2. For patients undergoing endovenous ablation
routine risk stratiﬁcation should be performed to assess
the need for periprocedural thromboprophylaxis.
Consensus statement.
Rationale and evidence. The literature reﬂects great
uncertainty regarding the value of risk assessment in
determining the need for thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing superﬁcial venous interventions.32
Deﬁning the risk factors for DVT/EHIT after saphenous
ablation is unfortunately difﬁcult due to the very low
number of events and limited statistical power. Although
inconsistent across studies, suggested risk factors for
EHIT/DVT have included age, male gender, CEAP class,
personal or family history of VTE, known thrombophilia,
reduced mobility, obesity, hormone therapy, active cancer, concomitant procedures including sclerotherapy
and microphlebectomy, large GSV diameter, and a history of
