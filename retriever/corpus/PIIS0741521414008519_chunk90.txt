A recent Cochrane review identiﬁed three RCTs
encompassing a total of 177 patients comparing compression dressings with primary dressing alone (never with
compression).279 One study (44 patients) showed a difference with improved ulcer area and volume at 8 weeks.280
Two of the studies (49 and 84 patients) failed to show a
difference in healing rates between treatments at 7 weeks
and 6 months of follow-up, respectively.281,282
Another RCT of 321 patients compared SSB or 4LB
with moist wound dressings without compression. The
healing rate at 24 weeks was superior in both compression
groups (72% SSB and 67% 4LB) compared with the noncompression group (29%; P < .0001).283
Three of four additional RCTs that compared
compression dressings with standard wound care found
improvement in ulcer healing with compression therapy.
One study (53 patients) compared SSB with usual care
and found complete ulcer healing at 3 months to be 71%
in the SSB group compared with 25% in the usual care
group (P value not reported).284 The remaining studies
compared 4LB dressing with primary care management.
A trial of 36 patients found more complete healing at 3
months in the compression group compared with the usual
care group (RR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.35-11.82).285 Similar

results were found in a larger trial encompassing 200 participants, with 54% of patients healed in the 4LB group
compared with 34% in the control group (P < .001).286
Another RCT of 233 patients failed to ﬁnd a difference between two groups with regard to complete healing at 1
year but did ﬁnd improved rate of healing (median time
of 20 vs 43 weeks; P
