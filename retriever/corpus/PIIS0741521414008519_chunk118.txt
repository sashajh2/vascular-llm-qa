Guideline 6.16: Unilateral Iliofemoral Venous
Occlusion/Severe Stenosis With Recalcitrant Venous
UlcerdOpen Repair
In a patient with unilateral iliofemoral venous occlusion/severe stenosis with recalcitrant venous leg ulcer for whom attempts at endovascular reconstruction
have failed, we suggest open surgical bypass with use
of saphenous vein as a cross-pubic bypass (Palma procedure) to aid in venous ulcer healing and to prevent
recurrence. A synthetic graft is an alternative in the
absence of autogenous tissue. [GRADE - 2
