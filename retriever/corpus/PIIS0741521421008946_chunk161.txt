 not well-established.
By contrast, intervention is reserved for symptomatic
patients with recurrent neurologic symptoms whose
symptoms have not responded to antithrombotic therapy after acute carotid dissection. Although open surgical repair with saphenous vein interposition graft is the
therapy of choice, it is associated with increased risk of
perioperative cerebrovascular events and CNI.492
With recent advances in endovascular technology,
percutaneous therapy with stent placement has become
increasingly common. The indications for stent placement are poorly deﬁned. Failure or contraindications to
medical therapy is the most common reason for endovascular management. In a retrospective review of 53 patients who underwent endovascular treatment for
symptomatic traumatic carotid dissection, risk of postoperative symptoms, luminal narrowing, and asymptomatic stent occlusion were 6.4%, 2.1% and 2.0%,
respectively.493 Although there are no studies comparing
open vs endovascular repair, endovascular treatment of
patients who failed medical management seems to be
justiﬁed.

TREATMENT OF PROXIMAL VERTEBRAL ARTERY
DISEASE
Proximal vertebral artery disease (V1 segment) is a less
common cause of cerebrovascular pathology than internal carotid stenosis, but atherosclerosis of the vertebral
artery may occur in up to 30% of patients presenting
with TIA or stroke.494-498 In addition, these patients may
have concomitant ICA disease. Less common etiologies
include dissection, trauma, ﬁbromuscular dysplasia,
Takayasu’s disease, spinous bony compression, aneurysms, and arteritis. Patients with vertebral-basilar TIAs
with a diseased vertebral artery have a 5-year stroke risk
of 22% to 35%.495,499-501 In addition, patients with posterior circulation strokes have higher mortality (20%-30%)
than patients with anterior circulation strokes.502-504
The proximal vertebral artery origin (V1 segment) is the
most common site of atherosclerotic stenosis (2
