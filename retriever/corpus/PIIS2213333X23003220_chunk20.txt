.1.1.

Grade of
recommendation

For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks and tributaries above the knee >3 cm 1 (strong)
from the SFJ and >5 cm in length, whether associated with varicose veins or not, we
recommend fondaparinux 2.5 mg subcutaneously daily for 45 days. Alternatively,
rivaroxaban 10 mg/d for 45 days may be appropriate for patients unwilling or unable to
perform subcutaneous injections.

Consensus statement
12.1.2.

For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks #3 cm from the SFJ, treatment with full anticoagulation for a minimum
of 6 weeks should be continued.

Guidelines
12.1.3.

Grade of
recommendation

For patients with SVT of the main saphenous trunks we recommend against using
1 (strong)
prophylactic or therapeutic dose low-molecular weight heparin and nonsteroid antiinﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Although both have been found to reduce SVT pain and
extension, they have failed to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE). If NSAIDs are used
for treatment of short segment distal SVT, surveillance with DUS for VTE extension is
recommended due to the high prevalence of concomitant DVT.

involvement of the GSV, we suggest phlebectomy as a safe alternative.

Consensus statement

In patients with saphenous thrombophlebitis, ablation should be performed once the inﬂammation has resolved if there is
evidence of pathologic reﬂux on DUS.
