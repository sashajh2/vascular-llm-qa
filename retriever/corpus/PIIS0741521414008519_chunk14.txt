 a venous leg ulcer (C6) and incompetent superﬁcial veins that have reﬂux to the ulcer bed in
addition to pathologic perforating veins (outward ﬂow of >500 ms duration, with a diameter of >3.5 mm) located
beneath or associated with the ulcer bed, we suggest ablation of both the incompetent superﬁcial veins and
perforator veins in addition to standard compressive therapy to aid in ulcer healing and to prevent recurrence.

Guideline 6.6: Combined Superﬁcial and Perforator Venous Reﬂux With or Without Deep Venous Disease and
Skin Changes at Risk for Venous Leg Ulcer (C4b) or Healed Venous Ulcer (C5)
In a patient with skin changes at risk for venous leg ulcer (C4b) or healed venous ulcer (C5) and incompetent
superﬁcial veins that have reﬂux to the ulcer bed in addition to pathologic perforating veins (outward ﬂow of >500
ms duration, with a diameter of >3.5 mm) located beneath or associated with the healed ulcer bed, we suggest ablation of the incompetent superﬁcial veins to prevent the development or recurrence of a venous leg ulcer. [GRADE 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C] Treatment of the incompetent perforating veins can be performed simultaneously
with correction of axial reﬂux or can be staged with re-evaluation of perforator veins for persistent incompetence
after correction of axial reﬂux. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 6.7: Pathologic Perforator Venous Reﬂux in the Absence of Superﬁcial Venous Disease, With or
Without Deep Venous Reﬂux, and a Healed or Active Venous Ulcer
In a patient with isolated pathologic perforator veins (outward ﬂow of >500 ms duration, with a diameter of
>3.5 mm) located beneath or associated with the healed (C5) or active ulcer (C6) bed regardless of the status of the
deep veins, we suggest ablation of the “pathologic” perforating veins in addition to standard compression therapy
to aid in venous ulcer healing and
