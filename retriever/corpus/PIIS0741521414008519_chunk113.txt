series of venous valve transplantation conducted in patients
with C3-6 disease, with most conducted in patients with
C5,6 disease. Multiple small case series are reported with
similar results for both techniques, with restored competence in the range of 40% to 60% for more than 2 years.
Anatomic variations determine which procedure can be
used in a given case. Both procedures can be effective for
short-term ulcer healing, but both are subject to late failure
of valve competence. A late failure of competence does not
necessarily result in recurrence of ulceration.
Guideline 6.13: Deep Venous Reﬂux With Skin
Changes at Risk for Venous Leg Ulcer (C4b), Healed
(C5) or Active (C6) Venous Leg UlcerdAutogenous
Valve Substitute
In a patient with infrainguinal deep venous reﬂux
and skin changes at risk for venous leg ulcer (C4b),
healed venous leg ulcer (C5), or active venous leg ulcer
(C6), we suggest consideration of autogenous valve
substitutes by surgeons experienced in these techniques
to facilitate ulcer healing and to prevent recurrence in
those with no other option available in addition to
standard compression therapy to aid in venous ulcer
healing and to prevent recurrence. [GRADE - 2;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Autogenous venous valve substitutes use venous tissue to
make a functioning venous valve with pieces of vein tissue or
endoluminal scar to fashion competent valves by various techniques. These include suturing of tissue in place within the
opened vein; invagination of the stump of the great saphenous
vein into the femoral vein with appropriate sutures placed to
act as a valve; use of tacking sutures to secure the anterior
