P ¼ .65) or major bleeding events (RR, 2.17; 95% CI, 0.1825.71; P ¼ .54). However, short-term combination therapy
was associated with a signiﬁcantly lower risk of major
vascular events (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.69-0.82; P < .01). Longterm, however, dual antiplatelet therapy did not decrease
the risk of stroke recurrence (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.83-1.03;
P ¼ .15), but it was associated with a signiﬁcantly higher
risk of hemorrhagic stroke (RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.10-2.56; P ¼
.02) and major bleeding events (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.46-2.48;
P < .01). Long-term combination therapy also failed to
reduce the risk of major vascular events (RR, 0.92; 95% CI,
0.84-1.03; P ¼ .09).137
Alternate antiplatelet agents are also being investigated for secondary prevention among patients with
symptomatic carotid disease. In a recent meta-analysis
of 36 randomized clinical trials, the efﬁcacy of conventional antiplatelet agents (aspirin; clopidogrel) was
compared with newer agents (cilostazol; triﬂusal). The
major ﬁnding was a trend indicating cilostazol was associated with reduced risk of recurrent stroke compared
with low-dose aspirin þ dipyridamole (OR, 0.75; 95% CI,
0.52-1.02) and clopidogrel (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.51-1.05),
but these differences were not statistically signiﬁcant.138
