years was 28% and 9.3%, respectively.7 Predictors of more
severe postthrombotic syndrome include involvement of
the common femoral or iliac veins, previous ipsilateral
thrombosis, higher body mass index, older age, and female
sex.8 Although the socioeconomic consequences of severe
postthrombotic syndrome are well recognized, even mild
postthrombotic symptoms may adversely affect quality of
life.9,10
Manifestations of the postthrombotic syndrome result
from a combination of valvular incompetence (reflux) and
residual venous obstruction.11,12 Several strategies for early
thrombus removal have been devised, offering the potential
for early restoration of venous patency and preservation of
valve function. Routine use of systemic thrombolysis for
acute DVT was discouraged by high rates of incomplete
thrombolysis and bleeding complications. For example, a
pooled analysis of six randomized trials found systemically
administered streptokinase was 3.7 times more likely than
heparin to produce “greater than minimal” thrombolysis,
although at the expense of a 2.9-fold increase in major
bleeding complications.13 However, more quantitative
analysis of thrombolytic outcomes has demonstrated complete thrombolysis in as few as 8.9% and no thrombus
reduction in as many as 33.8% of patients treated with
systemic tissue plasminogen activator.14 We recommend
against the use of non– catheter-directed, systemically administered thrombolytic agents for the treatment of iliofemoral thrombosis.
More directed strategies, including venous thrombectomy, catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis, and pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, may be more
efficient, with fewer bleeding complications, and likely
have a role in the treatment of acute DVT. Surgical
thrombectomy typically uses a catheter-mounted compliant balloon to remove thrombus from the iliac veins
via a groin incision combined with techniques to remove
associated distal thrombus. Adjunctive construction of a
temporary arteriovenous fistula is commonly recommended to reduce early rethrombosis.15
Catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis is an
