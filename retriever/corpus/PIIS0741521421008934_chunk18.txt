% and
an absolute risk reduction in stroke of 17% at 2 years
(26% in the medical arm vs 9% in the surgical arm) for
patients with >70% carotid stenosis. ECST demonstrated
a similar reduction in stroke risk after 3 years. The medical arm had a 26.5% stroke risk compared with 14.9% in
the surgical group, an absolute risk reduction of 11.6%.
In both studies, the risk of stroke in the medical arm
and, therefore, the beneﬁt of CEA, increased with an
increasing degree of stenosis. The results of these trials
established CEA as the treatment of choice for patients

with severe carotid stenosis and have been widely
accepted throughout the medical community. The
beneﬁt of CEA for those with stenosis of 50% to 69%
was more moderated15.7% rate of stroke after CEA vs
22.2% rate of stroke with medical therapy at 5 yearsdbut
the difference was still statistically signiﬁcant.4
CEA vs TF-CAS in symptomatic stenosis
A number of trials have examined the role of TF-CAS in
the management of neurologically symptomatic patients
with >50% diameter stenosis. Several early trials such as
SAPPHIRE (stenting and angioplasty with protection in
patients at high risk for endarterectomy) of high surgical
risk patients demonstrated overall equivalence of CAS
and CEA in the management of carotid stenosis, although
the number of symptomatic patients was too small for a
subgroup analysis.36 Two large prospective randomized
European trials, EVA-3S (endarterectomy vs angioplasty
in patients with symptomatic severe carotid stenosis)11
and SPACE1 (stent-supported percutaneous angioplasty
of the carotid artery vs endarterectomy),12 examined the
role of CAS vs CEA in neurologically symptomatic patients.
EVA-3S showed statistically inferior 30-day outcomes for
CAS compared with CEA. The 30-day incidence of any
stroke or death was 3.9% after CEA (95
