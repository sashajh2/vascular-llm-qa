INTRODUCTION
The management of extracranial cerebrovascular disease, including carotid endarterectomy (CEA), carotid
stenting and medical management is performed by
several specialists. Vascular surgeons perform a majority
of CEA, whereas catheter-based therapies (eg, carotid artery stenting [CAS]) are performed by vascular surgeons,
cardiologists, interventional radiologists, neurosurgeons,
interventional neurologists, and other professionals.1,2
Because multiple treatment modalities are available for
extracranial cerebrovascular disease, deﬁning optimal
therapy can be challenging particularly when different
specialtiesdoften with nonoverlapping expertised
deliver these therapeutic options.
In 2011, the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) published clinical practice guidelines for the management
of extracranial carotid artery disease in the Journal of
Vascular Surgery.3 A multispecialty document was also
published on the “Management of Patients with Extracranial Carotid and Vertebral Artery Disease.”4 However,
since these documents came out, four large, randomized trials have been published that compared the efﬁcacy of CAS and CEA in management of extracranial
carotid stenosis.5-9 This led the European Society for
Vascular Surgery to update its guidelines, “Management
of Atherosclerotic Carotid and Vertebral Artery Disease”
in 2017.10 Similarly
