 color makes it
easier to establish obstruction, turbulence, and the direction of venous and arterial flow.44 Duplex scanning is
excellent for the evaluation of infrainguinal venous obstruction and valvular incompetence.81 It also differentiates
between acute venous thrombosis and chronic venous
changes.82,83
Technique of the examination. The technique of
venous duplex scanning has been described in detail previously by several authors.80,83-88 The pulsed-wave Doppler
of 4 to 7-MHz linear array tranducers are used most
frequently for the deeper veins, with the higher-frequency
probes used more to assess the superficial veins. Evaluation
of reflux in the deep and superficial veins with duplex
scanning should be performed with the patient upright,

with the leg rotated outward, heel on the ground, and
weight taken on the opposite limb.5 The supine position
gives both false-positive and false-negative results of
reflux.84
The examination is started below the inguinal ligament, and the veins are examined in 3- to 5-cm intervals.
For a complete examination, all deep veins of
