Estimates were highly imprecise to derive conclusions
about the outcomes of death, ipsilateral stroke and
death/stroke at 30 days (8 studies; RR, 0.63; 95% CI,
0.31-1.29; Supplementary Table I, online only), (4 studies;

Outcomes at 5 years. When the long-term outcome of
transfemoral CAS vs CEA in symptomatic patients were
examined using a preplanned pooled analysis of individual patient data from four randomized trials,108 the
risk of death or stroke within 120 days of the index procedure was 5.5% (4.7%-6.5%) for CEA and 8.7% (7.6%9.9%) for CAS. The primary event outcome and ipsilateral
postprocedural stroke at 5 years was 8.3% (7.25%-9.6%)
for CEA vs 11.4% (10.1%-12.8%) for CAS (Supplementary
Table I, online only).
Question 3: Timing of intervention in stroke
We included seven observational studies and one RCT.
As for the observational studies, three of them had an
overall low risk of bias
