 could be adapted and applied locally by nephrologists, dialysis personnel, access surgeons, and patients
to increase the production and use of autogenous AV
access. They also identified system changes that could be
implemented at a national level to encourage the placement
of autogenous AV accesses at a higher rate than prosthetic
AV accesses and catheters, for example, reimbursement for
preoperative vessel mapping to identify adequate vessels for
use for autogenous access construction. As a result of the
efforts of the FFBI, the prevalence of autogenous access
had increased by ⬎50%, from 32% to 49%, by January
2008.
The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), representing
⬎2500 vascular surgeons, recognizes the effect of decision
making by the individual vascular access surgeon on the
construction and utilization of access for hemodialysis.
Therefore, the SVS approved and sponsored two initiatives:
(1) to develop and publish reporting standards for AV
hemodialysis access and (2) to develop practice guidelines
for AV hemodialysis access.
To accomplish the first initiative, the SVS charged a
multidisciplinary committee to develop standardized definitions related to AV access procedures, patency, and complications. Standardization of terminology facilitates more
meaningful comparisons between published reports of
long-term patency and complications of AV access procedures. These recommendations were published in the Journal of Vascular Surgery in 2002.12
To accomplish the second initiative, SVS assembled a
multispecialty expert panel, consisting of vascular access
surgeons and nephrologists, to develop clinical practice
guidelines for AV access placement. In an ongoing effort to
optimize the placement of autogenous AV access in pa-

tients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ESRD, these
guidelines are directed toward AV access surgeons and
specialists (such as interventional radiologists, nephrologists, and cardiologists) as the providers whose ultimate
operative decision determines the type of access placed.
The panel’s recommendations have culminated in the following practice guidelines: optimal timing and indications
for referral of patients with advanced CKD, defined by a
