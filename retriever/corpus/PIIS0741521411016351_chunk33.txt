also reduces the risk of stroke in men and women.128-130
Counseling and smoking cessation medications are effective in helping smokers to quit. Physician counseling is an
important and effective intervention that reduces smoking
in patients by 10% to 20%131 but continues to be underused.132 Nicotine replacement therapy, in the form of
patches and gums, is effective in reducing smoking.133

Patients with extracranial carotid stenosis who are smoking
cigarettes should be counseled to quit.
E. Antithrombotic treatment
No adequately powered studies have been performed
in asymptomatic patients with carotid atherosclerosis to
confirm a benefit with antithrombotic treatment in reducing incident stroke. The US Preventative Services
Task Force has recommended daily aspirin as cardiovascular prophylaxis in patients with anticipated cardiac
morbidity of ⬎3% for men aged ⬎45 years and in women
aged ⬎55 years.134 These recommendations are based
primarily on an observed reduction in overall cardiovascular morbidity and death with aspirin therapy. The
AHA Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and
Stroke agrees with this recommendation.135 There is no
evidence to suggest that antiplatelet agents other than
aspirin have improved benefit in asymptomatic patients
with carotid atherosclerosis.
Evidence for antithrombotic treatment for secondary
prevention of recurrent stroke in symptomatic patients with
carotid atherosclerosis is more robust.100,136-139 The
choice of antiplatelet therapy among aspirin, clopidogrel,
and dipyridamole plus aspirin is not clearly defined because
the data are uncertain.
The Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events140 and Clopidogrel for the Reduction of
Events During Observation141 trials each showed a benefit
of clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone in
reducing vascular events in patients with prior acute coronary syndromes. The Management of Atherothrombosis
