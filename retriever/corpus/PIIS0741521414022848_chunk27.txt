peatedly until tobacco use has stopped).
We recommend statin therapy in patients with symptomatic PAD.
We recommend optimizing diabetes control (hemoglobin A1c goal of <7.0%) in patients with
IC if this goal can be achieved without hypoglycemia.
We recommend the use of indicated b-blockers (eg, for hypertension, cardiac indications) in
patients with IC. There is no evidence supporting concerns about worsening claudication
symptoms.
In patients with IC due to atherosclerosis, we recommend antiplatelet therapy with aspirin
(75-325 mg daily).
We recommend clopidogrel in doses of 75 mg daily as an effective alternative to aspirin for
antiplatelet therapy in patients with IC.
In patients with IC due to atherosclerosis, we suggest against using warfarin for the sole
indication of reducing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events or vascular occlusions.
We suggest against using folic acid and vitamin B12 supplements as a treatment of IC.
In patients with IC who do not have congestive heart failure, we suggest a 3-month trial of
cilostazol (100 mg twice daily) to improve pain-free walking.
In patients with IC who cannot tolerate or have contraindications for cilostazol, we suggest a
trial of pentoxifylline (400 mg thrice daily) to improve pain-free walking.

ACEI, Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; PAD, peripheral arterial disease.
A recommendation (4.11) for using ramipril in IC was originally made but subsequently deleted (see Supplementary
Material on page 41S.e1, online only).

in maximal and pain-free walking distance has been seen

over-the-counter as a dietary supplement.
4C. Exercise therapy for claudication
Exercise therapy has been a cornerstone in the management of IC for >40 years and has been the subject of case
series, randomized trials, and meta-analyses (Table II
