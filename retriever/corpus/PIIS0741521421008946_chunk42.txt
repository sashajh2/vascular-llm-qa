. CEA provides excellent access to the
cervical carotid artery, but lesions that extend outside
this zone can be difﬁcult to treat surgically. It is generally
understood that lesions at or above the level of the C2
cervical vertebra or at or below the clavicle are generally
more difﬁcult to expose surgically during CEA without
increasing the morbidity associated with the procedure.171 Lesions of the distal cervical carotid artery can be
exposed by division of the posterior belly of the digastric
muscle and subluxation or division of the mandible, as
required.171,174 Although rarely required, these high carotid exposures may be associated with increased difﬁculty in directly visualizing the end point of the

endarterectomy as well as increased risk of cranial
nerve injury (CNI), particularly cranial nerve IX.171,174 Lesions of the very proximal CCA are difﬁcult or impossible to expose without extending the incision into the
chest. This must be considered when evaluating the
morbidity of the procedure. There are no extracranial
carotid lesion locations that increase risk of transfemoral CAS
High risk for transfemoral CAS. Tortuosity of the aortic
arch and target vessel can decrease the technical success rate and increase risk of stroke and death among
patients who undergo transfemoral CAS.175 For
example, increased aortic arch tortuosity in a type III
arch can make sheath or guide catheter placement
difﬁcult or impossible.172,173 In addition, signiﬁcant CCA
and/or ICA tortuosity can increase the risk of technical
failure and stroke. In particular, the presence of ICA
tortuosity can make crossing the lesion and positioning
a distal embolic protection ﬁlter difﬁcult. In the
tortuous ICA it may be difﬁcult to ﬁnd a sufﬁcient
length of carotid artery above the lesion with parallel
walls, a challenge that may decrease the effectiveness
of distal embolic protection �
