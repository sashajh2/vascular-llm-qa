 core to more
stable calciﬁed plaque.100 However, there is no compelling evidence that statin therapy is associated with clinically signiﬁcant carotid plaque regression.
When combined with lifestyle and dietary changes,
statin therapy is the most effective pharmacologic therapy for lipid-lowering.101 High intensity statin therapy includes daily atorvastatin 40 to 80 mg or rosuvastatin 20
to 40 mg. Moderate intensity statin therapy includes atorvastatin 10 to 20 mg/day, ﬂuvastatin 40 mg twice daily, or
ﬂuvastatin XL 80 mg, lovastatin 40 mg, pitavastatin 2 to
4 mg, pravastatin 40 to 80 mg, rosuvastatin 5 to 10 mg,
or simvastatin 20 to 40 mg.101 For individuals age 75 or
less with atherosclerotic disease, including carotid artery
disease, recent evidence supports high-intensity statin
therapy, or moderate-intensity statin therapy if highintensity therapy is not tolerated. For older individuals,
moderate-intensity statin therapy is recommended.

Smoking cessation
Smoking is well-recognized as a powerful risk factor for
atherosclerotic disease, including carotid artery disease
and stroke. In the Framingham study of 4255 men and
women aged 36 to 68 years, heavy cigarette smoking
was associated with a two-fold increase in stroke risk
compared with light smokers.102 This ﬁnding was
conﬁrmed in a meta-analysis of 32 studies that demonstrated the risk of stroke is nearly doubled in smokers.103
Moreover, early studies have documented that smoking
cessation reduces stroke risk in both men and
women.104,105
From a mechanistic point of view, recent studies have
suggested that smoking-related stroke risk is related at
least in part to the deleterious effect of smoking on plaque biology in the carotid artery. In a population-based
