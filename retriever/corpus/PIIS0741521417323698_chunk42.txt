Preoperative coronary revascularization. A metaanalysis of 22 studies examining >13,000 patients with
coronary artery disease identiﬁed an AAA in 8.4% of patients.95 Routine coronary artery revascularization in patients with stable cardiac symptoms and absent left

main coronary artery disease or severe aortic stenosis
does not alter the risk of MI, death, or long-term survival
among patients undergoing elective vascular surgery.96,97 Coronary revascularization is indicated for acute
coronary syndrome with or without ST-segment

elevation, unstable angina, and stable angina in the
presence of left main coronary artery or three-vessel
disease as well as for two-vessel disease, including the
proximal left anterior descending artery and either
ischemia on noninvasive testing or reduced left ventricular function.
The risk for perioperative stent thrombosis for both
bare-metal stents and drug-eluting stents in the coronary arteries is highest in the ﬁrst 4 to 6 weeks after
implantation. Surgery should be delayed for 14 days after
coronary angioplasty and 30 days after a bare-metal
stent if dual antiplatelet therapy cannot be continued
through the perioperative period. Likewise, OSR should
not be performed within 6 months after implantation
of a drug-eluting stent if cessation of dual antiplatelet
therapy is required.98 This recommendation assumes
the use of newer generation drug-eluting stents
