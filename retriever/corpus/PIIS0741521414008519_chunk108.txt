10: Deep Venous Reﬂux With Skin
Changes at Risk for Venous Leg Ulcer (C4b), Healed
(C5) or Active (C6) Venous Leg UlcerdLigation
In a patient with infrainguinal deep venous reﬂux
and skin changes at risk for venous leg ulcer (C4b),
healed venous leg ulcer (C5), or active venous leg ulcer
(C6), we suggest against deep vein ligation of the
femoral or popliteal veins as a routine treatment.

Ligation of the femoral and popliteal veins without welldemonstrated collateral pathways risks an increase of outﬂow

obstruction and is not recommended unless effective collaterals can be identiﬁed. Several case reports support ligation
of the femoral vein as a method of eliminating physiologically signiﬁcant reﬂux of the femoral vein when the collateral
pathways of both great saphenous and deep femoral veins
are patent and competent.374-377

Repair
In a patient with infrainguinal deep venous reﬂux
and skin changes at risk for venous leg ulcer (C4b),
healed venous leg ulcer (C5), or active venous leg ulcer
(C6), we suggest individual valve repair for those who
have axial reﬂux with structurally preserved deep
venous valves in addition to standard compression
therapy to aid in venous ulcer healing and to prevent
recurrence. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Several techniques are used to fashion an incompetent
valve into a competent valve. External banding refers to a
synthetic sleeve placed around the circumference of a valve
to reduce the vein circumference and to produce a competent valve. External valvuloplasty is the technique of placing
sutures along the valve attachment line of the intact vein to
decrease the vein diameter with or without actually engaging
the valve lea
