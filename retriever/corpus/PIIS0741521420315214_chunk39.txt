grafting of the thoracic aorta is technically feasible and
nonrandomized studies suggest reduction of early
adverse outcomes, such as paraplegia, mortality, and
hospital stay, high-quality randomized controlled trials
assessing clinically relevant outcomes including open
conversion, aneurysm exclusion, endoleaks, and late
mortality are needed.86,87 In addition, although there
are no randomized, controlled prospective trials
comparing open and endovascular TAA repair and probably never will be, industry-sponsored trials and registry
data (Table) suggest clinical equipoise in centers experienced in both techniques.77-81,84,85,88-95
Recommendation 10: In patients who could undergo
either technique (within the criteria of the deviceâ€™s instructions for use), we recommend TEVAR as the
preferred approach to treat elective DTA aneurysms,
given its reduced morbidity and length of stay as well
as short-term mortality. Level of recommendation:
Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: A (High)
