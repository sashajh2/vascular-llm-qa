ed in the accompanying meta-analysis
is shown in Table I.12 Notably, the mean patient age
among all patients was 68.7 years and the majority
were smokers, hypertensive, and had evidence of peripheral artery disease. Unlike most other cardiovascular disorders associated with atherosclerotic occlusive disease,
the majority of patients with CMI are women. There is a

small percentage of patients that present in the third
to fourth decades of life and may have a different female
to male sex ratio (eg, 1:1 for coarctation and 5:1 for vasculitis). Furthermore, they do not have the usual atherosclerotic risk factors and associated systemic vascular
disease.26-29 However, these guidelines are restricted to
patients with CMI from atherosclerotic occlusive disease,
as noted elsewhere in these guidelines.
The presence of MAOD, in contradistinction to CMI, is
quite common. As noted, Wilson et al1 reported that
17% of independent, elderly adults (n ¼ 553) had evidence of signiﬁcant occlusive disease in the CA or SMA
on routine mesenteric DUS screening. However, there
were no deaths attributable to mesenteric infarction at
follow-up (mean, 6.5 years) in this population and none
of the surveyed survivors (71%) reported symptoms
consistent with CMI. Unselected autopsy studies have reported the presence of a stenosis of 50% or more in at
least one of the mesenteric vessels in up to 10% of
patients and almost 30% of patients undergoing
catheter-based arteriography before peripheral artery
revascularization had evidence of a comparable degree
of stenosis in either the CA or SMA.2,3 A recent report
from Zettervall et al30 examining the national trends in
mortality for both CMI and AMI from the Nationwide
Inpatient Sample and Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention database reported that there has been a dramatic increase in the number of endovascular procedures for both conditions. This ﬁnding was associated
with a decrease in the population mortality for AMI but
no change for CMI, suggesting that the widespread
adoption of the endovascular approach was responsible
