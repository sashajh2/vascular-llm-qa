9.7 minutes, and ⬎60% of cases
involving 10 to 20 incisions. Discoloration of the skin was
noted in eight patients (2.3%), excessive or hypertrophic
scarring in two (0.6%), and cellulitis in one (0.3%). There
were no significant hematomas and no recurrent varicose
veins at 12 weeks in this series, and overall, 99.7% reported
good outcomes and satisfaction.
Although no published data clearly show any statistically significant advantage of TIPP over conventional phlebectomy except for fewer incisions, most published literature represents earlier-generation systems and techniques.
With the newer-generation system and modified technique
and learning curve adjustments, TIPP has become less
traumatic, which may decrease potential complications and
improve outcomes over those previously reported. Until
new trials are performed, any additional potential benefits
of TIPP have yet to be substantiated.
Results with preservation of the saphenous vein. Results
with CHIVA. Two RCTs188,191 compared standard treatment (compression or high ligation, stripping, and phlebectomy) with CHIVA approaches with specific anatomic
patterns of reflux (types I and III shunts). For the specific
venous anatomy evaluated in these trials, such techniques
were better than compression in preventing ulcer recurrence188 and were at least equivalent to stripping of varicose
veins.191
In a single-center RCT, Zamboni et al188 used CHIVA
or compression to treat 47 legs with venous ulcers. At a
mean follow-up of 3 years, healing was 100% (median
healing time, 31 days) in the surgical group and 96%
(median healing time, 63 days) in the compression group
(P ⬍ .02). The recurrence rate was 9% in the surgical group
and 38% in the compression group (P ⬍ .05). The study
excluded patients with post-thrombotic syndrome, deep
vein reflux or obstruction, or excessive ulcers (⬎12 cm).
