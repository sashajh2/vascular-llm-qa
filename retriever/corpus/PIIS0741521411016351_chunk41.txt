otid cross-clamping, and therefore the increased likelihood that a shunt will be needed, during CEA, include recent stroke, contralateral carotid occlusion, and
symptoms suggestive of hemodynamic cerebral insufficiency.168,169 Despite extensive study on the routine or
selective use of shunts and cerebral monitoring during
CEA, no clear benefit of one approach over the other has
emerged.170
The routine use of completion imaging after CEA also
remains an area of controversy. Although a number of
authors have reported detecting abnormalities in 5% to 10%
of patients using completion DUS imaging,171,172 and a
cost-benefit analysis suggests completion DUS imaging
increases quality-adjusted life-years by 2%,173 the clinical
significance of many of these abnormalities is uncertain,
and several series have reported excellent results without
use of completion imaging.174-176 Like the choice of anesthesia and shunting, completion imaging remains a matter
of personal preference.
There are, however, data to recommend the use of
patch angioplasty or eversion endarterectomy over standard endarterectomy with primary closure. Women and
individuals with small ICAs are at most risk of early neurologic events and late restenosis if standard endarterectomy
with primary closure is performed. Randomized studies
have shown the benefit of patch closure over primary
closure in patients undergoing standard CEA.177 The type
of patch material does not appear to have a significant effect
on outcome. Prospective comparisons of eversion CEA
with primary closure178 have demonstrated a benefit of the
eversion technique for reduction of early and late stroke.

This has been borne out by low rates of early stroke and late
restenosis in large single-center reports.179
A number of investigations have studied the relationship of operative volume and specialty training with outcome. Although data suggest that there is some relationship between operative volume and outcome, the effect
appears less than with other procedures.180 In a large study
of Medicare populations in Maryland and California, surgeons who perform 10 to 15 CEAs per year have better
results than those who perform ‚¨ç
