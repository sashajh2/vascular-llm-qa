most modern bandages combine different material
components. Because of friction between these components and the use of adhesive surfaces, multicomponent bandages provide nonyielding cuffs of high
stiffness around the leg, even when their individual
components are elastic. This stiffness of elastic textiles
results in an increase of sub-bandage pressure when patients stand up or when they walk.5 Examples are
“multilayer bandages” like Profore (Smith & Nephew,
Memphis, Tenn), Comprifore (Jobst, Charlotte, NC), and
Coban 2 (3M, St. Paul, Minn) as a “two-layer” version. In
fact, every bandage is composed of more than one layer
and therefore the term multilayer bandage is
misleading. Such multicomponent bandages should
be applied with a pressure of approximately 50 mm
Hg on the lower leg and >30 mm Hg on the thigh.6

By using specially formed pads, such pressures can be
achieved locally over the treated vein, even when using
compression stockings. This is due to the artiﬁcial reduction of the local leg radius (law of Laplace). The compression could be eccentric,12,13 eccentric and concentric,14 or
tangential.15,16
The concept that compression needs to be graduated,
providing a pressure decrease from distal to proximal,
seems to be less important after vein procedures in mobile patients. Even a foot-sparing compression bandage
may be considered, which promotes ankle mobility
and walking, preventing edema in the noncompressed
parts.17

COMPLIANCE
One major problem with compression therapy is poor
adherence by the patient, especially when long-term
management is planned.18 The main complaints reported by patients are difﬁculties during the process of
donning (pulling up) and dofﬁng (removing) compression stockings, problems with slipping of ﬁxed bandages
down the leg, and concerns with hygiene because these
must be worn for prolonged periods. The pain relief and
other beneﬁts experienced
