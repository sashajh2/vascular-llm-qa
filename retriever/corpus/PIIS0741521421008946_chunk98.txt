 the
ansa-cervicalis and using it as a retractor to move the hypoglossal nerve out of the ﬁeld and protect it.171,330-332
Summary and recommendations.
1. Surgeons should anticipate the presence of distal disease extension preoperatively and plan for this in
advance in case a high exposure of the ICA is
necessary.
Wound drainage and hematoma after CEA
Stone et al165 reported that reexploration for neck hematomas were required in 1.3% of CEA patients on
aspirin, 0.9% on clopidogrel, and 1.5% of patients taking
aspirin and clopidogrel. There is no evidence that dual
antiplatelet therapy signiﬁcantly increases hematoma
risk.165,333-335 In one study, protamine reversal demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant reduction of neck hematoma formation after CEA. However, the amount of
heparin that was used was not mentioned, and this
may also be a mitigating factor. There are further data
for comparison. A vast majority of hematomas occur in
the ﬁrst six hours after CEA, often after a period of poorly
controlled hypertension. The rationale for placing a
wound drain after CEA is that it should prevent hematoma formation as well as resultant, and potential major
complications such as respiratory compromise or potential nidus for abscess formation, which may cause patch
infection. Small caliber suction drains (#10F) do not
seem to decrease the incidence or prevalence of

hematoma, whereas larger drains (14F) may help.336
Despite ﬁndings from this single randomized trial, there
are not enough convincing data to support mandating
drain or no drainage of CEA incisions. Any evidence of
stridor or tracheal deviation mandates immediate
wound exploration and hematoma evacuation.
Summary and recommendations.
1. The decision for use of drainage post CEA should be
left up to the operating surgeon.
2. Patients on heparin anticoagulation may beneﬁt from
