 skin changes, such as pigmentation or eczema
(C4a) or lipodermatosclerosis or atrophie blanche (C4b),
and healed (C5) or active (C6) ulcer. The presence or
absence of symptoms is also recorded as S (symptomatic) or
A (asymptomatic).
Etiology can be congenital (Ec), primary (Ep), or secondary (Es).
The anatomic classification separates superficial venous
disease (As) from involvement of the perforators (Ap) or
deep veins (Ad). Failure to identify an anatomic location is
also coded (An).
Pathophysiology of the disease can be reflux (Pr), obstruction (Po), or both. Failure to identify venous pathophysiology is also noted (Pn). Table II includes the full
CEAP classification, and Table III lists the venous segments that can be involved in the disease.

We recommend that in patients with chronic venous disease, evaluation
for thrombophilia is needed selectively for those with recurrent deep
vein thrombosis, thrombosis at a young age, or thrombosis in an
unusual site. Laboratory examination is needed in patients with longstanding venous stasis ulcers (blood cell count and metabolic panel)
and in selected patients who undergo general anesthesia for the
treatment of chronic venous disease.

We recommend that the CEAP classification be used for patients with varicose
veins. The basic CEAP classification is used for clinical practice, and the full
