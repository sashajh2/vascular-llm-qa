 patients with incompetent pathologic perforators associated with symptomatic residual, recurrent, and rarely primary varicosities, without
associated saphenous incompetence, either open or
endovascular techniques can be used to treat the
perforator veins.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Since IPVs are potential sources of recurrence, occlusion of relevant IPVs is indicated in C2 patients who have symptomatic recurrent or residual
varicose veins after previous superﬁcial truncal ablation
and tributary treatment. Perforating veins may also rarely

be source of primary varicose veins in the absence of
saphenous incompetence.
Evidence. Various techniques have been used to treatment of IPV, from the Linton procedure to subfascial
endoscopic perforator surgery (SEPS) and to less invasive
techniques of ligation through mini phlebectomy and
endovenous procedures.225 The Linton and the SEPS
procedures today are of historic interest only, but SEPS
was useful to gain insight into the efﬁcacy of occlusion of
IPVs.226 In an RCT by Kianifard et al,227 72 patients with
C2 disease were treated with HL&S 6 phlebectomy, 38
also underwent the SEPS procedure. At 1 year, no additional clinical beneﬁt could be observed, when SEPS was
added to HL&S. It should therefore be emphasized that
SEPS or any other technique for perforator treatment
concomitant with initial superﬁcial axial reﬂux treatment
in C2 disease is not recommended.8
Despite these general ﬁndings, perforating veins may
occasionally be the source of primary varicose veins in
the absence of saphenous reﬂux. In a review of 835 limbs
referred to the vascular laboratory for CVD, isolated nonsaphenous origin reﬂux was found in 84 (10%).228 Ninety
percent of these limbs were CEAP class 1 t 3. Thigh perforators were found in 36 limbs (43%, although only 53% of
these demonstrated reﬂux) while 8% of limbs had reﬂux
arising from the vein of the popliteal fossa, and
