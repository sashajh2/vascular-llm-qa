 recurrent stroke compared
with low-dose aspirin þ dipyridamole (OR, 0.75; 95% CI,
0.52-1.02) and clopidogrel (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.51-1.05),
but these differences were not statistically signiﬁcant.138
Finally, some surgeons selectively use dextran 40 in the
immediate postoperative period after CEA. The rationale
for use relates to case series that identiﬁed transcranial
Doppler (TCD)-detected microembolization which occurs during CEA and immediately postoperatively, and
the reduced number of microemboli with dextran 40
infusion. For example, in a series of 163 patients who underwent CEA, dextran 40 was infused for any patient
who manifested more than 25 emboli within 10 minutes.
It was infused in nine patients (5%) and rapidly

controlled embolization.139 In a similar study, 156 patients
undergoing CEA were randomized to receive dextran 40
or placebo. TCD detected embolic signals in 57% of placebo and 42% of dextran patients. At 2 to 3 hours postoperatively, embolic signals were detected in 45% of
placebo and 27% of dextran patients, with embolic
signal counts 64% lower for dextran patients (P ¼
.040).140 In a report of 400 patients monitored with
TCD during CEA, more than 25 emboli in 10 minutes after
unclamping were detected in 216 patients (54%).
Following initiation of dextran 40, embolization ceased
in all cases and there were no strokes or acute carotid
thromboses in these patients.141 Another review reported
a 46% decrease in emboli when dextran was administered during CEA.142
