 (ICST)6 enrolled 1713 patients and demonstrated
signiﬁcantly increased periprocedural stroke risk for
transfemoral CAS (7.7%) compared with CEA (4.1%) in
neurologically symptomatic patients (P < .002). The risk
of any stroke or death less than 30 days after treatment
in the stenting group was more than twice that in the
endarterectomy group (7.4% vs 3.4%; P < .0004). In addition, the composite end point of stroke, death, and MI
signiﬁcantly favored CEA (5.2%) vs transfemoral CAS
(8.5%; P < .006). These ﬁndings are similar to those of
the symptomatic patients in the CREST Trial. Periprocedural risk of stroke and death was signiﬁcantly higher
in transfemoral CAS vs CEA among symptomatic patients (6.0% 6 0.9% vs 3.2% 6 0.7%; HR, 1.89; 95% CI,
1.11-3.21; P < .02). The risk of MI was lower after transfemoral CAS vs CEA among symptomatic patients
(1.0% 6 0.4% vs 2.3% 6 0.6%; HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.18-1.11;
P < .08); however, these differences were not signiﬁcant.
If CREST patients older than 80 years are removed to
allow CREST to be compared with other trials, results
from the symptomatic cohort demonstrated that
30-day stroke and death risk was signiﬁcantly lower
among the patients undergoing CEA (2.6%þ0.7% for
CEA and 5.6%þ1.0% for transfemoral CAS; P ¼ .006). A
