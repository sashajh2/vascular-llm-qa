early outcome. Nonthermal techniques are preferred
for ablation of reﬂuxing distal calf saphenous veins to
avoid thermal nerve injury.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Studies have shown that thermal ablation of
the below-knee GSV is feasible and safe.151 In addition,
nonthermal techniques are available if there are concerns about saphenous nerve injury. Elimination of
below-knee GSV reﬂux has been shown to improve
symptoms and reduce the need for additional procedures, compared with ablation of the above-knee GSV
only.152-154
Evidence. Several studies showed better results of
above-knee GSV ablation when there was no residual
below-knee GSV reﬂux.152,153 In a systematic review,
Sussman et al33 found that above-knee-below-knee
