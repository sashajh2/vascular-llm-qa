aks as well
as sac enlargement.748-752 Ultrasound eliminates radiation exposure, reduces cost, and avoids use of a nephrotoxic contrast agent. Further surveillance with ultrasound
is safe if CT imaging 1 year after EVAR demonstrates no
endoleak and stable sac size747,752 or for those patients
with a type II endoleak and a stable aneurysm size.751 A
new endoleak, graft migration, or aneurysm sac growth
>5 to 10 mm should prompt further evaluation with a
CT scan.
Surveillance outcomes. Surveillance noncompliance
rates approach 60%,753,754 with gaps observed 3 to 4
years after EVAR, particularly among patients of
advanced age, with Medicaid eligibility, or after treatment at a low-volume center.753,755 Although the risks of
late device-related complications and aneurysm rupture
are well documented, population studies have not
demonstrated that annual EVAR surveillance confers a
survival beneﬁt or decreases aneurysm-related mortality.754,756 Not all late ruptures are preceded by endoleak
or sac enlargement, which suggests that not all late
ruptures can be prevented by vigilant surveillance.757,758
Summary. Current recommendations for surveillance
after EVAR include a CT scan at 1 month. Concerning
ﬁndings should prompt surveillance at 6 months. In the
absence of a type I or type III endoleak and sac enlargement, surveillance can be performed with CT or color
duplex ultrasound. Annual duplex ultrasound is most
likely sufﬁcient for routine surveillance in the absence
of new endoleak or sac enlargement. New ﬁndings
should prompt CT imaging to evaluate for type I or

type III endoleaks. Abdominal and pelvic CT imaging
should be performed every 5 years after OSR or EVAR.
We recommend baseline imaging in the ﬁrst month after EVAR
with contrast-enhanced CT and color duplex ultrasound
imaging. In the absence of an endoleak or sac enlargement,
imaging should be repeated in 12 months
