 or Active Venous Ulcer
In a patient with isolated pathologic perforator veins (outward ﬂow of >500 ms duration, with a diameter of
>3.5 mm) located beneath or associated with the healed (C5) or active ulcer (C6) bed regardless of the status of the
deep veins, we suggest ablation of the “pathologic” perforating veins in addition to standard compression therapy
to aid in venous ulcer healing and to prevent recurrence. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]

Guideline 6.8: Treatment Alternatives for Pathologic Perforator Veins
For those patients who would beneﬁt from pathologic perforator vein ablation, we recommend treatment by
percutaneous techniques that include ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy or endovenous thermal ablation (radiofrequency or laser) over open venous perforator surgery to eliminate the need for incisions in areas of compromised
skin. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 6.9: Infrainguinal Deep Venous Obstruction and Skin Changes at Risk for Venous Leg Ulcer (C4b),
Healed (C5) or Active (C6) Venous Leg Ulcer
In a patient with infrainguinal deep venous obstruction and skin changes at risk for venous leg ulcer (C4b),
healed venous leg ulcer (C5), or active venous leg ulcer (C6), we suggest autogenous venous bypass or endophlebectomy in addition to standard compression therapy to aid in venous ulcer healing and to prevent recurrence.

Guideline 6.10: Deep Venous Reﬂux With Skin Changes at Risk for Venous Leg Ulcer (C4b), Healed (C5) or
Active (C6) Venous Leg UlcerdLigation
In a patient with infrainguinal deep venous reﬂux and skin changes at risk for venous leg ulcer (C4b), healed
venous leg ulcer (C5), or active venous leg ulcer (C6), we suggest against deep vein ligation of the
