 The Prevention of Cerebral Embolization by Proximal Balloon Occlusion
compared with Filter Protection during Carotid Artery
Stenting (PROFI) study is the only randomized trial
that compared ﬁlter-protected vs proximal balloonprotected transfemoral CAS. The study reported a
signiﬁcantly lower incidence of ischemic lesions after
proximal occlusion compared with distal ﬁlters (6.5%
vs 29%; P ¼ .05) with a DWI risk of 87% with distal ﬁlters
vs 45% with proximal occlusion.383 In a meta-analysis of
eight studies comparing ﬁlter protection vs proximal
occlusion, Stabile et al384 a reported lower incidence
of newer ischemic lesions in patients undergoing proximal occlusion.
Distal ﬁlter devices. Distal ﬁlter devices are most
commonly used for CAS, and they have the advantage
of smaller diameter and maintaining the antegrade ICA
ﬂow throughout the procedure. Several distal ﬁlters are
available and each is compatible with a stent system
such as the Emboshield Nav6, Rx Accunet (Abott Laboratories, Abott Park, Ill), Angioguard Rx (Cordis, Melpitas,
Calif), and FilterWire EZ (Boston Scientiﬁc) and Spider
FX (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland). However, there is no evidence of the superiority of one distal ﬁlter over
another.385
The microporous ﬁlter must be deployed in a straight
segment of the ICA to allow apposition of the ﬁlter to
the vessel wall. It must be placed in the distal ICA at a
sufﬁcient distance to allow safe deployment of the distal
end of the stents without trapping of the ﬁlter. Visualization of the sheath should be maintained at all times to
prevent prolapse of the sheath into the arch, which could
dislodge the ﬁlter and pull it through the carotid
lesion.366
The main disadvantage of using distal ﬁlters is that the
lesion must be passed initially which increases risk of cerebral embol
