radial
access, crossover and radiation dose were higher. Moreover, hospitalization was shorter with transradial access
in the per-protocol analysis.378
Technique for radial/brachial approach. A micropuncture access set is used for brachial artery access, whereas a
GlidesheathÔ hydrophilic-coated nitinol micropuncture
set (Terumo Medical, Somerset, NJ), is used for radial artery
access.378 Patients undergoing radial artery access are given
both verapamil (0.075-0.15 mg/kg) and nitroglycerin (100200 mg for a 70-kg patient) as boluses through the sheath as
antispasmodics. Anticoagulation during the procedure is
achieved upon access to the target vessel with unfractionated heparin with the goal of keeping activated clotting
time of greater than 250 up to 300 seconds. The target CCA
is initially cannulated using standard techniques, and an
angled catheter (ie, Cobra, Headhunter) is usually used. A
0.035-inch hydrophilic coated wire is then used to position
the catheter into the CCA or external carotid artery,
depending on anatomy. Once access is secured with a
medium body wire, the 5F sheath is exchanged for a 6F
shuttle sheath and advanced over the wire once the target
CCA or external carotid artery is engaged.
CAS is then performed using standard techniques.
Once the procedure is complete, the heparin is actively
reversed with protamine sulfate. Manual pressure is
applied for brachial access, and a TR Band assisted
compression device (Terumo Interventional Systems,
Irvine, Calif) is used for radial access.
Transcarotid artery revascularization. Direct open cervical access of the CCA offers the advantage of avoiding the
atherosclerotic arch and crossing the major vessels. It can
be performed under general, regional or local anesthesia
with conscious sedation. Preoperative duplex ultrasound
examination and/or CTA is needed to evaluate the CCA
and its bifurcations. The proximal cervical CCA must be
free of severe calciﬁcation and atheroma. A minimal 6
