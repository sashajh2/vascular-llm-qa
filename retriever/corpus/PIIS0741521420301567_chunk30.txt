 for renovascular hypertension preoperatively
and demonstrated that 100% of those operated on
with documented renovascular hypertension improved
or were cured of hypertension, whereas only 60% of
those with an unremarkable workup for stenosis were
cured or improved. Pfeiffer et al50 similarly noted a
differential
improvement
in
hypertension
after
aneurysm repair in those with documented renal artery
stenosis (67%) in comparison to those without
stenosis (29%).

Distal parenchymal embolization has been described
in 8% to 11% of patients with RAA and may be associated
with the presence of mural thrombus within the aneurysm sac.49,50 Duplex ultrasound may demonstrate evidence of microembolization, although elevated
resistance in this setting may be difﬁcult to differentiate
from nephrosclerosis.27
The variable conventional in situ reconstructions available include aneurysm resection with primary angioplastic closure (with or without branch reimplantation),
patch angioplasty, primary reanastomosis, interposition
bypass, aortorenal bypass, splanchnic-renal bypass, and
plication of small aneurysms. Surgery consistently offers
low elective mortality rates that approach 0% across series.14,32,34,37-39,49,51,56-58 Perioperative morbidity is not
insigniﬁcant and is mainly reported <20% after in situ
reconstruction, and secondary nephrectomy rates,
when reported, are 0% to 21%.14,31,32,34,37-39,49,51 In addition, the reported durable primary patency rates (93%100%) are of utmost importance in light of the young
age of many patients and excellent projected longterm survival that averages 90% at 10 years.31,32,49,59
The technical approach selected should be dictated
entirely by the patient’s arterial and aneurysmal anatomy.
Whereas there are no prospective or randomized
data comparing open surgical techniques, Henke et al37
