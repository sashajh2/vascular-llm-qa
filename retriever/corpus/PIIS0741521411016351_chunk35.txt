Parenteral and oral anticoagulants are effective in the
prevention of embolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation or prosthetic heart valves. However, warfarin anticoagulation has been shown to be less effective than antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of neurologic events in
patients with carotid atherosclerosis who do not have a
history of atrial fibrillation and is not indicated in patients
with symptoms of cerebral ischemia.150,151 The WarfarinAspirin Reduced Cardiac Ejection Fraction Study trial is
currently investigating the potential advantage in preventing cardioembolic stroke of anticoagulation vs aspirin in
patients with chronic congestive heart failure.152

␤-blockade therapy before CEA to achieve a stable blood
pressure and heart rate of 60 to 80 beats/min.153,154
Given the near ubiquity of this condition in patients with
carotid stenosis, ␤-blockade is nearly universally required
in this patient group.
Patients taking combined aspirin and clopidogrel therapy in the perioperative period have a 0.4% to 1.0% higher
risk of major bleeding compared with aspirin alone.155
Aspirin therapy alone does not have to be discontinued
before CEA.156 The risks of periprocedural MI from aspirin
withdrawal outweigh the risk of fatal or severe bleeding
from aspirin use. The ACC Perioperative Guidelines endorses the continued use of aspirin before and after
CEA.153 A low dose (81 to 325 mg) appears at least as
effective as higher doses, and higher doses may in fact be
less effective.157 Patients should continue aspirin therapy
after CEA indefinitely, according to recommendations for
high-risk patients with atherosclerosis.100,136-139
There has been a consensus that preprocedural clopidogrel should be stopped approximately 5 days before
elective CABG.46 Recent data from a large
