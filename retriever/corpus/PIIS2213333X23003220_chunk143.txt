subjects to 5-20 events per 1000 people) according to
criteria developed by a Chest expert panel.237 No trials
randomizing patients to early ultrasound screening vs
observation have been performed, and are unlikely to
be done, given the large number of patients such a trial
would require achieving adequate power in the setting
of this low event rate. Assuming a pooled incidence of
all venous thromboembolic (VTE) events of 1.5%, a randomized clinical trial evaluating the ability of screening
DUS to reduce the incidence to 1% would require
approximately 15,500 patients.238 Furthermore, routine
ultrasound screening is not recommended even in populations at higher risk for VTE, including critically ill patients with coronavirus 2019 (ungraded consensus
recommendation)239; those undergoing orthopedic surgery (Grade 1B against),240 nonorthopedic surgery (Grade
2C against)241; and major trauma patients (Grade 2C
against).241 Based on the low incidence of thromboembolic complications in asymptomatic patients, the high
cost of routine DUS, the futility of performing randomized trials evaluating the utility of routine DUS, and

recommendations against screening in other higherrisk populations, we recommend against routine ultrasound surveillance following saphenous vein ablation in
low or average risk patients for thrombotic complications
Although evidence in randomized trials of routine ultrasound screening is lacking, the strength of our recommendation is 1 (strong) against screening in this patient
population, given the futility of performing such studies.
Evidence. A systematic review of 39 RCTs and 33 observational studies (31,663 patients in total) undergoing
routine DUS within 4 weeks of thermal or nonthermal
ablation of the GSV, SSV, or accessory veins, found
