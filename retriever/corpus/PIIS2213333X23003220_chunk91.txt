6. Interventions to preserve the GSV
6.1.1. For patients with early stages of symptomatic
varicose veins we suggest preserving the GSV using
the ambulatory selective variceal ablation under local
anesthesia (ASVAL) technique, if performed by a physician who is familiar with the strategy.

GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence B (moderate)
Rationale and evidence. The ASVAL is a GSV-sparing
method that involves detailed DUS mapping of all varicose tributaries connecting to the GSV and ambulatory
phlebectomy.173,174 The operation is based on the
ascending theory which is that the venous disease process develops in tributaries and distal truncal veins and
“ascends” to the junction and the deep venous system.175
A systematic review of the ASVAL procedure in 2021
included two RCTs, one case-control and three cohort
studies, and ﬁve case series (Table XVI). Varicose vein
recurrence at 1 year ranged from 0.55% to 13.5%, and GSV
incompetence resolved in 50% to 85% at 1 year after the
intervention.31 Another study reported absence of GSV
reﬂux at 1 year in 98% of limbs with competent SFJ at
presentation and in 42% of those with an incompetent
SFJ at presentation.177 Although the level of evidence was
low in the systematic review, ambulatory phlebectomy of
varicose tributaries creating a venous reservoir may have a
positive effect on truncal reﬂux and ASVAL may be an
effective minimally invasive treatment of CVD. Best results were seen in those patients who had a competent
terminal valve at the SFJ.177 The level of evidence for
ASVAL was upgraded to B (moderate) because of the
recent
