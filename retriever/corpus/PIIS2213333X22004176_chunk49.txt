 resulted in a higher closure rate
at 6 weeks and lower recurrence at 1 year than open surgery. The quality of evidence was low to suggest the use of
physician-compounded UGFS over surgery. Additional
RCTs with longer follow-up are needed to deﬁne the
optimal treatment of SSV ablation. However, the lack of
neurologic injury after nonthermal ablation is promising
and appears to be of considerable clinical beneﬁt.
AAGSV and PAGSV. The AAGSV and PAGSV are superﬁcial truncal veins that join the GSV just distal to the SFJ
(Fig 1). They could require treatment if axial incompetence has been conﬁrmed in patients with symptomatic
varicose veins. The PAGSV is rarely of clinical signiﬁcance164,165; however, an incompetent AAGSV alone, or
combined with GSV reﬂux, frequently contributes to varicosities and also to more advanced chronic venous insufﬁciency. An incompetent AAGSV has been a source of
recurrence after GSV ablation and also carries morbidity
similar to that of a reﬂuxing GSV.166-168 The incidence of
superﬁcial thrombosis in one study was signiﬁcantly higher
in the AAGSV than in the GSV (6.41% vs 2.17%; P < .05).167
Endovenous therapies for the treatment of symptomatic

AAGSVs demonstrated early outcomes similar to those of
patients with symptomatic GSV reﬂux.57,169 For standalone
ablations, the revised VCSSs were similar between the
groups before and after the procedure; however, the CIVIQ20 scores had returned to the preintervention levels for
patients who had undergone standalone ablation of the
AAGSV at 6 months, suggesting that patients with a
symptomatic AAGSV treated with ablation will also require
treatment of the associated tributaries (varicosities) to
achieve outcomes similar to those for patients who had
undergone GSV ablation.57
