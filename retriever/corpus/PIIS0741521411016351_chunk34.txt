 are uncertain.
The Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events140 and Clopidogrel for the Reduction of
Events During Observation141 trials each showed a benefit
of clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone in
reducing vascular events in patients with prior acute coronary syndromes. The Management of Atherothrombosis
with Clopidogrel in High-risk Patients142 subsequently
demonstrated no significant difference in vascular events
between symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis treated
with clopidogrel plus aspirin compared with clopidogrel
alone.
Clopidogrel alone was initially shown to have a small
advantage over aspirin in this subset of patients in the
Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischaemic
Events143 trial. However, it costs more than aspirin, and
the subsequent Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic
Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance144 trial showed that clopidogrel plus aspirin was
equivalent to aspirin alone in preventing vascular events in
patients with a prior stroke, TIA, or other cardiovascular
disease or in patients with high risk for cardiovascular
disease.
Antiplatelet agents are therefore recommended for patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA associated with carotid atherosclerosis. Aspirin (50-325 mg/
d), the combination of aspirin and extended-release
dipyridamole, and clopidogrel, are all acceptable options
for initial therapy; a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel
is not recommended.
Aspirin is currently the most commonly used antiplatelet agent and one of the most frequently prescribed drugs,
with as many as 30 million Americans on long-term aspirin
regimens. A growing body of evidence suggests that some

Parenteral and oral anticoagulants are effective in the
prevention of embolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation or prosthetic heart valves. However, warfarin anticoagulation has been shown to be less effective than antiplate
