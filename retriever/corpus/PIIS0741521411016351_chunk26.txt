incidence of residual and recurrent carotid stenosis after
CEA in ACAS was 13%.88 Of 136 patients who had restenosis, 8 (5.9%) underwent reoperation, only 1 of whom was
symptomatic. There was no correlation between late stroke
and recurrent stenosis. Similarly, Cao et al89 randomized
1353 patients who underwent CEA. Of these, the eversion
technique was used in 678, and standard CEA with primary
closure was done in 419 and patch closure in 256. The
life-table estimate of the cumulative risk of restenosis at 4
years was 4% in the eversion CEA group and 9% in the
standard CEA group, and 98% of these patients were
asymptomatic.
Several studies have reported the progression of contralateral stenosis after CEA.91-93 Contralateral carotid stenosis progression was more frequent than ipsilateral recurrent stenosis during the long-term follow-up in these
studies. These studies also identified that the risk of contralateral carotid artery stenosis progression depends on the
existing disease at the time of the initial CEA.91-93 The risk
of progression for moderate stenosis at the initial surveillance to severe stenosis can be as high as five times.92
Several large prospective studies94-99 have analyzed the
rate of carotid in-stent restenosis after CAS. More patients
had ⬎70% stenosis of the ipsilateral carotid artery 1 year
after CAS than after CEA (19% vs 5%). Use of CDUS to
diagnose post-CAS restenosis is confounded by changes in
the velocity criterion caused by the stent itself, and standard
diagnostic criteria do not apply. Artifacts associated with
both CTA and MRA similarly limit the utility of these
techniques in the post-CAS patient. DSA is required to
confirm restenosis after CAS identified by CDUS when
reintervention is contemplated. In contrast, CDUS is sufficient to diagnose and plan therapy for restenosis after
CEA.
