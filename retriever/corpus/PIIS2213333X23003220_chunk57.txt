 evidence, the study concluded that
MPFF was highly effective in improving leg symptoms,
edema, and QOL in patients with CVD. The RELIEF study
enrolled 4527 patients with CEAP Class C0 to C4. Approximately 40% of patients belonged to CEAP Class C2. Participants were treated for a period of 6 months and had
signiﬁcant evolving improvement of symptoms, QOL
measured by the CIVIQ instrument and edema assessed
by leg circumference.111 More recently, an RCT compared
two galenic formulations of MPFF, tablets and sachets,

and included 1139 patients with C2s stage representing
44.95% to 49.46%.113 The authors concluded that both
formulations resulted in similar improvement of symptoms and QOL.
A meta-analysis of 10 trials included 1010 patients
treated with MPFF, hydroxyethylrutosides, ruscus extracts, and diosmin. MPFF signiﬁcantly reduced ankle
edema (P < .0001), while the efﬁcacy of the other two
VADS was comparable.112 Another meta-analysis15
compared the efﬁcacy of sulodexide, MPFF, hydroxyethyl
rutosides, calcium dobesilate, ruscus extracts, horse
chestnut extracts, and pentoxifylline. The primary
outcome was ulcer healing, but the drug effects on the
leg volume, ankle circumference, symptoms, as well as
QOL (CIVIQ-20 score) were also assessed. MPFF had superior effectiveness in leg volume reduction, pain, and
improved QOL. Although not within the scope of this
guideline, it is worth mentioning that in a meta-analysis
of ﬁve RCTs, MPFF improved ulcer healing.15,114 The
main MPFF component, diosmin, is effective alone,
although its efﬁcacy is signiﬁcantly less than that of
MPFF.112,115
Five unblinded open-label clinical trials were included
in a systematic review investigating the effects of VADs
on recovery after surgery, endovenous ablation, or sclerotherapy2
