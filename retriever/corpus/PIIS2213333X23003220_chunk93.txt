GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence B (moderate)
Rationale. The Ambulatory CHIVA was designed to
approach venous hemodynamic insufﬁciency while preserving the GSV, lower transmural pressure in the superﬁcial venous system and avoid removal of varicose
tributaries.178 The goal of CHIVA is to correct the
abnormal hemodynamic pathways that are identiﬁed
with detailed preoperative mapping using DUS. Three
types of “shunts” are identiﬁed during DUS. Truncal veins
are ligated selectively, at the “escape points,” where the
reﬂux starts, and the “reentry points’, the perforators,
where blood enters from the superﬁcial into the deep
system, are preserved. Phlebectomies are not performed
and reduction of the venous pressure reduces the size of
varicose veins a few months after the operation.178
Evidence. Two systematic reviews by BellmuttMontoya et al27,28 studied the CHIVA procedure,
comparing them to HL&S and to endovenous procedures (Table XVII). The last review in 2021
