Answer
B. Transcarotid Artery Revascularization (TCAR)
Discussion: Considering the patient has a symptomatic carotid artery lesion, her disease

procedures are often a safer option in the elderly, medically comorbid patients, especially

In addition, TCAR can be performed under local anesthesia with sedation. This makes
TCAR a safer option relative to open CEA, making B a better answer than C.
