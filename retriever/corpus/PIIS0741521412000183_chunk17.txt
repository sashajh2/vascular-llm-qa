 as improvements in
the surrogate markers of valvular incompetence (reflux) and
persistent venous obstruction.19 Competing risks include those associated with surgery (surgical thrombectomy) and bleeding (thrombolytic strategies). Systematic review of comparative studies suggests that adverse
events are poorly reported overall19 and that caution is
warranted in ensuring patients are appropriately selected.
The balance of risks vs benefits for individual early
thrombus removal strategies are further discussed below.
Less rigorous evidence suggests that the optimal patient population includes patients with a first episode of
iliofemoral DVT of ⬍14 days in duration, having a reasonable life expectancy, and without a high risk of bleeding.
Recommendations regarding the optimal patient population are largely derived from one large, multicenter registry

thrombolysis.16 Among patients enrolled in the National
Venous Registry, those with chronic symptoms, femoropopliteal DVT, and symptoms ⬎10 days in duration had
significantly worse outcomes than those with a first episode
of acute iliofemoral DVT of ⬍10 days in duration. However, the 10-day interval of symptoms was arbitrary, and
symptom duration among those symptomatic for ⬎10 days
varied from days to many months.
Other guidelines have suggested that DVT associated
with symptoms present for ⱕ14 days be considered
acute,27 and a recently published randomized trial included
patients with symptoms of ⬍21 days.50 These recommendations contrast with the findings of our systematic review,19 which identified no relationship between the duration of symptoms before intervention and development of
the postthrombotic syndrome. On balance, recommendations for consideration of early thrombus removal strategies
in patients with symptoms of ⬍14 days of duration would
seem fairly secure. Although a benefit in patients with a
duration of symptoms of ⬎14 days cannot be excluded,
chronic thrombosis does appear to be associated with inferior results,16 and the relative benefits vs risks in such
patients should be considered on an individualized basis.
Given the options available for the treatment of acute
iliofemoral DVT, it is unlikely that all
