62,63 Initiating events likely involve altered shear
stress and mechanical stress forces on the endothelium
and its glycocalyx (a glycosaminoglycan on the surface
of endothelial cells); perturbations in nitric oxide production, in vasoactive substance release, and in the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1,
macrophage inﬂammatory protein 1b, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1, CD106), L-selectins and Eselectins, and ICAM-1, with recruitment of leukocytes
leading to leukocyte transmigration into the vein wall
and valve, set up an inﬂammatory cascade and production of several cytokines (transforming growth factor
[TGF]-b1, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-a, interleukin1) and increased expression of MMPs.48,60 In addition,
the endothelial glycocalyx is an important structure that
prevents leukocyte adhesion, inﬂammation, and thrombosis. However, altered shear stress and mechanical
forces on the vein wall cause leukocyte adhesion, and
inﬂammation leads to injury and loss of the glycocalyx.64,65 A key component of inﬂammation and in the
VLU is the expression of MMP and cytokines, which
have signiﬁcant effects on the vein wall and venous valve,
the endothelium, and probably the glycocalyx and surrounding tissues, including destruction of the dermis
with eventual skin changes and ulcer formation.48
MMPs can be released as a result of mechanical stretch
(and hence during conditions of venous hypertension)
and have signiﬁcant effects on the endothelium, venous
smooth muscle, and adventitia.66,67 MMPs have been
demonstrated in rat venous tissue to cause venous dilation by several mechanisms, including hyperpolarization
and inhibition of extracellular calcium mobilization,
which are tightly regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor
(HIF).68-70 In a study evaluating varicose veins in CVD
patients, it was determined that HIF-1a and HIF-2a
transcriptional factors were overexpressed compared
with control nonvaricose veins, suggesting that
