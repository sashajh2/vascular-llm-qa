 units and absence of radiation or administration of nephrotoxic contrast material with ultrasound
have made it the preferred technique for aneurysm
screening and surveillance.193-195 However, aneurysm
diameter measurements, whether through the use of
CT or ultrasound imaging, are most reliable and reproducible when standardized measurement techniques
are used and the maximum transverse dimension
measured orthogonal to the vessel axis is reported. Moreover, it is essential that ultrasound examination be
performed by a qualiﬁed individual skilled in vascular
imaging. For operative planning, CT remains an essential
tool, given its precision, reproducibility, resolution, capacity for complete anatomic examination, and data conversion into numerous reformatting and measurement
programs. Plain abdominal ﬁlms and catheter-based
digital subtraction angiography have low sensitivity for
the detection of AAA. The luminal contour of the aneurysmal aorta visualized by angiography may be obscured
by accumulated mural thrombus, particularly in the case
of larger aneurysms.
Ultrasound has become a mainstay of emergency
medical practice and is used with increasing accuracy
and facility in the differential diagnosis of abdominal
pain. High sensitivity and speciﬁcity have been reported
in detecting nonruptured aneurysms,195,196 and use
of bedside ultrasound signiﬁcantly reduces time to

diagnosis and treatment.197,198 However, regions of the
retroperitoneum may not be well visualized in nonfasting patients or those with ileus or excessive intestinal
gas.199
The accuracy of CT imaging for diagnosis of symptomatic and ruptured AAA has also improved because of
advances in coordinated timing and appropriate dosage
of contrast material as well as through the use of multidetector arrays and image postprocessing. Timed
boluses of contrast material greatly increase the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of CT imaging.200 With modern
equipment and imaging techniques, false-positive CT
interpretation is low,201 and radiographic ﬁndings of
rupture are well characterized.202
We recommend using ultrasound, when feasible, as the
preferred imaging modality for aneurysm screening and
surveillance.
