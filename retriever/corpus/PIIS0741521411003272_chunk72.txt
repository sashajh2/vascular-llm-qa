2% to 5%, superficial
phlebitis in 2.4% to 13%, swelling in 5% to 17.5%, hyperpigmentation in 1.2% to 3.3%, residual or recurrent varicose veins in 9.1% to 21.2%, and DVT in ⬍1%.174,210 In a
comparison between TIPP and stab phlebectomy, TIPP
revealed a difference in the number of incisions174 and in
the speed of the procedure.178,179 However, there was no
difference in bruising, cellulitis, and numbness at 1 to 2
weeks; nerve injury, residual veins, cosmesis score, and
overall satisfaction at 6 weeks; and cosmesis or recurrence at
6 and 12 months. A learning curve to determine just how
aggressive the surgeon can be during the procedure to
eliminate all veins while minimizing bruising and other
local complications has also been noted.211,212 These
reports, however, used an early-generation system,
higher oscillation speeds (800-1200 rpm), and minimal
tumescence.
With a newer-generation system and technical modifications incorporating a lower oscillation frequency (300-

500 rpm), a dermal punch drainage technique, secondary
tumescence with extensive flushing of residual hematoma
and residual venous tissue fragments, and an additional
tertiary subdermal tumescence phase, the results of powered phlebectomy have improved.213 The largest series214
using modified techniques included 339 patients with a
mean operative time of 19.7 minutes, and ⬎60% of cases
involving 10 to 20 incisions. Discoloration of the skin was
noted in eight patients (2.3%), excessive or hypertrophic
scarring in two (0.6%), and cellulitis in one (0.3%). There
were no significant hematomas and no recurrent varicose
veins at 12 weeks in this series, and overall,
