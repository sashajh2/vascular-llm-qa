3. Drugs and nutritional supplements
3.1. In symptomatic patients with varicose veins, who
are not candidates for intervention, who are waiting
for intervention or have symptoms after intervention,
we suggest micronized puriﬁed ﬂavonoid fraction
(MPFF) or Ruscus extracts for treatment of vein related
pain, leg heaviness and/or sensation of swelling.*
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
3.2. In symptomatic patients with varicose veins, who
are not candidates for intervention, who are waiting for
intervention or have symptoms after intervention, we
suggest hydroxyethylrutosides or calcium dobesilate or
horse chestnut extract or red vine leaf extract or sulodexide for treatment of vein-related pain, leg heaviness,
night cramps, and/or sensation of swelling.*
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low to very low)

Rationale. Venoactive drugs (VADs), also called phlebotropics or phlebotonics, have shown varying beneﬁts in
patients with chronic venous disorders. VADs have
been largely prescribed in Europe and other parts of
the world,101 but recently they have gained interest in
the United States, where they are available now, mainly
as nutritional supplements.102,103 The most frequently
used VADs include MPFF, diosmin, Ruscus extracts,
hydroxyethylrutosides, calcium dobesilate, horse chestnut extract/escin, and red vine leaf extract. Sulodexide
does not belong to the VAD family, but it has been used
for CVD (Table VI). Pentoxifylline is a vasoactive agent
that has been beneﬁcial in patients with claudication
