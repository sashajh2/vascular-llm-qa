operative follow-up.238 This technique has
a 91% accuracy in deﬁning hemodynamic status and
complications with little metallic artifact.239
Concerns about repeated radiation exposure have
prompted some to recommend duplex ultrasound as
an alternative surveillance technique.1,6,56,209 Contrastenhanced ultrasound is a less expensive and noninvasive
technique that has been shown to clearly identify ﬂow in
and around a metallic coil pack.240 Thus, contrastenhanced ultrasound may be optimal for long-term
surveillance.
Finally, digital subtraction angiography is the “gold
standard” for deﬁning reperfusion of the aneurysm sac.
However, this is typically reserved for cases in which reintervention of an enlarging aneurysm sac is
necessary.1,56,72
The frequency of surveillance imaging is not well established, but it is unlikely that aneurysm reperfusion will
occur if it is completely obliterated and thrombosed on
the ﬁrst postprocedural imaging study. As such, the value
of long-term surveillance after embolization is not justiﬁed. In addition, given the lack of clear association of
GDAA and PDAA with metachronous visceral aneurysms,
surveillance for the development of new visceral aneurysms is also not well established.
