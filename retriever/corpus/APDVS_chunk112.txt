Medical Management
Postoperative medical management will vary depending on the etiology of the acute limb
ischemia incident. If the cause was determined to be embolic, long term anticoagulation
with Vitamin K antagonists (VKA; e.g. warfarin a.k.a. “Coumadin”) or direct xa inhibitors
(e.g. apixaban a.k.a. “Eliquis,” rivaroxaban a.k.a. “Xarelto”) should be initiated. If the patient
was already on anticooagulation, the clinician should gain further insight into if and why a
dose was missed and how to prevent similar events from occurring again. If the cause was
thrombotic in nature, the patient should be counseled on starting best medical therapy with
an aspirin and statin. In both cases, patients should have timely follow up scheduled with their
vascular surgeon and primary care provider and smoking cessation should be encouraged.

Outcomes
 Patients with ALI tend to have poor long term morbidity and mortality outcomes
 Bypass for ALI is associated with increased rates of major limb loss (22.4%) and mortality
(20.9%) at 1 year compared to bypass for all other reasons. (Baril et al. 2013)
 In a single institutional retrospective study, the 5-year freedom from re-intervention rate
was 89.2%. The survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 87.9%, 75.2%, and 60.6%,
respectively. (Eliason et al. 2003)
