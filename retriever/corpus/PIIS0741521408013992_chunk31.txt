for faster maturation. Ligation or endovascular coiling of
side branches can also be delayed to a later date and
performed only if the autogenous access does not mature in
a timely basis.
In autogenous accesses originating from arteries
proximal to the radial, the arteriotomy should be limited
to a maximum length of 4 to 6 mm, using the smaller
anastomoses for those individuals at highest risk of developing steal-induced ischemia, such as those with diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial occlusive disease.
Also, the anastomosis is performed with a continuous
suture to prevent future increase of the anastomotic
surface area. These two maneuvers limit future increases
in flow through the autogenous access and decrease the
incidence of arterial steal. Although the role of exercise
to encourage early maturation of the autogenous access
is not supported by strong evidence, some access surgeons continue to ask patients to perform hand exercises
starting 24 to 48 hours postoperatively to increase blood
flow through the vein to encourage early maturation of
the access.

4. CLINICAL RECOMMENDATION: Choice of
arteriovenous access when a patient is not a
suitable candidate for forearm autogenous access
For patients who have exhausted all forearm veins
on both sides and, according to vein availability and
surgical expertise, are suitable candidates for either
forearm prosthetic access or upper arm access of any
type, we suggest that the surgeon offer both alternatives to patients (GRADE 2, very low-quality evidence).
4.1. Evidence
The systematic review by Murad et al14 identified only
2 studies that compared the autogenous upper arm access
with the prosthetic lower arm access (prosthetic looped
forearm access). One study showed that an
