 a prospective cohort study, Koroglu et al203
compared the effectiveness of endovenous laser ablation
and concomitant foam sclerotherapy in two groups of
patientsdone with isolated saphenous vein reﬂux (group
1; n ¼ 36 limbs) and one with saphenous vein reﬂux and
IPV (group 2; n ¼ 24 limbs); 21 of the 60 limbs had had C2
disease. Occlusion of the IPVs was identiﬁed in 75% postoperatively compared with 98.6% of saphenous veins.
Although no clinically signiﬁcant difference was found
in the VCSS between the two groups, the visual analog
scale score was more prominently decreased after treatment of isolated saphenous vein insufﬁciency. Their results suggest that the clinical outcomes will be superior
for patients with isolated truncal insufﬁciency.
van Neer et al,204 in their prospective study of 74 limbs
(55 class C2) of 59 patients with primary varicose veins,
evaluated the effects of high ligation and saphenous
stripping to just below the knee before and 6 months after the procedure. They found that reﬂux in the GSV
below the knee can persist in the main GSV trunk and
the anterior arch and posterior arch vein tributaries after
stripping. On multivariable analysis, the investigators
found no signiﬁcant association between the presence
of an IPV preoperatively and reﬂux in the GSV or its
branches below the knee postoperatively or between
the preoperative IPVs and postoperative visible varicose
veins. In addition, the diameter of the GSV below the
knee and its branches decreased signiﬁcantly after short
stripping of the more proximal GSV. The proportion of
patients with visible varicose veins in the GSV area below
the knee had decreased from 70% to 16% after stripping.
The investigators concluded that IPVs are not related to
the persistence of visible varicose veins below the knee
nor to the persistence of below-the-knee GSV reﬂux.
