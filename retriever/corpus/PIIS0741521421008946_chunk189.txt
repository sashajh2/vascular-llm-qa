 has not been deﬁnitely established and
thus, cannot be recommended owing to relatively small
sample sizes.
In addition, procedure-related subclinical microembolization is common and carotid stenting is associated with
a higher incidence of microembolization.382,638-641 The
cognitive impact of microembolization may be signiﬁcant, but the effects are difﬁcult to decipher.642-645
Although many studies show procedure-related microembolization is associated with deterioration in cognitive
domains after carotid revascularization procedures;
others do not.639,642-645 Owing to differing sizes of
embolic particles, locations of these micro-embolic lesions, it is challenging to select the appropriate cognitive
batteries to test the true cognitive impacts of embolic lesions.646 Studies have shown improved cognitive function despite an evidence of microembolization and
that size of emboli play a signiﬁcant role in neuronal
death and long-term cognitive outcomes.646,647
It is important to recognize that the conﬂuence of factors contributing to poorer vascular health may also
affect cognition, and many other factors may also
contribute to which patients experience procedurerelated cognitive changes. Baseline brain connectivity648
and inﬂammatory status649 have been shown to
contribute to cognitive changes following carotid interventions. Physical activity650,651 also contributes to cognitive health.

COST ANALYSIS OF CEA AND CAS
Although health insurance coverage has been
extended to millions of previously uninsured individuals
in the United States, out of pocket expenses have risen
more rapidly than at any time in our history. From 2004
through 2014, for example, deductibles increased by
256% and coinsurance has increased by 106%.652 As a
result, many healthcare facilities are asking patients to
pay out-of-pocket expenses up front.653 In fact, there is
evidence that many patients are delaying or foregoing
medical/surgical treatment because of out-of-pocket
costs.654 Massachusetts became the ﬁrst state in the
United States to require hospitals to post healthcare prices.655 Of particular relevance to vascular surgeons
