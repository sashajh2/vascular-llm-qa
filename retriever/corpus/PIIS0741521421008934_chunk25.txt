AR and CEA vs CEA alone (OR, 0.9; 95%
CI, 0.81-0.99; P ¼ .04).49 Although these studies appear
promising and have been supported by a clinical competency statement from the SVS,50 it is important to
remember that to date the vast majority of TCAR procedures have been performed in patients at high anatomic or
medical risk for CEA and the data at present are inadequate to make a recommendation on the role of TCAR
for low surgical risk patients with symptomatic carotid
stenosis. In summary, TCAR is superior or preferable to
TF-CAS or CEA for patients with high anatomic and/or
physiologic surgical risk (more detail provided in the
Implementation Document).
Recommendation 2.1.: We recommend CEA over TFCAS for low- and standard-risk patients with >50%
symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (grade IA).

symptomatic per protocol patients in both trials was
0.6% in each trial. No deaths occurred in the per protocol
symptomatic patients in ROADSTER-2 for a combined
30-day stroke and death rate of 0.6%.44,45 A more recent
study examined 3286 propensity-matched patients from
the VQI and demonstrated a signiﬁcantly lower incidence of in-hospital stroke and death for the patients
