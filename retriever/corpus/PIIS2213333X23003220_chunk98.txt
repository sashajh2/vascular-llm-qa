CO2-based
foam

Prospective
Visual disturbances CO2: 3.1% (4/128),
observational
Room air: 8.2% (4/49) (P ¼ .15). Chest
tightness (3.1% vs 18%), dry cough (1.6% vs study
16%), or dizziness (3.1% vs 12%) were lower
in the CO2 vs air groups (P < .02). The
proportion of patients with side effects
decreased from 39% (19/49) to 11% (14/128)
as CO2 replaced air for foam preparation
(P < .001).
