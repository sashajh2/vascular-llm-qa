specialty and volume on CEA perioperative outcomes
in a retrospective analysis of 953 CEA during a 2-year
period. Surgeons were classiﬁed into general surgeons,
cardiothoracic surgeons, and vascular surgeons, and their
volume was categorized into low volume (<10 CEAs),
medium volume (10 to <30 CEAs) and high volume
($30 CEAs). Perioperative stroke and death risk were
1.3%, 2.9%, and 4.1% for vascular surgeons, cardiothoracic
surgeons, and general surgeons, respectively (P ¼ .126). A
subgroup analysis showed that perioperative stroke risks
for asymptomatic patients were 0.7%, 3%, and 3.6% (P ¼
.099) and for symptomatic patients were 2.3%, 2.3%, and
5.3% (P ¼ .511) for vascular surgeons, cardiothoracic surgeons, and general surgeons, respectively. Perioperative
stroke risks were higher for nonvascular surgeons

(general surgeons and cardiothoracic surgeons combined) vs vascular surgeons in asymptomatic patients
(3.2% vs 0.7%; P ¼ .033). Additionally, perioperative
stroke/death was also signiﬁcantly lower for highvolume surgeons: 1.3% vs 4.1% and 4.3% for mediumand low-volume surgeons (P ¼ .019) (1.3% vs 4.15% for
high vs low/medium combined; P ¼ .005). A univariate
logistic analysis showed that the OR of having a perioperative stroke was 0.4 (95% CI, 0.16-1.07; P ¼ .069) for
vascular surgeons vs cardiothoracic surgeons and general surgeons, 0.3 for high-volume surgeons vs low-/medium-volume surgeons (95% CI, 0.1-0.7; P ¼ .008), and
0.2 (95% CI, 0.06-0.45; P ¼ .0004) when patching was
used. A multivariate
