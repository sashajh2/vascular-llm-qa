forating venous systems, there have been deﬁciencies
in the past in nomenclature for speciﬁc veins in the leg
within each system. In response to variability in
anatomic terminology used for venous anatomy, standard anatomic venous terminology has been developed
and adopted. For practitioners caring for patients with
VLUs, correct standardized venous nomenclature
should be used as deﬁned by the 2002 International
Consensus Committee on Venous Anatomical Terminology and updated in 2005 as shown in Table II and
Table III.38,39

Guideline 2.2: Venous Leg Ulcer Pathophysiology
We recommend a basic practical knowledge of
venous physiology and venous leg ulcer pathophysiology for all practitioners caring for venous leg ulcers.
[BEST PRACTICE]
Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a debilitating condition that affects millions of individuals worldwide. The
condition can result in varicose veins or advance to severe
skin changes and VLU. Both reﬂux and obstruction account for the pathophysiologic mechanism of CVD;
