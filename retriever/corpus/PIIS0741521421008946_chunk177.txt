CI, 1.0-2.3) compared with vascular surgeons (2.9%). Patients who underwent CAS by radiologists and neurosurgeons experienced similar 30-day stroke or death risk
(8% vs 7.9%, respectively; adjusted OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.71.7; P ¼ .79).575

CAS volume. Several prospective multicenter studies
evaluated operator experience to determine if it predicts
outcomes after CAS, yielding mixed results.5,198,576-580
The Carotid ACCULINK/ACCUNET Post Approval Trial to
Uncover Rare Events (CAPTURE 2) Study which included
5297 patients and CHOICE (Evaluating Outcomes
Through the Collection of Clinical Evidence) Study of
5841 patients both showed that physician experience
impacted CAS outcomes.577,580 However, neither the
CABANA (Carotid Stenting Boston Scientiﬁc Surveillance
Program) Study of 1025 patients nor the CAPTURE Study
of 3500 patients found that operator experience affected
outcomes.198,578 The CHOICE Study found that increased
time interval between the ﬁrst CAS and subsequent CAS
procedures was the only independent predictor of 30day perioperative stroke, death, and MI after CAS.580
The CAPTURE 2 Study showed an inverse relationship
between operator volume and adverse events.577 Other
studies used regional and national database to evaluate
if annual CAS volume impacts outcome and demonstrated decreased complication risk when CAS was performed by high-volume surgeons.205,581,582 However, a
study of 4001 CAS procedures by Steppacher et al583 did
not show a difference in in-patient stroke/death risk

based on operator volume. However physician categories
were deﬁned as low (<10 cases/year), medium (9-23
cases/year) and high (>23 cases/year), although other
studies deﬁned this factor differently.
