770.89).39,41 Consensus ultrasound criteria for diagnosing
varying degrees of carotid artery stenosis have been
extensively developed, widely used and validated.42 Yet,
duplex criteria that are used to categorize degree of
stenosis can vary widely across centers, thereby impacting treatment decisions.43,44 Duplex ultrasound examination may have a lower sensitivity and speciﬁcity for
diagnosis of more moderate degrees of stenosis (50%69%).40 Duplex ultrasound examination also has the
ability to evaluate features of plaque morphology that
may indicate patients at a high risk of stroke.38
Many surgeons use carotid duplex ultrasound examination as the primary and sole mode of imaging before
planning and performing CEA.45 These patients should
have no evidence of arch disease on clinical examination
(equal arm blood pressure), no abnormal waveform suggesting inﬂow as noticed by low peak systolic velocities
or outﬂow disease as noted by low/absent diastolic ﬂow
and absence of extensive tortuosity, which may falsely
elevate peak systolic velocities. This practice is in contrast
with planning for carotid stenting procedures (CAS), for
which additional imaging of the aortic arch and great
vessels is typically considered mandatory.
The determination of the degree of carotid stenosis is
based on analysis of hemodynamic parameters obtained
from Doppler analysis, including peak systolic and end
diastolic velocities. Ultrasound criteria describing the degree of carotid stenosis should be deﬁned on angiographic/imaging correlation in each vascular laboratory.
The most common consensus criteria include a cutoff
peak systolic velocity of the ICA of 125 cm/second or
greater to denote an angiographic stenosis of greater

than 50%. A combination of peak systolic velocity of
230 cm/second and an end-diastolic velocity of greater
than100 cm/second, or a peak systolic velocity ratio between the internal and CCA of greater than 4 can be
used to predict a stenosis of greater than 70%.42,46 Using
these criteria, the reported sensitivity, speciﬁcity and accuracy of duplex in predicting 50% to 69% or a
