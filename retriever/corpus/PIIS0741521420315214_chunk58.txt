 syndrome or rhabdomyolysis. In cases in
which a large sheath must be left in place for a prolonged time, it can be withdrawn into the external iliac
artery to allow antegrade ﬂow into the ipsilateral internal
iliac artery. Meticulous postoperative vigilance to detect
inadequate lower extremity perfusion or compartment
syndrome should be routine. Level of recommendation:

Recommendation for coverage or occlusion of the CA
during TEVAR
TAA treated by TEVAR may require coverage of the CA
in about 4% to 6% of cases.89,165 This can add 1 to 2.5 cm
or more of aorta to obtain a distal seal. In addition, the CA
is stenotic in approximately 20% of patients, most of
these being asymptomatic, presumably because of
collateral mesenteric ﬂow.166-168 Collaterals generally
arise from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and
can be evaluated by selective SMA arteriography. Collateral pathways can also be identiﬁed using highresolution CTA reconstructions (ideally 1-mm cuts or
smaller, 16-slice or greater), and the anatomic correlations have been well described.169 In 94 cases of celiac
stenosis (13 with aberrant hepatic artery origins), 95%
had collateral ﬂow from the pancreaticoduodenal and
75% from the dorsal pancreatic arteries. These were
similar in cases in which the hepatic arteries originated

from the SMA (92% and 77%, respectively). In addition,
ﬂow from the left and right gastric arteries to the hepatic
arteries has been documented.169 Examples of CTArelevant ﬁndings that are important to note if CA
coverage is planned include signiﬁcant stenosis of the
SMA, occluded inferior mesenteric artery, large poststenotic dilation of the CA, and inability to visualize the
pancreaticoduodenal or dorsal pancreatic branches.
CTA alone may predict ischemia after CA coverage and
