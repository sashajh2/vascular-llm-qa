treatment strategies. Because it must be descriptive and
predictive, a key guiding principle in developing an
improved classiﬁcation of chronic ischemia and the threatened limb is that disease stages should correlate with their
natural history or risk of major amputation if treated
conservatively. It is our expressed purpose to refocus the
approach to the patient with a threatened limb and
a component of chronic ischemia according to disease
severity rather than arterial lesion characteristics.
There are two major problems with current classiﬁcation systems: (1) the validity and natural history of the
concept of CLI, and (2) the failure of most existing systems
to assess and grade the major factors that inﬂuence both
risk of limb loss and clinical management.
As presently deﬁned, CLI is associated with decreased
quality of life, increased risk for amputation, and increased
mortality. The 5-year mortality for CLI patients is 50% to
60%, with coronary events and strokes accounting for at
least 70% of the deaths.2-7 However, efforts to understand
the natural history and compare outcomes of alternative
therapies have been hindered by inconsistencies in the deﬁnition and the heterogeneity of clinical presentation.
The term CLI implies that a speciﬁc cutoff value exists
below which limb perfusion is inadequate and that without
revascularization, the limb will inevitably be lost. The precise
level of perfusion deﬁcit that deﬁnes “critical ischemia” is
unclear. There have been minor modiﬁcations of the original proposed hemodynamic cutoff measurements, with
Rutherford Classiﬁcation,8 the TransAtlantic Inter-Society
Consensus (TASC),9 and the European Consensus10 statements proposing similar deﬁnitions for CLI based on the
presence or absence of tissue necrosis, with the addition of
toe pressure (TP) and transcutaneous oxygen measurements
(TcPO2). AP criteria range from <40 to 70 mm Hg with TP
and TcPO2 <30 to 50 mm Hg; lower values are required for
patients with rest pain, and higher
