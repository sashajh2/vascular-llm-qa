-month trial of
compression stockings before intervention for patients with
C2 disease, required by some Insurance companies.
Compression therapy was found to be inferior to minimally
invasive endovenous therapies (including UGFS and
endovenous thermal ablation) that produce better results
with regards to anatomical disease extent, patient
satisfaction and QOL.

Probably no

How substantial are the
undesirable anticipated
effects?

Reported side effects of discomfort, appearance, and
application difﬁculty. The beneﬁts of stockings were offset
by highly variable reports of compliance, presumably due to
the most common side effects of itching and irritation.

Probably yes

Do the desirable effects
outweigh the undesirable
effects?

Probably

Probably yes

What is the overall certainty of
the evidence of effects?

Low with practically no data

Low

How large are the resource
requirements associated
with the intervention?

No available data

Unknown

How large is the incremental
cost relative to the net
beneﬁt?

Compression therapy was found to be inferior to minimally
invasive endovenous therapies (including UGFS and
endovenous thermal ablation) that produce better results
with regards to cost effectiveness.

Unknown

What would be the effect on
health inequalities?

None

None

Is the opinion acceptable to
key stakeholders?

No data available

Probably yes

Is the opinion feasible to
implement?

Yes

Yes

UGFS, Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy; QOL, quality of life.

Consensus statement
11.1.4. In patients who are symptomatic following
thermal or nonthermal ablation, we recommend early
DUS to exclude ARTE or DVT.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence A (high)
Rationale. Based on early reports of a high incidence
of thrombus extension at the SFJ232 (endothermal heat
induced thrombosis [EHIT]) following thermal ablation
of the GSV as well as ready access to ultrasound in
most venous clinics, screening for EHIT and DVT with
early DUS has become a common practice. EHIT is
commonly classiﬁed as thrombus extension to the AFJ
ort SPJ (I), involvement of <50% of the deep venous
lumen (II), involvement of >5
