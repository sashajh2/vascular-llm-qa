Note
By the end of this chapter, students will:
 Review abdominal aortic anatomy and aneurysm pathophysiology.
 Recognize history, physical exam, and radiologic findings typical of patients presenting with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
 Identify indications for intervention on abdominal aortic aneurysms and the
evidence-based foundation for these recommendations.
 Describe the basic procedural steps of both an endovascular and an open surgical
approach for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
 Delineate appropriate surveillance
