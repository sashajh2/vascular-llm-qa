In a patient with unilateral iliofemoral venous occlusion/severe stenosis with recalcitrant venous leg ulcer for whom attempts at endovascular reconstruction
have failed, we suggest open surgical bypass with use
of saphenous vein as a cross-pubic bypass (Palma procedure) to aid in venous ulcer healing and to prevent
recurrence. A synthetic graft is an alternative in the
absence of autogenous tissue. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL
OF EVIDENCE - C]
A number of case series report experiences with the crosspubic bypass, a femoral vein to femoral vein bypass with use of
autogenous vein. Patency has been based on clinical outcome
and not objective assessment in earlier series, whereas more
recent case series using venography or duplex ultrasonography to assess patency report 5-year secondary patency rates
of w75%. Risk factors for suboptimal outcomes include the
low pressure in the venous system, a small saphenous vein
(<5 mm), and technical imperfections such as kinking of
the graft. A prosthetic bypass for venous obstruction is a
salvage procedure when endovenous stenting or venous
bypass is not feasible. Lower overall patency rates than with
a Palma procedure can be expected.371,431,434-436

With Recalcitrant Venous UlcerdAdjunctive Arteriovenous Fistula
For those patients who would beneﬁt from an open
venous bypass, we suggest the addition of an adjunctive
arteriovenous ﬁstula (4-6 mm in size) as an adjunct to
improve inﬂow into autologous or prosthetic crossover
bypasses when the inﬂow is judged to be poor to aid in
venous leg ulcer healing and to prevent recurrence.
