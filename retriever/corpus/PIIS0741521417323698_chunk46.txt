D is an independent predictor of
mortality after open repair,34,109 with the severity of
pulmonary disease and the capacity to optimize preoperative respiratory function inﬂuencing outcome.110 EVAR
is better tolerated than OSR, particularly if EVAR is
performed under local anesthesia.111,112 However, patients
with severe COPD exhibit increased in-hospital mortality,
pulmonary complications, major adverse events, and
decreased 5-year survival whether they are treated with
open repair or EVAR.90
If COPD is suspected or present, room air arterial blood
gas determinations and standard pulmonary function
testing should be performed before surgery. In the
setting of oxygen-dependent COPD, pulmonary consultation should be obtained for assessment of prognosis
and optimization of medical therapy. Smoking cessation
before aneurysm repair and administration of pulmonary
bronchodilators for at least 2 weeks are recommended.
The diagnosis of an aortic aneurysm can be a strong
motivator for smoking cessation,113 and efforts to begin
smoking cessation before surgery can result in longterm beneﬁts.114 Nicotine replacement115 and use of
nortriptyline and bupropion, alone or in combination,
along with inpatient and outpatient counseling have
proven beneﬁcial for smoking cessation.116
We suggest preoperative pulmonary function studies, including
room air arterial blood gas determinations, in patients with a
history of symptomatic COPD, long-standing tobacco use, or
inability to climb one ﬂight of stairs.
