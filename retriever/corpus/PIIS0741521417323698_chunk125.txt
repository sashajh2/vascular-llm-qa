patients undergoing OSR of an aortic aneurysm.582
However, multiple randomized trials have shown no
measurable beneﬁt to the routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in nonselected patients.583-586 Whereas
transesophageal echocardiography is useful for those
patients “at risk” of major hemodynamic instability or in
the unstable patient to assess volume status and cardiac
function, routine use does not inﬂuence clinical
outcomes.587,588
Perioperative MI is associated with adverse short- and
long-term outcomes and can be prevented by early
recognition of myocardial ischemia.589-592 Electrocardiographic monitoring, using ﬁve leads, is recommended for
both OSR and EVAR. Continuous 12-lead ECG or the
monitoring of two leads instead of a single precordial
lead has been shown to be a more sensitive indicator
of myocardial ischemia.593 However, myocardial
ischemia detection by transesophageal echocardiography in the form of wall motion abnormalities precedes
ST-segment changes and is a more sensitive monitor
for ischemia. Whereas troponin measurement after
vascular surgery has been advocated,594 routine
measurement has not been associated with improved
clinical outcomes.586

We suggest using pulmonary artery catheters only if the
likelihood of a major hemodynamic disturbance is high.
