Recommendation 6: We recommend that patients who undergo OPAR or EPAR should be followed up using clinical examination, ankle
brachial index (ABI), and DUS at 3, 6, and 12 months during the Ô¨Årst postoperative year and, if stable, annually thereafter. In addition to
DUS evaluation of the repair, the aneurysm sac should be evaluated for evidence of enlargement. If abnormalities are found on clinical
examination, ABI, or DUS, appropriate clinical management according to the lower extremity endovascular or open bypass guidelines
should be undertaken (grade 1B). If compressive symptoms or symptomatic aneurysm sac expansion are noted, we suggest surgical
decompression of the aneurysm sac (grade 1C)
