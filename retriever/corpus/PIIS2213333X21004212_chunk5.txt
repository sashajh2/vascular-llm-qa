 using DUS compared with other diagnostic test modalities
such as physical examination, complemented by plethysmography, computed tomography scan or MR imaging,
venogram, and hand-held Doppler (HHD). We also studied treatment modalities separately in patients with varicose veins (CEAP class 2-6) and compared the outcomes
of different procedures. The procedures included open
surgery (high ligation and stripping [HL/S], saphenectomy,
or conventional surgery), endovenous ablation techniques
including thermal ablation with endovenous laser therapy
(EVLT) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and nonthermal
ablations, including cyanoacrylate closure (CAC), mechanochemical ablation (MOCA), ultrasound-guided foam
sclerotherapy (UGFS), physician compounded foam
sclerotherapy, or commercially produced foam sclerotherapy. We also studied patients (only CEAP class C2)
who underwent ablation of incompetent perforating
veins. We included studies that enrolled at least 85% of
the population of interest (ie, if 85% of the population of
the study ﬁts the question of the systematic review, for
example, they had C2-C6 varicose veins, we included
such study).
We included studies that measured outcomes of superﬁcial axial vein incompetence (retrograde ﬂow in the GSV
of >500 ms), pain, generic and disease-speciﬁc QoL,
neurologic complications, anatomic closure, recurrent
varicosity, recurrent incompetence, patient satisfaction,
and procedure-related adverse events (AEs), including
serious AEs including death, pulmonary embolism,
deep vein thrombosis (DVT), myocardial infarction,
stroke, transient ischemic attack, visual symptoms,
generalized allergy, anaphylaxis, hemorrhage requiring
transfusion or surgery, severe pain, severe neuralgia,
endovenous heat-induced thrombosis III or IV, readmission, and others. We recorded and analyzed minor AEs
including pain (tenderness, medial thigh pain, and
discomfort), access site complications (infection, skin necrosis, skin burn), superﬁcial thrombophlebitis (GSV
thrombosis, “saccular” thrombosis), p
