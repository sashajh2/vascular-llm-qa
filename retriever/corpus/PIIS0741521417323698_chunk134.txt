ak include a patent IMA,
number and diameter of patent lumbar arteries (especially L3 and L4 lumbar arteries), and ongoing anticoagulation.652-655
The fate of persistent type II endoleaks is variable. Aneurysm sac size may decrease in up to 25%,649,656 remain stable in 50% to 70%,657 or increase in up to 25% of patients.
The delayed onset of a type II endoleak may also be noted
6 months or later after EVAR. A delayed type II endoleak
may be associated with aneurysm sac expansion658; however, expansion in sac diameter >10 mm is uncommon.659
Treatment of a type II endoleak includes embolization of
the IMA or lumbar arteries with coils or glue,646 direct
translumbar injection of the aneurysm sac,639 transcaval
embolization,660,661 and laparoscopic ligation of the IMA
and lumbar arteries,662 all with variable success rates. Up
to 60% of treated aneurysms continue to expand,
requiring multiple procedures and in some cases explantation with conversion to open repair.663,664 Stent graft
preservation with oversewing of the IMA and lumbar arteries from within the sac has been reported.665-667 Type
II endoleak remains a challenge to treat effectively.668
Rupture from a type II endoleak is rare and more often
related to an unrecognized type I endoleak. The decision
to treat is based on the size and expansion ($5 mm) of
the aneurysm, the type and size of patent inﬂow and
outﬂow vessels, and the presence of symptoms.669,670
Selective intervention appears both safe and costeffective.659,671

Type III endoleak. A type III endoleak occurs when
there is incomplete seal between components or
component separation and less frequently is due to fabric erosion. The aneurysm
