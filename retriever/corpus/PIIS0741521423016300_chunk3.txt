Diagnosis

Recommendation

1. In a person with diabetes without a foot ulcer, take a relevant
history for peripheral artery disease, examine the foot for signs of
ischaemia and palpate the foot pulses at least annually, or with
any change in clinical status of the feet.
2. In a person with diabetes without a foot ulcer, if peripheral artery
disease (PAD) is suspected, consider performing pedal Doppler
waveforms in combination with ankle brachial index (ABI) and
toe brachial index (TBI). No single modality has been shown to be
optimal for the diagnosis of PAD and there is no value above
which PAD can be excluded. However, PAD is less likely in the
presence of ABI 0.9 e 1.3; TBI $ 0.70; and triphasic or biphasic
pedal Doppler waveforms.
3. In a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene, take a
relevant history for peripheral artery disease, examine the person
for signs of ischaemia and palpate the foot pulses.
4. In a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene, evaluate
pedal Doppler waveforms in combination with ankle brachial
index (ABI) and toe brachial index (TBI) measurements to identify
the presence of peripheral artery disease (PAD).
No single modality has been shown to be optimal for the diagnosis
of PAD, and there is no value above which PAD can be excluded.
However, PAD is less likely in the presence of ABI 0.9 e 1.3; TBI $
0.
