 (Strong), Quality
of Evidence: B (Moderate).
2.1: We recommend repair of all true SMAAs and pseudoaneurysms as soon as the diagnosis is made regardless
of size. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: A (High).
2.2: We suggest careful observation of SMAA because of
dissection unless refractory symptoms develop. Level of
Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence:
B (Moderate).
3.1: We recommend an endovascular-ﬁrst approach to all
SMAAs if it is anatomically feasible. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
4.1: We suggest abdominal axial imaging to screen for
concomitant intra-abdominal aneurysms in patients
who did not have CTA at the time of diagnosis. Level of
Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence:
B (Moderate).
5.1: We suggest annual CTA to observe postsurgical patients. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
Jejunal, ileal, and colic artery aneurysms. 1.1: In patients
who are thought to have jejunal artery, ileal artery, and
colic artery aneurysms, we recommend computed tomography angiography (CTA) as the diagnostic tool of
choice. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
1.2: In patients with high radiation exposure risks or
renal insufﬁciency, we recommend non-contrastenhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for
diagnosis. Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
Technical remark: Non-contrast-enhanced MRA is best
suited to children and women of childbearing potential
or those who have contraindications to CTA or MRA

contrast materials (ie, pregnancy, renal insufﬁciency, or
gadolinium contrast material allergy).
1.3: We recommend the use of catheter-based angiography for all emergent cases presenting with rupture,
Level of Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality
of Evidence: B (Moderate), and electively for preoperative planning
