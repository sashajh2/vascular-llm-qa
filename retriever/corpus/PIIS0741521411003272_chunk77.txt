 uncertain or unknown.215 In a study of 279
limbs with recurrent varicose veins at the groin, Geier et
al223 found a long residual saphenofemoral stump in about
two-thirds of cases, recurrences became apparent after a
mean time interval of 6.3 years, and symptoms occurred
after a mean of 8.5 years.
Evaluation. Treatment of symptomatic recurrent varicose veins should be performed after careful evaluation of
the patient with duplex scanning to assess the etiology,
source, type, and extent of recurrent varicose veins. Sites of
reflux at the SFJ or saphenopopliteal junction and at the
sites of clinically important perforating veins should be
searched. Duplex scanning is excellent in identifying residual saphenous stumps, but it has a sensitivity of 62% and a
positive predictive value of only 26% to identify correctly
the presence of neovascularization.224 Histologic examination is still the gold standard when trying to differentiate
between different types of groin recurrences. If perineal or
medial thigh varicosity suggests pelvic reflux, evaluation
with transvaginal ultrasonography may be used, although
the gonadal and pelvic veins are best evaluated with MR or
contrast venography.225,226
Techniques and results of treatment. Ambulatory
phlebectomy, sclerotherapy, or endovenous thermal ablation of accessory saphenous or perforating veins can be
performed, depending on the source, location, and extent
of recurrence. Conventional open surgery usually involves
repeat disconnection of the SFJ combined with ambulatory
phlebectomy. The SEPS procedure to treat incompetent
perforating veins in patients with advanced disease (class
C5-C6) can be useful. Endovenous thermal ablation can
also be performed to treat persistent great, small, or accessory saphenous veins or perforators, and foam sclerotherapy
has been used successfully, alone or with phlebectomy, to
treat recurrent varicose veins and perforating veins.227
Phlebectomy alone, without repeat ligation of the saphenous stump, was studied by Pittaluga et al228 for treatment of
