used worldwide but is not FDA approved in the United
States. Pentoxifylline was initially developed to treat PAD
and has been used off label in VLUs. It has a powerful
inhibitory effect on cytokine-mediated neutrophil activation, white cell adhesion to endothelium, and oxidative
stress.484 In nine RCTs (eight vs placebo) including a total

improved ulcer healing with a relative risk ratio compared
with placebo of 1.4 [95% CI, 1.19-1.66].477
Guideline 7.3: Physiotherapy
We suggest supervised active exercise to improve
muscle pump function and to reduce pain and edema
in patients with venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
The goal of physiotherapy in treating VLUs is to
decrease venous pressure and edema. This can be achieved
through activation of the calf muscle pump by speciﬁc exercises of the ankle or by biomechanical stimulation of the
calf muscle pump. Lifestyle changes and a medical program
of speciﬁc exercises (individual or in group) can improve
both calf muscle function and ankle mobility. The
improved function of the calf muscle pump results in
both improved ejection fraction and residual volume of
the venous reservoir. VLU patients showed signiﬁcantly
reduced values of ankle range of motion, walking speed
and endurance, self-perceived exertion, mobility, and physical activity level.485-487 A recent literature review that studied the importance of lifestyle changes and self-care
activities in preventing recurrence of VLUs identiﬁed 16
studies. This review concluded that there is some evidence
to support a beneﬁcial impact of increased physical activity,
improved mobility, and foot exercises on lowering recurrence.488 A Dutch RCT investigated the effectiveness of
the Lively Leg self-management program and showed a
