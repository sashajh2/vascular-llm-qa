 determine clinical or economic
outcomes, the frequency of application remains at the
discretion of the clinician. Current clinical practice has
included application of grafts followed by a period of 1
to 3 weeks of observation to determine effectiveness before
reapplication is considered.
Guideline 4.23: Tissue Matrices, Human Tissues,
or Other Skin Substitutes
We suggest the use of a porcine small intestinal submucosa tissue construct in addition to compression
therapy for the treatment of venous leg ulcers that
have failed to show signs of healing after standard therapy for 4 to 6 weeks. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Numerous tissue constructs are available for use in
chronic wounds that employ either human tissue (amniotic
membrane, cryopreserved skin) or animal tissue (bladder,
fetal bovine skin, others). Some are reported to contain
active growth factors or other attributes that might be
beneﬁcial to healing of VLUs.262 Of the multitude of
such products currently marketed, only porcine small intestinal submucosa has prospective RCT data supporting its
use to accelerate VLU closure.263
Guideline 4.24: Negative Pressure Therapy
We suggest against routine primary use of negative
pressure wound therapy for venous leg ulcers.
[GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
There is currently not enough information to support
the primary use of negative pressure wound therapy for
VLUs. Evidence supports positive effects with the use of
negative pressure therapy for wound healing in general.
Tissue granulation, area and volume reduction, and reductions in bioburden have all been reported. There have been

few studies speciﬁcally studying negative pressure therapy
for VLUs, with most studies reporting on mixed wound
causes.264 There has been an increase in the use of negative
pressure wound therapy for wound bed preparation to
augment skin graft healing.265
Guideline 4.25: Electrical Stimulation
We suggest against electrical stimulation therapy
for venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
There is theoretical, preclinical, and limited clinical
