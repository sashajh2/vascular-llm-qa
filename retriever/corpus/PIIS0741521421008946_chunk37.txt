10,46 patients undergoing vascular surgerydincluding 5264 undergoing CEAdthere was no difference in the risk of
bleeding complications among patients on aspirin, clopidogrel, or dual aspirin þ clopidogrel therapy, or no
antiplatelet therapy.165 Clearly, among those patients
with a speciﬁc indication for clopidogrel such as symptomatic carotid disease or recent stent placement, dual
antiplatelet therapy is indicated. Intraoperative anticoagulation, and protamine reversal, is discussed in Section on Anticoagulation and protamine reversal.
Carotid stenting. Perioperative medical management
of CAS patients is similar to those undergoing CEA,
including blood pressure control and beta blocker use.
Similarly, although there is currently no Level 1 evidence
to inform on the efﬁcacy of statins among patients undergoing CAS, individual case series support this
approach. For example, in a series of 180 patients undergoing CAS, the 30-day risk of stroke, death, and MI was
4% among statin users vs 15% among nonusers (P <
.05).94 In another series of 344 CAS patients, multivariate
analysis demonstrated that statin use was a signiﬁcant
predictor of reduced peri-interventional incidence of
ischemic stroke, MI, or death (OR, 0.31; P ¼ .006).95
Further, in the largest series reported to dated1083 patients undergoing CASdmultivariable analysis showed

that statin use was associated with a reduction in the
incidence of perioperative stroke and death (OR, 0.327,
95% CI, 0.13-0.80; P ¼ .016).96
With respect to antiplatelet therapy, there also are no
randomized clinical trials assessing the beneﬁt of aspirin
vs dual therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel for patients
undergoing CAS. Current recommendations are therefore largely based on experience with coronary artery
stents. Dual antiplatelet therapy including aspirin
(325 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg) should be initiated
before CAS, and continued for 4 weeks after the
