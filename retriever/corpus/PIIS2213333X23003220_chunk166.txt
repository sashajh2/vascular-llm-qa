 simple compression techniques to control severe bleeding.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. The true incidence of bleeding from varicose
veins is unknown due to under-reporting but appears to
occur in approximately 4% of patients presenting with
varicose veins.264,265 Bleeding often arises from small
veins at the ankle with surrounding skin pigmentation
and induration or following exacerbation of a venous
ulcer leading to erosion of veins underlying the ulcer
bed.266 Patients may report bleeding when the varicosities are exposed to warm water (in the shower or bathing), causing the veins to vasodilate, or bleeding can
occur because of minor trauma. Patients with right heart
failure or cardiomyopathy may also experience intermittent, often heavy, bleeding from dilated veins.
Regardless of the cause, when a varicose vein ruptures,
profuse bleeding can occur due to associated venous
hypertension.
Although most bleeding associated with varicose veins
is not associated with hypotension and does not require
transfusion,267 fatal hemorrhage is an uncommon, but
not entirely rare event.266 Most cases of fatal variceal
hemorrhage have come from autopsy reports. A 2011
report documented <100 fatalities over several decades.268 Twenty-three fatalities were reported in England and Wales in 2001.266 A systematic review
including 17 articles found that deaths secondary to
bleeding varicose veins accounted for 0.01% of autopsy
cases.269 The victims were patients aged 60 to $90 years
of age with no gender discrimination. Deaths due to
hemorrhage occurred in older persons who lived alone,
were mobility impaired, had skin fragility or an ulcer
located near the malleolus, were on anticoagulation or
antiplatelet medication, or had a comorbidity such as
dementia or liver failure. These rare case reports describe
pulsatile bleeding both from the thin-wall veins themselves and from exposed veins in a venous ulcer bed
leading to hypovolemic shock and death, especially in
the presence of ischemic heart disease.270 Another
single-center study found that patients with bleeding
episodes had decreased access to basic ﬁrst aid or hemorrh
