Outcomes and Surveillance
Asymptomatic carotid stenosis
 The historically touted Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) demonstrated that patients with >60% carotid stenosis who underwent CEA benefited significantly from stroke risk reduction at 5 years (5.1% for CEA vs. 11% for optimal medical
therapy consisting of aspirin alone).
 More recent studies suggest that with the current optimal medical management, which
consists of antiplatelet medication and statin therapy, 5-year stroke risk is highest in
patients with >70% carotid stenosis, and therefore this patient population would benefit
from carotid endarterectomy.
 Patients who are deemed high risk, either due to an anatomic (such as surgically inaccessible bifurcation or restenosis after previous CEA) or physiologic findings (congestive
heart failure, severe coronary artery disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease),
may be considered for TCAR given the equivocal results of perioperative stroke or death
at 1.3%, as compared to CEA.

 Asymptomatic patients with significant risk factors found to have moderate stenoses
(50%-79%) should be followed every 6-months to detect disease progression. High risk
patients with <50% stenosis can be followed-up annually.

Symptomatic carotid stenosis
 Patients who have >50% carotid stenosis and have developed symptoms of TIA or stroke
were found to benefit from CEA in the pivotal North American Symptomatic Carotid
Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) because of the significant 2-year stroke risk reduction
as compared to optimal medical management (15.7% vs. 22.2%.). An even greater stroke
risk reduction was seen in patients with >70% carotid stenosis (9% CEA vs. 26% medical
management).
 Current management of patients with symptomatic >50% carotid stenosis who are
low/standard risk is carotid endarterectomy over transfemoral carotid stenting (TFCAS),
as there are no studies to date which have shown benefit of TFCAS.
