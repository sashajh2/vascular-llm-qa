 each section and in the comments to
each speciﬁc recommendation, we have attempted to
clearly link the recommendation to the evidence and its
quality and to point out where consensus techniques
have been used. Independent review of GRADE assignments made by the Venous Ulcer Guidelines Committee
was also performed by the Knowledge and Evaluations
Research Unit at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minn) to
corroborate proper strength of evidence and quality of evidence for each guideline.
The ﬁnal document was reviewed by the chairman and
vice chairman of the Venous Ulcer Guidelines Committee
and remitted to the entire committee for concurrence.
Additional independent review was obtained from selected
reviewers representing multiple medical specialties vested in
venous ulcer management. The ﬁnal document was then
reviewed and approved by the SVS Document Oversight
Committee and approved by the Executive Committees
of the SVS and AVF.

Guideline 1.1: Venous Leg Ulcer Deﬁnition
We suggest use of a standard deﬁnition of venous

[BEST PRACTICE]

Inherent in composing a set of guidelines for VLU is
agreeing on a common deﬁnition of VLU. Current deﬁnitions for VLU vary, as exempliﬁed by the following:
THE AVF CONSENSUS STATEMENT: Venous ulcer is deﬁned as a full-thickness defect of skin, most frequently
in ankle region, that fails to heal spontaneously and is sustained by CVD (duplex studies).35
d SCOTTISH GUIDELINE DEFINITION: Chronic
venous leg ulcer is deﬁned as an open lesion between the
knee and the ankle joint that remains unhealed for at least
four weeks and occurs in the presence of venous disease.
Studies reviewed in this guideline included patients with
venous leg ulcers, irrespective of the method of diagnosis of
venous reﬂux.36

HEALTHCARE SYSTEM GUIDELINES: A pure venous ulcer is deﬁned, by professional
agreement,
