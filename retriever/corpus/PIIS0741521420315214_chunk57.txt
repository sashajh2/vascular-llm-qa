Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low)
Recommendation 25: We suggest the use of on-table
mapping software options on ﬁxed-imaging X-ray systems, such as roadmapping and CT fusion or overlay

reference, to aid in locating target landing sites and to
minimize need for repeated injections. If available, CT
overlay capability is extremely useful, especially in cases
in which location and cannulation of branches will be
needed. Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Implementation remark
In high-risk patients, placing and leaving wires, catheters, or sheaths in aortic branches can mark the location
of target branches and minimize the need for repeated
contrast angiography. A marker catheter may be
inserted through a small-diameter left brachial artery
sheath, for example, to mark the location of the LSA, or
a wire or catheter placed in the CA to mark its location
regardless of aortic or thoracic motion. This strategy
can also allow bailout techniques in case of branch
coverage.
Recommendation 26: To decrease the risk of atheroembolization, we recommend minimizing intra-aortic
wire, catheter, and endograft manipulation in the aortic
arch and at or above the visceral/renal arteries, especially
in patients with signiﬁcant aortic atheromatous disease
or thrombus. Level of recommendation: Grade 1
(Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 27: We recommend minimizing the
dwelling time of large or occlusive femoral artery sheaths
to decrease the risk of spinal cord ischemia and lower extremity ischemia that can lead to postoperative
compartment syndrome or rhabdomyolysis. In cases in
which a large sheath must be left in place for a prolonged time, it can be withdrawn into the external iliac
artery to allow antegrade ﬂow into the ipsilateral internal
iliac artery. Meticulous postoperative vigilance to detect
inadequate lower extremity perfusion or compartment
syndrome should be routine. Level of recommendation:
