 month intervals.
 Despite this, the duplex itself does not always always reliably detect intervenable lesions
as it does in vein bypasses.

Teaching Case
Scenario
A 73-year-old male with a significant smoking history and medical history including 4 vessel
coronary bypass 10 years ago, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes presents to clinic
for pain in his lower extremities. He states that it is diï¬€cult for him to walk 3 blocks without
having to stop. He locates the pain in his calves bilaterally.. He endorses he has experienced
this pain for over 5 years. He mentions that he previously had a wound that took almost 3
months to heal. He denies presence of new sores or wounds. He had a right lower extremity
angiogram 2 months ago that failed to recanalize the superficial femoral artery (SFA).

Exam
HEENT: No prior neck incisions, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm (RRR), healed stereotomy scar.
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no increased work of breathing.
Abdominal: Soft, non-distended (ND), non-tender (NT)
Vascular/Extremities: Non-palpable lower extremity pulses and what appears to be a
wound that is starting to form on the distal big toe of the right foot. He does have 2+
femoral pulses. On Doppler exam, he has monophasic dorsalis pedis (DP) and posterior tibial
(PT) signals in his right lower extremity.

Imaging
Duplex Ultrasound: On duplex ultrasound, he has a long segment occlusion of the superficial
femoral artery (SFA) and on CTA he has two-vessel run off to the right lower extremity with
well-formed collateralization.
