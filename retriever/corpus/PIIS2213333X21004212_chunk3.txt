reduction in quality of life (QoL) and associated disease
burden and work productivity loss.3-6 In 2014, the annualized US payer disease burden for venous leg ulcers was
estimated to be around US$15 billion, and the overall
treatment cost for varicose veins is projected to reach
US$8 trillion by 2021.2,4,7,8 The disease prevalence is also
expected to increase owing to the obesity pandemic
and an aging population.
Several diagnostic and treatment modalities have been
implemented over many years, including conservative
therapy, open surgical interventions, and endovenous
ablation.9,10 Several studies have compared conservative
vs interventional management options.9-11 However,
the comparative effectiveness of the different interventional treatment options, including open surgical
therapy,
thermal
and
nonthermal
endovenous
ablation, and sclerotherapy among each other, remains
controversial.11-14
In 2011, the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) partnered
with the American Venous Forum (AVF) to develop clinical practice guidelines to improve the care of patients
with chronic venous disease.9 Since the release of the
2011 guideline, additional studies and systematic reviews
have been published.11-14 The SVS and the AVF along with
the American Vein and Lymphatic Society have, therefore, determined there is currently a need to update
the guidelines on the management of chronic venous
disease and the supporting evidence for the guidelines.
The purpose of this analysis is to provide information
pertinent to updating the guidelines speciÔ¨Åcally with
regard to management of varicose veins.

METHODS
This systematic review follows an a priori protocol
developed by a committee from the SVS and AVF
responsible for developing clinical practice guidelines
on the management of varicose veins. This report
