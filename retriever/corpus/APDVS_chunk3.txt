 diseases
including chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) require specialized, multidisciplinary care
for optimal management, but many communities are considered “vascular deserts” in which
there is inadequate access to expert vascular surgery care. (DiLosa et al. 2023) Addressing the

challenges posed by healthcare and vascular deserts, particularly in rural areas, is crucial for
ensuring equitable access to essential services. Continued investigation and investment into
these issues are imperative to develop effective solutions that can bridge the healthcare gaps
and provide optimal care.

Sexual and Gender Minorities:
A growing body of research explores the impact of sex and gender on various aspects of
vascular disease. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 236 studies demonstrates an association between female sex or gender and poorer outcomes in individuals with Abdominal
Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) and Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD). (Lee et al. 2022) It has been
demonstrated that women have higher risk of AAA rupture, prolonged lengths of stay, and
decreased survival following both elective and emergent AAA repair. (Dillavou, Muluk, and
Makaroun 2006) The lack of representation of women in large-scale vascular surgery clinical
trials has also become an area of increasing concern, given the pivotal role these studies play in
shaping the standard of care and management guidelines. Despite efforts to enhance women’s
participation in clinical trials, evidence suggests persistent underrepresentation in randomized control trials, potentially limiting the broader applicability of their findings. (Hoel et al.
2009) The multifactorial nature of this underrepresentation, infuenced by factors like patient
preference, bias, and local demographics, necessitates sustained efforts to achieve diverse recruitment and ensure a more comprehensive understanding of vascular disease across diverse
patient populations.

Veteran Populations:
Military veterans represent a unique population with distinct healthcare needs. While veterans
may benefit from the ability to receive care through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
healthcare system, there remain notable challenges and disparities for this population. Barriers
to medical treatment in the veteran population broadly include long wait times at VA facilities,
mental health illness and stress related to previous deployments, challenges reintegrating into
civilian life, and unmet basic needs such as housing and
