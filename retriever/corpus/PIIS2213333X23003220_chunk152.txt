 7 to 14 days in intermediate-risk patients and
for 4 to 6 weeks in high-risk patients.247 The European
Society for Vascular Surgery recommends VTE risk
assessment in all patients with consideration of individualized thromboprophylaxis (Class IIa, Level B).56
Although the weight of the evidence does suggest
some beneﬁt to pharmacological thromboprophylaxis,
the evidence is difﬁcult to generalize due to the limited
magnitude of effect among those systematic reviews
reporting a beneﬁt of routine thromboprophylaxis (number needed to treat 25.4-172.4 for the prevention of DVT),
lack of risk stratiﬁcation in most studies, and signiﬁcant
heterogeneity in the results. In addition to the uncertain
value of routine thromboprophylaxis, there is little data
regarding optimal agents, dose, or duration of thromboprophylaxis if used. We therefore suggest pharmacoprophylaxis in high-risk patients, but with a low certainty of
evidence.
Evidence. Despite the very low incidence of thromboembolic events among patients undergoing endovenous ablation, one large systematic review did ﬁnd a
signiﬁcantly lower incidence of EHIT among those
receiving pharmacological prophylaxis (1.63% vs 3.04%;
P < .001).234 However, this was not a uniform ﬁnding
across individual studies and there was heterogeneity
in the prophylactic regimes used. Another systematic
review included 8 studies (3 RCTs, 5 cohort studies,
6479 patients) comparing pharmacoprophylaxis to no
prophylaxis following a variety of varicose vein procedures.41 Five studies evaluated prophylaxis after open
surgery and three after EVLA. The risk of DVT was lower
for endovenous procedures than for open surgery.
Prophylaxis was associated with a nonsigniﬁcant
reduction in the composite risk of DVT, PE, and superﬁcial venous thrombosis (pooled RR, 0.63; 95% CI,
0.04-10.43; P ¼ .74) and of D
