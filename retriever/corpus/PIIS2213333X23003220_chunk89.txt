 and meta-analysis by Hassanin et al21
found no signiﬁcant difference in phlebitis rates between
groups (pooled RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.32-1.54). Nonthermal
ablations in this study included mechanochemical ablation and cyanoacrylate vein ablations. A meta-analysis
from Chen et al22 found similar results, with no difference
in phlebitis rates between cyanoacrylate ablations vs RFA
(OR, 51.22; 95% CI, 0.70-2.13; P ¼ .479). Single center
studies published on higher rate of mild phlebitis after
cyanoacrylate ablation, likely also due to a periphlebitic

SVR in 483 limbs
(51.2%)

Treatment of DVO alone
in 168 limbs (17.8%)
Treatment of SVR alone
in 293 limbs (31%)

Ablation of SVR is safe
for patients with DVO.
Patients with advanced
CEAP class ($4) had
better results when
ablation of superﬁcial
truncal veins was
combined with
treatment of iliac vein
obstruction.
Patients with early CEAP
class (<4) had a
staged approach with
initial ablation of SVR
and stenting for DVO
if no improvement
was noted.
