 in rat venous tissue to cause venous dilation by several mechanisms, including hyperpolarization
and inhibition of extracellular calcium mobilization,
which are tightly regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor
(HIF).68-70 In a study evaluating varicose veins in CVD
patients, it was determined that HIF-1a and HIF-2a
transcriptional factors were overexpressed compared
with control nonvaricose veins, suggesting that the HIF
pathway may be associated with several pathophysiologic
changes in the venous wall leading to venous hypertension and that hypoxia may be a feature contributing to
the pathogenesis of varicose veins.70
MMPs have been found to be present in high quantities in VLUs and the associated wound ﬂuid, and there
is a correlation of increased expression of proteinase activity with poor healing. The regulation of MMP production and function, although not fully understood, is likely
to be linked to cytokines, urokinase plasminogen activator, EMMPRIN (extracellular MMP inducer
CD147), platelet-derived growth factor AA, and
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.71-82 Importantly, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in
venous ulcer ﬁbroblast have been demonstrated to overexpress P38, a negative modulator of cell proliferation
causing growth arrest, which can also be upregulated
with the cytokines TNF-a and interleukin-1. The expression of P38 can be suppressed, leading to ﬁbroblast

Cytokines have important roles at different stages of
CVD, beginning with inﬂammation, with expression in
the interstitial space and in the venous ulcer wound
bed.48 In a nonrandomized evaluation of various cytokine levels and venous ulcer healing in patients undergoing compression therapy, it was determined that
untreated ulcers typically display high levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines, including several interleukins, TNF-a,
and interferon-g. After 4 weeks of compression therapy,
the levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines
