 while perforate invaginate (PIN) stripping was
introduced by Oesch168 and perfected in the United States
by Goren and Yellin.169 Varicose vein excision performed
from multiple larger skin incisions170,171 was also abandoned, and ambulatory hook phlebectomy172,173 and
powered phlebectomy174-176 have been adopted.
During the past decade, endovenous thermal ablation
has largely replaced the classic ligation and stripping operation, and open surgery for saphenous incompetence is
performed much less frequently in the United States. Indications for ligation and stripping have been restricted to
patients with large dilated and tortuous saphenous vein
located immediately under the skin or to those with aneurysmal enlargement at the SFJ. Because of previous thrombophlebitis of the GSV or SSV, percutaneous placement of
the laser fiber or radiofrequency (RF) catheter may not be
possible, and open techniques have to be used for removal
of the vein.
It is important to note, however, that the technique of
open surgery has also changed substantially in recent years,
and today a much less invasive procedure is performed to
treat the incompetent saphenous veins than at anytime
before. The groin incision is small, the incision at the knee
for inversion stripping is either a puncture wound (PIN
stripping) or a small stab wound, and the operation is
performed under local tumescent anesthesia with increasing frequency.177 Although endothermal ablations are fa-

vored in the United States, in many countries conventional
surgery remains the standard of care of patients with varicose veins.178
High ligation, division, and stripping of the
GSV. The term high ligation and division implies ligation
and division of the GSV at its confluence with the common
femoral vein, including ligation and division of all upper
GSV tributaries.51 Partial or complete preservation of the
upper GSV tributaries, when the GSV is ligated, stripped,
or ablated, must therefore be clearly stated. The term
stripping means removal of a long vein segment, usually of
the saphenous vein
