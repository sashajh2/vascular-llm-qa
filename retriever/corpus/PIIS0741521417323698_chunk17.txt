Antibiotic prophylaxis. We recommend intravenous
administration of a ﬁrst-generation cephalosporin or, in
the event of penicillin allergy, vancomycin within 30
minutes before OSR or EVAR. Prophylactic antibiotics
should be continued for no more than 24 hours.

If the intraoperative hemoglobin level is <10 g/dL and
blood loss is ongoing, we recommend transfusion of
packed blood cells along with fresh frozen plasma and
platelets in a ratio of 1:1:1.
