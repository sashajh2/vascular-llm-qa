6 concluded that
compression treatment improves the healing of ulcers compared with no compression149 and that high compression is
more effective than low compression.150 The authors
found no evidence that one form of compression treatment
is better than another, although a previously published
single-center experience suggested that low-stretch inelastic bandages were more effective in reducing venous reflux
than elastic bandages.151 The ACCP guidelines suggest the
use of an ICP in addition to a compression garment and
local care for treatment of recalcitrant ulcers.136
A recent meta-analysis by Amsler et al152 examined data
of 692 ulcer patients in eight RCTs and found that ulcer
healing was faster, with an average of 3 weeks, with stockings than with bandages (P ⫽ .0002). Pain, examined in
three studies, was also significantly less with stockings than
with bandages (P ⬍ .0001).
Another systematic review by Partsch et al153 confirmed
(GRADE 1A) that compression bandaging promotes healing
of venous ulcers and that strong-compression hosiery (30 to
40 mm Hg) is more effective than medium- or low-compression stockings (GRADE 1B). This study observed GRADE
1A evidence that 30 to 40 mm Hg compression hosiery
prevents recurrence of ulceration after healing. A recent evidence summary on ulcers by Coleridge-Smith154 supported
these recommendations.
An RCT by Milic et al155 compared treatment with
tubular compression (35 mm Hg) vs compression bandages (25 mm Hg) in 138 patients with extensive venous

ulceration (ulceration surface, 20-210 cm2; duration, 7
months-28 years). The authors observed a healing rate of
93% in the treatment group vs 51% in the control group
(P ⬍ .001). The recurrence rate at 12 months was 24% in
the treatment group and 53% in the control group (P ⬍
.05). After additional compression treatment with the same
treatment protocol, all
