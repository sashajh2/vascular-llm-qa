 with an aneurysm sac
that is shrinking or stable in size, we suggest color duplex
ultrasound for continued surveillance at 6-month intervals for 24 months and then annually thereafter.

In a stable patient presenting with an infected graft, we
suggest in situ reconstruction with femoral vein after
graft excision and débridement.

In unstable patients with infected graft, we recommend
in situ reconstruction with a silver- or antibioticimpregnated graft, cryopreserved allograft, or polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) graft.

If a new endoleak is detected, we suggest evaluation for
a type I or type III endoleak.

We suggest noncontrast-enhanced CT imaging of the

DEFINITION OF THE PROBLEM
Purpose of these guidelines. The Clinical Practice
Council of the Society for Vascular Surgery charged a
writing committee with the task of updating practice
guidelines, initially published in 20031 and subsequently updated in 2009,2 for surgeons and physicians
who are involved in the preoperative, operative, and
postoperative care of patients with AAAs. This document
provides recommendations for evaluating the patient
(including risk of aneurysm rupture and associated
medical comorbidities), guidelines for intervention,
intraoperative strategies, perioperative care, long-term
follow-up, and treatment of late complications.
Decision-making related to the care of patients with AAA
is complex. Aneurysms present with varying risks of
rupture, and patient-speciﬁc factors inﬂuence anticipated life expectancy, operative risk, and need to intervene. Careful attention to the choice of operative
strategy, as inﬂuenced by anatomic features of the AAA,
along with optimal treatment of medical comorbidities
is
