1; 95% CI, 0.69-2.46, P ¼ .41; eight studies; N ¼ 812).
Discussion (ﬁrst paragraph):
Twelve studies were included in this review, with a total of 1136 patients who underwent either a one-stage or
two-stage procedure. In terms of primary outcomes, the pooled evidence from the meta-analyses showed no
differences in primary ﬁstula failure rates, 1-year primary patency rates, 1-year secondary patency rates, 2-year
primary patency rates, and 2-year secondary patency rates.
Discussion (second to last paragraph):
Although there is a slight difference in the range of studies included in both reviews, the evidence from our review
agrees with prior conclusions.

CORRECTION
In the June 2019 regular and supplement issues of the Journal of Vascular Surgery, the editorials by Drs Lawrence
and Gloviczki that published in each issue contained an error in the use of the term “critical limb-threatening
ischemia”. The correct term is “chronic limb-threatening ischemia”. The error has been corrected in the title and
in the ﬁrst paragraph of both of these editorials.

CORRECTION
In the June 2019 supplement of the Journal of Vascular Surgery, the article by Conte et al (Conte MS, Bradbury AW,
Kolh P, White JV, Dick F, Fitridge R, et al. Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limbthreatening ischemia. J Vasc Surg 2019;69:3S-125S) contained a typo in the name of one of the co-authors. Dr Mauro
Gargiulo’s name incorrectly printed as “Mauro Garguilo.” The correct surname is Gargiulo.
