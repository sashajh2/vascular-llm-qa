 timing and frequency of such screening are undeﬁned, and this
concept has not been universally accepted. The evidence
does not appear to be sufﬁcient to recommend routine
screening for asymptomatic patients with previous
neck radiotherapy in the absence of other deﬁned risk
factors.
Patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. Although
patients with PAD and severe CAD are clearly at greatly
increased risk of having occult carotid artery stenosis,
the correlation in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is not as robust. The prevalence of carotid
stenosis of $70% was 8.8% in a population of patients
with AAAs compared with 12.5% in a cohort of PAD patients.115 In a prospective study of patients with AAAs,
the prevalence of asymptomatic carotid stenosis of
$70% was 10.8%.116 No correlation was noted between
the size of the AAA and the degree or presence of carotid

stenosis. In an additional report of 332 patients with AAA
who had undergone carotid duplex ultrasound scans, a
greater prevalence of carotid stenosis was noted, with
30.4% found to have $50% stenosis in one or both carotid arteries.117 However, several additional studies have
revealed the prevalence of carotid stenosis in patients
with AAAs to be <20%.118 Clearly, the correlation of carotid atherosclerosis with isolated abdominal aneurysmal disease is not thought to be as signiﬁcant as the
relationship with coronary and lower extremity atherosclerotic occlusive disease. Therefore, routine screening
for carotid stenosis in asymptomatic patients with AAAs
but without other
