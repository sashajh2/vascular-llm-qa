 safe or effective than PEM.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. PEM, used for treatment of truncal veins and
varicose tributaries is a promising product that appears
to be more stable and cohesive, with a narrow bubble
size distribution compared with physician compounded
foam, used for sclerotherapy of varicose tributaries and
superﬁcial truncal veins.
Evidence. As articulated in the statement, there is no
clinical evidence that sclerotherapy with PCF, prepared
using the Tessari method is less safe or effective than
PEM. There are no prospective studies comparing the
two techniques since the VANISH-2 RCT compared
0.5% and 1% PEM with placebo (Table XIX).206 In laboratory testing, PEM had a narrow bubble size distribution,

better stability, more cohesive properties and lower
degradation rate than any PCFs.213 Prospective randomized studies comparing PEM with PCF in patients with
varicose veins are warranted.
8. Treatment of varicose tributaries concomitant or
staged with superﬁcial truncal ablation
8.1.1. For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the GSV
or SSV and associated varicosities, we recommend
ablation of the reﬂuxing venous trunk and concomitant phlebectomy or UGFS of the varicosities with
PCF or PEM.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
8.1.2. For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the
AAGSV or PAGSV, we suggest ablation of the reﬂuxing
venous trunk and concomitant phlebectomy or UGFS
of the varicosities with PCF or PEM.
GUIDELINE: Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (low to very low)
