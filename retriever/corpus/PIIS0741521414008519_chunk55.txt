pain, cellulitis, purulence, increased exudate, malodor, discolored friable granulation tissue, bioﬁlm, tissue necrosis,
or ulcer progression, microbiologic cultures are recommended. Microbiology cultures can be obtained from
wound surface or wound drainage by validated quantitative bacteriology swab methods with reproducible reliability compared with deep wound tissue biopsy and
culture. Molecular techniques using polymerase chain reaction analysis may improve pathogen identiﬁcation over
standard swab culture methods.119,120 Deep wound tissue
cultures should be reserved for wounds colonized with
multiple micro-organisms when the bacterial pathogen is
not clear from surface cultures, for bioﬁlm infections, or
for recurrent or persistent infection despite appropriate
antimicrobial therapy.121-125

Guideline 3.5: Wound Biopsy
We recommend wound biopsy for leg ulcers that do
not improve with standard wound and compression
therapy after 4 to 6 weeks of treatment and for all ulcers with atypical features. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE - C]
When VLUs do not respond to standard wound and
compression therapy, contributing factors should be considered, including infection and possible misdiagnosis. Whereas
evidence does not support an absolute time frame, most evidence and clinical practice guidelines suggest tissue biopsy
considerations within 4 to 6 weeks of nonresponsiveness
to standard treatment. The biopsy specimen should be obtained from several sites, including the wound edge and central provisional matrix. Another consideration for tissue
biopsy independent of time frame is differentiation of other
possible nonvenous causes for leg ulcer. Although malignancy is rare, for any VLU with atypical features, wound tissue biopsy should also be performed.126-128 Although
wound tissue biopsy provides valuable histologic differentiation, additional tissue analysis to include inﬂammatory cytokines and MMPs is still under investigation and does not
have current clinical applicability.83,
