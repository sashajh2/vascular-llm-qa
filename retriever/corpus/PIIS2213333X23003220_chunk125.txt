Bradbury et al studied 1252 legs with C2 to C6 disease.218 They were treated with UGFS. There were 868
C2 and C3 patients. The authors found that out of 1031
patients initially treated for GSV reﬂux, only 11.8%
required a second UGFS for recurrent reﬂux. Of the 139
patients with AAGSV reﬂux, 10.1% required a second
UGFS for recurrent reﬂux. Of the 239 patients with SSV
