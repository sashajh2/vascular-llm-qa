cant differences in three important metabolic products; creatine,
lactate, and myoinositol metabolites are increased and
amounts of lipid metabolites are lower compared with
nonvaricose control veins.89 Analysis of the cellular
metabolism in varicose veins, with signature end products, reﬂects the metabolism of the tissue and provides
key information to the disease processes. Further
research in this exciting ﬁeld is necessary to have a better understanding of the processes leading to CVD and
to determine whether patients with venous ulcers have
certain characteristic metabolic proﬁles that will allow
improved targeted therapy in both the prevention and
active treatment of CVD and VLUs. Another potential
mechanism for the development of CVD and VLUs is
hypoxia in the dermis and apoptosis of the vein wall;
however, studies evaluating these pathophysiologic alterations are more likely to be simple associations,
with signiﬁcant variability in results and therefore
inconclusive.90,91

CLINICAL EVALUATION

Guideline 3.1: Clinical Evaluation
We recommend that for all patients with suspected
leg ulcers ﬁtting the deﬁnition of venous leg ulcer, clinical evaluation for evidence of chronic venous disease be
performed. [BEST PRACTICE]

For a leg ulcer to be classiﬁed as a VLU, there needs to
be clinical manifestations consistent with CVD. Clinical
evaluation should differentiate primary, secondary, or
congenital venous problems and establish presence or
absence of venous reﬂux, obstruction, or both. A thorough
medical history should be performed to identify symptoms
potentially related to venous disease, including extremity
pain, burning aching, throbbing, cramps, heaviness, itching, tiredness, fatigue, and restless legs. Venous symptoms
are usually exacerbated by limb dependency and relieved by
rest or elevation. Medical history should also include risk
factor assessment for venous disease, including age, body
mass index, prior venous thromboembolism, family history
of venous thromboembolism, family history of varicose
veins, episodes of superﬁcial thrombophlebitis, spontaneous venous rupture, prior use of compression
