 the operative approach. When a pulsatile
mass is discovered in a patient after prior OSR of an AAA,
the presence of an anastomotic pseudoaneurysm,68 iliac
artery aneurysm,69 or suprarenal aortic aneurysm70
should be considered. Abdominal or back pain after
EVAR should also prompt evaluation of potential aneurysm expansion or rupture.71-73

Physical examination
An AAA is generally deﬁned as an enlargement of the
abdominal aorta to $3.0 cm in diameter. The abdominal
aorta begins at the diaphragm, typically at the twelfth
thoracic vertebra, and lies in the retroperitoneum just
anterior to and slightly left of the vertebral column.
With increasing age, the aorta elongates and enlarges,
so the location of a pulsatile mass on physical examination can be variable. At the level of the umbilicus and
fourth lumbar vertebra, the aorta bifurcates into the right
and left common iliac arteries. The focused examination
for an aortic aneurysm should be directed at the upper
abdominal quadrants.
Physical examination has only a moderate sensitivity for
detecting AAA, depending on the extent of abdominal
girth and aneurysm size.74 The common iliac arteries
may also become aneurysmal and palpable in the lower
abdominal quadrants. A number of theories have been
proposed to explain the predilection of aneurysmal
degeneration to the abdominal aorta and common iliac
arteries, but none are deﬁnitive.75 Palpation does not
precipitate rupture, and the concern for a symptomatic
aneurysm should not preclude thorough examination.
An abdominal aneurysm is common (37%-40%) in
patients with popliteal artery aneurysms,76-78 as are
concurrent distal arterial aneurysms in patients with an
AAA.79-81

In patients with a suspected or known AAA, we recommend
performing physical examination that includes an
assessment
