 statistical difference in the
postoperative success or complications between the two
groups.138 QOL measures did not signiﬁcantly differ between groups, except for the >65-year-old group, which
demonstrated better QOL in ofﬁce-based setting
compared with the day surgery group.138 Another prospective study sent questionnaires to patients who underwent endovenous ablation with concomitant
phlebectomy in the ofﬁce-based setting and found a
high (98.1%) satisfaction level, with 94.7% of the patients
stating they would undergo the same procedure again in
the same setting, if needed.139 In summary, varicose vein
procedures in the ofﬁce-based setting have a low
complication rate, high patient satisfaction and they are
cost effective.
It is important to note, however, that appropriate treatment of patients with venous disease is dependent not
just on evidence-based guidelines, but that physicians
and qualiﬁed health care professionals have the requisite
education, training and skills to provide such care. In the
context of interventional venous procedures, multispecialty agreement has been reached on the required
training and experience needed for physicians to
perform speciﬁc venous treatments.140 In addition, the
role and degree of involvement by licensed advanced
practice providers, physician assistants and nurse practitioners, has also been deﬁned by the Intersocietal
Accreditation Commission, along with that of nursing
staff and ultrasound technologists. Because these venous
interventions are mostly performed in the private ofﬁce
or ofﬁce-based laboratory setting, the supervising physician has the responsibility to ensure that any procedure,
or parts of procedures, not personally performed by
them is done by an appropriately qualiﬁed and licensed
individual under sufﬁcient level of supervision.
5.2.3. In patients with symptomatic C2 disease, isolated SFJ incompetence does not justify ablation of
an otherwise competent GSV.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. The impact of junctional reﬂux on clinical
manifestations and treatment outcomes is not clear.
Reﬂux patterns and the presence or absence of SFJ
reﬂux have been evaluated in multiple studies and a signiﬁcant percentage of symptomatic patients have been
shown to have lower extremity
