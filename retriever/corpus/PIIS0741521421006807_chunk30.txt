ALI (Rutherford grade IIb) should undergo prompt surgical or endovascular PAA repair, with the use of
adjunctive surgical thromboembolectomy or pharmacomechanical intervention to maximize tibiopedal
outﬂow. Nonviable limbs (Rutherford grade III) require
amputation (grade 1B).
When patients present with an acutely thrombosed
PAA, the degree of ischemic insult will determine the
course of management.23,37,43 ALI resulting from PAA
thrombosis is frequently associated with a complete
lack of patent tibiopedal runoff arteries. The indication
for preoperative intra-arterial thrombolysis is restricted to
selected patients who can withstand an additional period
of limb ischemia (Rutherford grade I and IIa).40,42 In this
condition, the rationale for thrombolysis is primarily to
restore runoff for bypass grafting or endovascular repair.
If arteriography demonstrates thrombosis of the PAA
alone, with a good inﬂow source and suitable outﬂow,
lytic therapy is not indicated, and prompt surgical or
endovascular reconstruction should be performed.37 If
the clot extends into the tibial arteries, without a visible
runoff vessel, thrombolysis can be very useful to restore
patency in at least one tibial vessel if the patient tolerates
this intervention and ischemia is not worsened.40-42,44 Patients with limb threatening ischemia (Rutherford grade
IIb) cannot tolerate the additional ischemic time required
by infusion thrombolysis and should urgently undergo
surgical or endovascular revascularization,23,40 with the
use of adjuncts, including mechanical or aspiration
thrombectomy, to clear runoff vessels. For these patients,
combined mechanical and thrombolytic therapy (pharmacomechanical thrombolysis) may increase the lytic effect, reducing the procedural time. Depending on the
severity and duration of ischemia and the physical examination ﬁndings, calf fasciotomies may be required after
successful revascularization.
Failure to establish a bypass target vessel using either
lytic or operative methods can necessitate amputation,
depending on the patient’s clinical condition.40,42 Limbs
