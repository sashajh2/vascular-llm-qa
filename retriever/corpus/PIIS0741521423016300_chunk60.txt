Recommendation 22
A person with diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and either a
foot ulcer or gangrene should be treated by a multidisciplinary team as part of a comprehensive care plan.

clinical examination is often too unreliable. Diabetes
related PAD is characterised by atherosclerotic plaque
formation that is long and diffuse in nature and more
likely to involve distal vascular beds. Frequently, long
term patency is not achieved in endovascular treatment
of tibial lesions.127
Regular assessment of perfusion post-revascularisation
should therefore be undertaken due to the risk of occlusion and restenosis after intervention. This should be conducted in combination with regular assessment of the
foot lesion to determine whether healing is indeed taking place. It is recommended that revascularisation
should aim to improve perfusion to the foot as much
as possible, which will vary according to the individual.
Due to the lack of data available determining the optimum time frame for follow up and the likelihood that
this may vary depending on the testing methods being
used, a Best Practice Statement based on indirect evidence and expert opinion has been made.
Rationale
As discussed in several parts of this guideline and in
other IWGDF guidelines on the diagnosis and management of DFU, restoration of perfusion in the foot is only
part of the treatment, which should be provided by a
multidisciplinary care team.43 Lack of access to specialist
care is associated with worse foot outcomes. In rural and
remote locations and areas where specialist access is
challenging, referral pathways that address care access
(e.g., through virtual referral pathways) are essential to
establish to provide multidisciplinary care.128 Any revascularisation procedure should therefore be part of a
comprehensive care plan that addresses other important
issues including: prompt treatment of concurrent infection, regular wound debridement, biomechanical offloading, control of blood glucose, cardiovascular risk
reduction, and treatment of co-morbidities.128 Moreover,
once the ulcer has healed the risk of recurrence is up to
50% over ï¿½
