competent superﬁcial veins that have reﬂux to the ulcer bed in addition to pathologic perforating veins
(outward ﬂow of >500 ms duration, with a diameter
of >3.5 mm) located beneath or associated with the ulcer bed, we suggest ablation of both the incompetent
superﬁcial veins and perforator veins in addition to
standard compressive therapy to aid in ulcer healing
and to prevent recurrence. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE - C]
The evidence regarding treatment of perforator venous
reﬂux associated with a VLU is complicated by several factors but most notably by combining its treatment with that
of superﬁcial venous reﬂux.339-352 The Dutch RCT
comparing subfascial endoscopic perforator vein surgery
(SEPS) with or without superﬁcial reﬂux ablation to medical treatment in patients with venous ulcers found no difference in healing rate or recurrence in the two treatment
groups.317 However, patients with recurrent ulceration or
medially located ulcers in the surgical group had a longer
ulcer-free period than did those treated in the conservative
group (P ¼ .02). A secondary analysis of the Dutch SEPS
trial on 94 ulcerated legs was reported with a mean followup of 29 months.353 Ulcer recurrence was signiﬁcantly
higher in patients who had an incomplete SEPS procedure
(P ¼ .007), indicating the clinical signiﬁcance of incompetent perforating veins in patients with venous ulcers.

A meta-analysis that included this RCT and 19 case series
involving 1140 treated limbs found that surgical treatment
by SEPS, with or without superﬁcial venous ablation, resulted
in ulcer healing in 88% and a low ulcer recurrence of 13% at
21 months.340 Another meta-analysis concluded that perforator interruption used as a part of a treatment regimen for
severe CVI beneﬁts most patients in the short term regarding
ulcer healing and the prevention of ulcer.345
