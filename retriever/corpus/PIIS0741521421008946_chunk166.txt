otid stenosis, respectively.526 If carotid occlusion is present, risk of
perioperative stroke increases to 7% to 12%.527-530 It is unknown whether carotid stenosis itself speciﬁcally increases stroke risk in patients undergoing CABG or
whether carotid stenosis is a marker of diffuse atherosclerotic disease. Even the presence of a bruit increases
the risk of stroke to 1.6% to 5.5%.524,531,532
If possible, patients with coronary disease amenable to
percutaneous coronary intervention should be treated in
that manner, followed by treatment of the carotid stenosis. Options for management of both carotid and coronary disease include staged CEA followed by CABG,
CABG followed by CEA, simultaneous CABG and CEA,
staged CAS followed by CABG, or even CAS with CABG
or coronary percutaneous intervention the same
day.533,534 A review of the current literature suggests
that the lowest stroke risk occurs when CEA is performed
ﬁrst, followed by staged CABG. Understandably, combined CEA and CABG has the highest mortality risk,
whereas CABG ﬁrst followed by CEA has the lowest mortality risk, but the highest stroke risk, as suggested by
older studies.535,536 However, these studies were not prospectively randomized because of the complex decisionmaking involved in caring for these patients. A
meta-analysis, however, by Naylor et al527 reported the
total stroke/MI/death risk with any combination CEA
and CABG ranges from 9% to 12%. In addition, Klarin
et al537 reviewed the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult
Cardiac database, assessing 22,355 patients with CABG
between 2011 and 2016. Results showed that concomitant CEA did not reduce stroke risk regardless of the patient having an off-pump or on-pump CABG, although a
directly comparison to a staged approach was not
possible.537 An additional meta-analysis of 21,710 synchronous CABG-CEA patients and 23,1
