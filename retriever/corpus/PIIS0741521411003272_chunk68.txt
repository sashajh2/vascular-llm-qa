 and ligation using nonabsorbable
suture, with exposed endothelium of the stump) or a flush
saphenofemoral ligation (the stump was oversewn with a
running polypropylene suture, with no endothelium exposed) was used. At 2 years, the recurrence rate was 33% in
the standard group and 32% in the flush group (P ⫽ .90).
Neovascularization was present in 22% in standard group
and in 19% in the flush group (P ⫽ .57).

Another RCT on 389 limbs by van Rij et al199 observed
that placement of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patch
over the SFJ halved recurrence at 3 years compared with
controls and that a synthetic patch was an effective mechanical suppressant of neovasculogenesis at the groin. These
findings were not confirmed, however, in a smaller RCT by
Winterborn and Earnshaw.200 This study randomized 40
legs to insertion or no insertion of a PTFE patch over the
ligated SFJ. The overall complication rate was 35% (11
legs), with no statistically significant difference between the
groups. By 2 years postoperatively, duplex imaging showed
neovascularization had developed at the SFJ in 4 of 16 legs
without a patch and in 5 of 16 legs with a patch (P ⫽ 1.0).
We recommend double ligation of the SFJ with nonabsorbable suture (GRADE 1C), but we suggest against using a
PTFE patch to cover the saphenous stump (GRADE 2C).
Complications. Wound complications usually occur in
3% to 10% of patients,178,201 with reported wound infection rates as low as 1.5% and as high as 16%.202-204 An RCT
by Biswas et al205 evaluated the efficacy of the duration of
compression therapy in 300 postsurgical patients. The
study found no benefit in wearing compression stockings
for ⬎1 week after uncomplicated HL/S
