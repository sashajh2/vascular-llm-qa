We recommend preprocedure and postprocedure hydration with normal saline or 5% dextrose/sodium bicarbonate for patients at increased risk of contrast-induced
nephropathy (CIN) undergoing EVAR.

We recommend holding metformin at the time of
administration of contrast material among patients
with an estimated glomerular Ô¨Åltration rate (eGFR)
of <60 mL/min or up to 48 hours before administration
of contrast material if the eGFR is <45 mL/min.

We recommend restarting metformin no sooner than
48 hours after administration of contrast material as
long as renal function has remained stable (<25%
increase in creatinine concentration above baseline).

Aneurysm imaging. We recommend using ultrasound,
when feasible, as the preferred imaging modality for
aneurysm screening and surveillance.
