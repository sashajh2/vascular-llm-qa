We recommend that all patients be treated with knee-high compression
stockings (30 to 40 mm Hg) for at least 2 years after the procedure.

A first episode of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is
estimated to occur with a weighted mean age-adjusted
incidence of 50.4/100,000 person-years.1 Historically, the
treatment of acute DVT has been directed toward the
prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE)

and has been defined by randomized clinical trials. These
trials have usually focused on the short-term outcomes after
anticoagulant therapy, using recurrent VTE and bleeding
as primary measures of efficacy and safety.2-4 Such trials

effective, with major hemorrhage in 2% of patients5 and
3-month recurrence rates as low as 5.5%.6 However, the
importance of late manifestations of the postthrombotic
syndrome have been increasingly recognized, and it is clear
that conventional anticoagulation alone provides imperfect
protection against the postthrombotic syndrome. Among
355 patients with a first episode of DVT, the cumulative
incidence of any and severe postthrombotic syndrome at 5
years was 28% and 9.3%, respectively.7 Predictors of more
severe postthrombotic syndrome include involvement of
the common femoral or iliac veins, previous ipsilateral
thrombosis, higher body mass index, older age, and female
sex.8 Although the socioeconomic consequences of severe
postthrombotic syndrome are well recognized, even mild
postthrombotic symptoms may adversely affect quality of
