FA. Fernandez et al treated 183 patients with a
GSV diameter <12 mm and 74 with a GSV diameter
$12 mm. There was signiﬁcant improvement in pain
and QOL in both groups, with no difference in occlusion rates or adverse effects at 1, 6, and 12 months.161
Borsuk and Fokin conducted a prospective study of
261 EVLA procedures of the GSV with a 1470-nm radial
tip laser. Mean diameter of GSV at the SFJ was
24 6 6 mm (range, 21-43 mm).162 88% of veins were
occluded on day 1; of the 31 nonoccluded veins, 21 of
the 31 were occluded by day 7. Ochoa Chaar et al163
reviewed 732 laser ablations, 88 were performed on
veins measuring >10 mm in diameter. Complication
and closure rates were similar for larger and smaller
veins, unsuccessful closure was more likely in the SSV
and anterior accessory saphenous vein (AASV) than in
the GSV.163 In a small case series, Florescu et al164 performed 20 ablations of veins >10 mm and 4 ablations
on veins $20 mm in diameter; successful ablation was
achieved in 100%. In a retrospective study, 129 patients
with a GSV $14 mm underwent either stripping or
RFA.165 A composite endpoint of pain, subcutaneous
hemorrhage, and paresthesia; the technical outcome at
1 year was evaluated. There were favorable outcomes in
