 The
physician should also establish the degree of disability
caused by the venous disease and its impact on the patient’s
QOL.

Duplex scanning
Duplex scanning is recommended as the first diagnostic
test for all patients with suspected CVD.5,79 The test is safe,
noninvasive, cost-effective, and reliable. It has much better
diagnostic accuracy in the assessment of venous insufficiency than continuous-wave Doppler ultrasonography.80
B-mode imaging permits accurate placement of the pulsed
Doppler sample volume, and the addition of color makes it
easier to establish obstruction, turbulence, and the direction of venous and arterial flow.44 Duplex scanning is
excellent for the evaluation of infrainguinal venous obstruction and valvular incompetence.81 It also differentiates
between acute venous thrombosis and chronic venous
changes.82,83
Technique of the examination. The technique of
venous duplex scanning has been described in detail previously by several authors.80
