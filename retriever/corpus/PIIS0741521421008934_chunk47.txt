 issues is the role of prophylactic CEA and/or CAS in CABG patients with unilateral 70% to 99% asymptomatic stenosis, for whom the
stroke risk might be <2%.135,136 Two RCTs and several
observational series compared combined CEA and
CABG with a strategy of CABG ﬁrst and delayed CEA in
patients with unilateral asymptomatic carotid stenosis.137,138 In the series by Illuminati et al,137 the risk of
stroke with CABG ﬁrst was greater than that in the combined series; however, in the series by Weimar et al,138 the
contrary was true. Owing to small numbers in both series,
these differences were not signiﬁcant; therefore, one
must assess larger series to obtain meaningful
interpretations.
For patients undergoing CAS, a trend was found for
decreased mortality with CAS ﬁrst; however, the
number of patients assessed was small.14 If the option of carotid intervention is considered as either
CEA or CAS, when comparing combined carotid
intervention vs carotid intervention ﬁrst for asymptomatic patients, the endpoints of stroke and
stroke/death are slightly favored in the carotid intervention group.14 Because these data are based primarily on observational data, the certainty of the
conclusions remains low.
Patients’ values and preferences
Patients undergoing CABG already have an increased
risk of stroke and, therefore, many would prefer combined treatment to potentially decrease their risk with
one procedure. However, if patients are severely symptomatic from either coronary disease or carotid disease,
they might be more likely to wish for symptomatic relief

rather than overall risk reduction. If anatomically suitable,
CAS seems favorable for symptomatic patients. In addition, patients with CAD amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention should undergo such intervention,
followed by treatment of the carotid stenosis. In addition,
patients should be considered for CEA with regional
anesthesia before CABG, if possible.139-141
Recommendation 5.1. For patients with symptomatic
carotid stenosis of 50% to 99%, who require both CEA
and CABG, we suggest CEA before,
