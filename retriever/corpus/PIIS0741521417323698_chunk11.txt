should be based on an outer wall to outer wall measurement perpendicular to the path of the aorta.
Level of recommendation

Good Practice Statement

Quality of evidence

Ungraded

We recommend a one-time ultrasound screening for
AAAs in men or women 65 to 75 years of age with a history of tobacco use.
Level of recommendation

1 (Strong)

Quality of evidence

A (High)

We suggest ultrasound screening for AAA in ﬁrstdegree relatives of patients who present with an AAA.
Screening should be performed in ﬁrst-degree relatives
who are between 65 and 75 years of age or in those older
than 75 years and in good health.
Level of recommendation
Quality of evidence

C (Low)

We suggest a one-time ultrasound screening for AAAs
in men or women older than 75 years with a history of tobacco use and in otherwise good health who have not
previously received a screening ultrasound examination.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

If initial ultrasound screening identiﬁed an aortic diameter
>2.5 cm but <3 cm, we suggest rescreening after 10 years.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

We suggest surveillance imaging at 3-year intervals for
patients with an AAA between 3.0 and 3.9 cm.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

We recommend a CT scan to evaluate patients thought
to have AAA presenting with recent-onset abdominal or
back pain, particularly in the presence of a pulsatile
epigastric mass or signiﬁcant risk factors for AAA.
Level of recommendation

The decision to treat. We suggest referral to a vascular
surgeon at the time of initial diagnosis of an aortic aneurysm.
Level of recommendation

Good Practice Statement

Quality of evidence

Ungraded

We recommend repair for the patient who presents
with an AAA and abdominal or back pain that is likely
to be attributed to the aneurysm.
Level of recommendation

We recommend elective repair for the patient
