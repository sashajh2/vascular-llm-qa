Assessment of operative risk and life expectancy
Several prediction models developed to estimate operative risk for open AAA repair and EVAR hold the promise
of better informing patients of their individual risk of
perioperative mortality and provide surgeons a useful
tool to ensure an informed discussion with patients
and their families. Risk prediction models for aneurysm
repair were ﬁrst developed in the 1990s, largely derived
from relatively small cohorts of several hundred patients
treated by OSR.303 The most well known of this ﬁrst generation of risk model were the Glasgow Aneurysm Score
(GAS), the Leiden Score, and the Hardman Index. As one
example, the GAS was developed from a cohort of 268
open AAA repairs, of which 41% of patients presented
with ruptured aneurysms and the overall mortality was
20%. The risk score accounted for age, presence of shock,
renal disease, and history of myocardial or cerebrovascular disease.304 The European Collaborators on Stent/graft
Techniques for aortic Aneurysm Repair (EUROSTAR) suggested that the GAS could be used to estimate mortality
for EVAR with 30-day mortality of 1.1% for GAS <74, 2.1%
for GAS of 74 to 84, and 5.3% for GAS >84.305
During the past 7 years, a variety of new risk scoring
schemes have been derived from an assessment of patients who have undergone either open repair or EVAR
to speciﬁcally account for the mortality risk associated

with EVAR. Egorova and coworkers used Medicare data
to identify EVAR patients with increased operative risk
due to the presence of many of the same risk factors
for mortality that had been previously identiﬁed among
patients undergoing open repair, including age, renal
failure, congestive heart failure, peripheral artery disease,
and liver disease.306 They found that only 3.4% of Medicare patients undergoing EVAR had an operative risk
>5%, but a subset, which represented <1% of patients
undergoing EVAR, was identiﬁed with a predicted mortality of >10%.
