 recommendations are GRADE 2 with Level 3 data, the task force felt it
appropriate to present these as the unanimous opinion of its
members regarding optimal current management. This was
done with the recognition that such recommendations
could change in the future but that it was unlikely that new
data would emerge soon. These guidelines are likely to be a
“living document” that will change as techniques are further refined, technology develops, medical therapy improves, and new data emerge.
I. INDICATIONS FOR CAROTID
BIFURCATION IMAGING
Stroke is the third leading cause of death, behind
coronary artery disease (CAD) and cancer, and is the leading cause of disability in the United States and Western Europe. Approximately 80% of strokes are ischemic
and 20% are hemorrhagic.15 Significant carotid stenosis
(⬎50%) is seen in 12% to 20% of all anterior circulation
ischemic strokes, which is two to three times higher than
the risk for less severe asymptomatic stenosis.16,17 Unfortunately, only 15% of stroke victims have a warning TIA
before stroke, and waiting until symptoms occur is not
ideal.18 The purpose of carotid bifurcation imaging is to
detect “stroke-prone” carotid bifurcation plaque and identify a high-risk patient likely to benefit from therapy designed to reduce stroke risk.
Stroke risk is dependent on many factors, but for patients with carotid bifurcation disease, the most important
are a history of neurologic symptoms, the degree of stenosis
of the carotid bifurcation plaque, and to a lesser extent,
plaque characteristics such as ulcerations, intraplaque hemorrhage, and lipid content.
The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and European Carotid Surgery
Trial (ECST) clearly demonstrated the efficacy of CEA in
reducing stroke in patients with symptoms of carotid territory cerebral ischemia and carotid bifurcation stenosis that
reduced luminal diameter by ⬎50%.2-4 In these studies, the
risk of stroke was higher in patients with a clear history of
