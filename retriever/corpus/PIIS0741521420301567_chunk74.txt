evidence

1.1

In patients who are thought to have jejunal artery, ileal artery, and colic artery
aneurysms, we recommend CTA as the diagnostic tool of choice.

B (Moderate)

1.2

In patients with high radiation exposure risks or renal insufﬁciency, we
recommend non-contrast-enhanced MRA for diagnosis.

1 (Strong)

C (Moderate)

Technical remark: Non-contrast-enhanced MRA is best suited to children and
women of childbearing potential or those who have contraindications to CTA
or MRA contrast materials (ie, pregnancy, renal insufﬁciency, or gadolinium
contrast material allergy).
1.3

We recommend the use of catheter-based angiography for all emergent cases
presenting with rupture (Grade 1B) and electively for preoperative planning
(Grade 1C).

1.4

We suggest screening all patients with jejunal, ileal, and colic artery aneurysms
for vasculitis with routine inﬂammatory markers.
