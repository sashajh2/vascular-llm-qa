 physical activity level.485-487 A recent literature review that studied the importance of lifestyle changes and self-care
activities in preventing recurrence of VLUs identiﬁed 16
studies. This review concluded that there is some evidence
to support a beneﬁcial impact of increased physical activity,
improved mobility, and foot exercises on lowering recurrence.488 A Dutch RCT investigated the effectiveness of
the Lively Leg self-management program and showed a
decrease in the duration of VLUs and increased use of
leg exercises in patients who received the additional lifestyle
counseling.461 The time to recurrence and compliance to
compression, however, were not affected. Other online
coaching and home-based exercises programs were successfully developed.489-491 Two prospective studies focused on
the impact of supervised exercise. An RCT in patients with
skin changes or ulceration demonstrated a signiﬁcant
improvement of calf pump function after a 6-month program of structured exercise.492 Another study concluded
that even a short 7-day period of supervised isotonic calf
muscle exercises in patients with VLUs improves global hemodynamics in limbs with ulceration.493 A program of
venous rehabilitation that includes four phases of training
(warming, exercises on a speciﬁc bike, walking, and relaxation) showed some beneﬁt in a recent study.494 Because
mobilization of the foot and ankle joint increases venous
reﬁlling and reduces venous pressure, passive manipulation
of the ankle has been also proposed, but there is no evidence of the beneﬁcial effect for VLUs. Orthopedic treatment might be indicated for foot anomalies, but there is
no evidence supporting improvement of venous plantar
pump function.
Guideline 7.4: Manual Lymphatic Drainage
We suggest against adjunctive lymphatic drainage for
healing of the chronic venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2;

Massage of the leg to improve lymphatic drainage is
well established as an effective therapy in patients with lymphedema. Manual lymphatic drainage increases the transport capacity of the lymphatics, stimulates development
of lymphatic collaterals, and softens ﬁbrotic tissue. This is
