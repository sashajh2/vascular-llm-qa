 categorized by the type of guideline
development required. All guidelines were developed by
building on existing guidelines with a complementary literature search by the section sub-committee.
In this process of guideline development for VLUs, the
Venous Ulcer Guidelines Committee also reviewed prior

published consensus documents and the AVF report from
the 2006 Venous Summit and the 2009 Paciﬁc Vascular
Symposium, whose purpose was to reduce the incidence
of venous ulcer during the next decade by 50%.29 In a previous systematic review of recently published venous ulcer
guidelines, 14 venous ulcer guidelines were identiﬁed
worldwide.18 This review showed that there was a high degree of agreement among the 14 VLU guidelines on recommendations for compression (72%), dressings (72%),
pentoxifylline (73%), prevention of recurrence by belowknee stockings (70%), and surgery (82%). There was a
low proportion of agreement in the areas of diagnosis, clinical evaluation, and venous Doppler and duplex ultrasound;
in elements of wound care: measurement of the wound,
washing of the wound, débridement, and speciﬁc type of
wound dressing; and ﬁnally in adjunctive measures: the
use of skin grafts and physical therapy to promote ankle
mobility with enhancement of the calf muscle pump.
Several areas of “controversy” were identiﬁed that had
not been particularly addressed in previous guidelines:
new innovative, less invasive VLU therapies; the role of iliac
obstruction and occlusion with the need for diagnosis by
intravascular ultrasound and subsequent monitoring of
stenting by this technique; when and by what methods
to treat perforators; the need for physical therapy to promote ankle mobility and function of the calf muscle
pump; the role of advanced dressings; and preventing progression to VLU. These areas received special attention in
review for the current guidelines.
The surgery/endovascular and compression sections
were selected for a de novo development of speciﬁc guideline recommendations based on several of these key questions. For additional systematic review involving these
critical areas, the Venous Ulcer Guidelines Committee
commissioned an independent group of researchers to
conduct two systematic reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of
