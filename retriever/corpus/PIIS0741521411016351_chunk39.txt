acute stroke is not recommended; however, treatment of
hypertension after this period has passed is associated
with reduced risk of subsequent stroke. The target parameters are not well defined (GRADE 1, Level of
Evidence C).
3. Treatment of diabetes with the goal of tight glucose
control has not been shown to reduce stroke risk or
decrease complication rates after CEA and is not recommended for these purposes (GRADE 2, Level of Evidence A).
4. Anticoagulation is not recommended for the treatment
of TIA or acute stroke, unless there is evidence of a
cardioembolic source (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B).
5. Antiplatelet therapy in asymptomatic patients with carotid atherosclerosis is recommended to reduce overall
cardiovascular morbidity, although it has not been
shown to be effective in the primary prevention of stroke
(GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A).
6. Antiplatelet therapy is recommended for secondary
stroke prevention: aspirin, aspirin combined with dipyridamole, and clopidogrel are all effective. Clopidogrel
combined with aspirin is not more effective than either
drug alone (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B).
7. Perioperative medical management of patients undergoing carotid revascularization should include blood
pressure control (⬍140/80 mm Hg), ␤-blockade
(heart rate, 60-80 beats/min), and statin therapy (LDL
⬍100 mg/dL) (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence B).
8. Perioperative antithrombotic therapy for CEA should
include aspirin (81-325 mg) (GRADE 1, Level of Evidence A). The use of clopidogrel in the perioperative
period should be decided case-by-case (GRADE 2 Level
of Evidence B).
9. Perioperative antithrombotic management of CAS patients should include dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticlopidine or clopidogrel. Dual-antiplatelet
therapy should be initiated at least 3 days before CAS
and continued for 1 month, and aspirin therapy
should be continued indefinitely (GRADE 1, Level of
Evidence C).
