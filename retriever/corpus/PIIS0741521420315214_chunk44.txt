Arterial lines, large-bore venous access, and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) drains are placed before TEVAR. The necessity for each of these depends on the complexity of
the repair, the risk of spinal cord ischemia, the planned
duration of the procedure, and the likelihood of signiﬁcant blood loss. Other adjunctive techniques performed
during TEVAR, such as somatosensory and motor evoked
potential monitoring, rapid arterial pacing, or pharmacologically induced hypotension, may be used as well.
Practice Statement: Comparative, high-quality data
regarding the use of local anesthesia vs general anesthesia during the performance of TEVAR are lacking,
and it is typically physician or hospital dependent. (Ungraded good practice statement)
Spinal cord protection. Spinal cord injury (SCI) can be
a devastating complication that has a profound impact
on the beneﬁt of the procedure, given the higher risk of
mortality if it occurs. Although up to 70% of patients
will have some functional improvement after suffering
SCI, only 38% are reported to return to normal function.108 Those patients who do not have functional
improvement have an abysmal prognosis, with mortality
as high as 75% at 1 year.108,109
Given these poor results after SCI, a number of prevention strategies have been employed to mitigate risk,
including maintenance of LSA and hypogastric
patency,110 staging strategies for long-segment aortic
coverage,111 prophylactic CSF drainage, anemia prevention, permissive hypertension, steroid and naloxone therapy,112 burst suppression, permissive hypothermia, and
hyperoxygenation therapy. Most successful centers
employ a multimodal and systematic approach to SCI
prevention, with detailed protocols on management of
spinal drains, multidisciplinary coordination, and rescue
procedures for those presenting with delayed SCI.113
Techniques for spinal cord protection after thoracic
aortic surgery have evolved signiﬁcantly during the last
four decades.96 Paraplegia after TEVAR limited to the
DTA is uncommon (<5%) compared with open aneurysm repair, despite the observation that TEVAR invariably covers intercostal
