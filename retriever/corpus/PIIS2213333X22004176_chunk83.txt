Rationale. For patients who elect a staged approach,
signiﬁcant time must elapse after the procedure to
differentiate between the symptoms related to recovery
from the original procedure and residual symptoms from
remaining venous insufﬁciency. We recommend followup for a minimum of 3 months to determine whether
the procedure has both resolved the symptoms and
eliminated visible tributary veins. Longer follow-up is
recommended for patients with recurrent symptoms
and those participating in clinical trials. In patients with
residual symptoms, DU should be performed to assess
the treated veins for closure and to assess any remaining
superﬁcial truncal veins, tributaries, and perforator veins
for the size and extent of reﬂux. Once identiﬁed, treatment with a second procedure should use the same
criteria as used for the initial procedure. Treatment can
range from ablation of an incompletely closed or more
distal truncal vein to removal or sclerotherapy of any
remaining incompetent tributary veins.
Evidence. In two studies, the follow-up evaluation was
performed at 3 to 6 months to fully assess potential
regression of the tributary varicosities, with signiﬁcant
regression and improvement in symptoms.211,212 In
