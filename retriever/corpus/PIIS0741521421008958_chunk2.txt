Extracranial carotid artery disease occurs owing to
progression of atheromatous plaque which mainly affects the carotid bifurcation, and results in narrowing
or blockade of the arterial lumen. This can be an
asymptomatic process and found incidentally, or the
patient may present with an ischemic stroke or

transient ischemic attack. Stroke is one of the leading
causes of morbidity, disability and mortality. It is the
cause for about 140,000 deaths each year in the
United States.1 Poststroke care in the United States is
a huge economic burden and can reach $4850 per
patient month.2
