ABSTRACT
Management of carotid bifurcation stenosis in stroke prevention has been the subject of extensive investigations, including
multiple randomized controlled trials. The proper treatment of patients with carotid bifurcation disease is of major interest
to vascular surgeons and other vascular specialists. In 2011, the Society for Vascular Surgery published guidelines for the
treatment of carotid artery disease. At the time, several randomized trials, comparing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and
carotid artery stenting (CAS), were reported. Since the 2011 guidelines, several studies and a few systematic reviews
comparing CEA and CAS have been reported, and the role of medical management has been reemphasized. In the present
publication, we have updated and expanded on the 2011 guidelines with speciﬁc emphasis on ﬁve areas: (1) is CEA recommended over maximal medical therapy for low-risk patients; (2) is CEA recommended over transfemoral CAS for low
surgical risk patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis of >50%; (3) the timing of carotid intervention for patients
presenting with acute stroke; (4) screening for carotid artery stenosis in asymptomatic patients; and (5) the optimal
sequence of intervention for patients with combined carotid and coronary artery disease.
