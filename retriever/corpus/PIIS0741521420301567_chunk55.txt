 successful endovascular techniques have included
coil or glue embolization, percutaneous or open thrombin
injection, and endovascular stent grafting.3,124-129 One
report of ﬁve cases of endovascular occlusion of CAA
revealed no ischemic sequelae and uniformly good technical results.130 Late coil migration into the stomach with
development of a fatal aortogastric ﬁstula has been reported after coil embolization of a CAA.131 However, there
are signiﬁcantly fewer reports in the literature of CAAs being
treated by endovascular techniques compared with SAAs.
Because CAAs typically involve the proximal portion of the
celiac trunk, absence of a proximal landing zone may limit
endovascular treatment with coils.99,107 This can be potentially achieved with embolization using endovascular
plugs, which can allow a more controlled and precise occlusion of the celiac axis.
Roberts et al132 reported on a series of emergently
treated hemorrhaging celiac or mesenteric artery aneurysms using an initial endovascular approach to all patients in whom the diagnosis was made on
preoperative imaging studies. Ultimately, open surgical
treatment was required in <5% of cases.

CAAs are associated with other visceral artery aneurysms in 40% of cases and with aortic aneurysms in
20% of cases.133,134 Of patients with a CAA, 18% to
20% will have an aortic aneurysm, and 18% to 38%
will have an additional visceral artery aneurysm.135 Peripheral artery aneurysms are seen in 18% to 67% of
patients.117
