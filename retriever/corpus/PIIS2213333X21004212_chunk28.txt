% CI, 2.06-10.85; and RR, 26.67;
95% CI, 1.53-465.40, respectively). HL/S was associated with
a lower risk of skin burn (RR, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.00-0.51). There
were no signiﬁcant differences for outcomes such as DVT
or QoL scores when HL/S compared with EVLA. Outcomes
are presented in Supplementary Table V (online only).
Key Question 3. Thermal ablation vs nonthermal
ablation
Thermal ablations included RFA and EVLA. Nonthermal
ablations included CAC, MOCA, and UGFS using sodium
tetradecyl sulfate or polidocanol to prepare the foam at
the bedside using the Tessari technique or physician using injectable polidocanol foam (Varisolve/Varithena). We
included 16 RCTs (27 publications)74-91,100-108 enrolling
4159 patients, and 11 comparative observational
studies92-99,109-111 enrolling 2390 patients. Fourteen RCTs
(24 publications)76,77,79,81-91,100-108,120 had an intermediate
overall risk of bias, two RCTs (3 publications)74,75,80 had a
high risk of bias, mainly owing to inadequate randomization, inadequate random sequence generation, allocation concealment, unclear blinding of outcome
assessors, possible selective reporting, and other sources
of bias such as funding sources. Five observational
studies94,96,98,99,111 had an intermediate overall risk of
bias, and six observational studies92,93,95,97,109,110 had a
low risk of bias. The mean age was 47.5 years, with
59.5% women. Most of the patients had CEAP classiﬁcation of C2 to C6 (Supplementary Tables I-III, online only).
