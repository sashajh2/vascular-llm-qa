 effect on work). However, the
change in the scores was higher for the ablation plus
phlebectomy group than for the ablation alone group.
Conway et al209 in a 2020 study of data from the varicose vein module of the American Venous Registry
examined 526 patients with CEAP clinical class C2
without prior venous treatment. Combined treatment
(CT) in this cohort consisted of phlebectomy or sclerotherapy, and unimodal treatment was thermal ablation
(RFA or laser). The change in symptom severity was
assessed by the pretreatment and 1-month posttreatment VCSSs. After treatment, CT was associated
with signiﬁcantly lower scores for the pain component
of the VCSS (0.31 for unimodal treatment vs 0.07 for CT;
P ¼ .0008).
From England, the AVULS (ambulatory varicosity avulsion later or synchronized) trial compared simultaneous
and staged treatment, with the Aberdeen Varicose Vein
Questionnaire score as the primary outcome.210 Both
groups showed signiﬁcant improvement in symptoms
from baseline at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months
(P < .0001). Although a signiﬁcant difference was seen
at 6 weeks, with the simultaneous group showing a
5.48-point improvement (P ¼ .029), no signiﬁcant differences were found at 6 and 12 months. Comparing the
staged group who had subsequently required further
treatment and the simultaneous group, a large signiﬁcant difference was found at 6 weeks and 6 months.
The difference was no longer signiﬁcant, however, at
12 months.
Guideline 5.2.
5.2.1. For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the GSV
or SSV, we suggest ablation of the reﬂuxing venous
trunk and staged or UGFS of the varicosities only if
anatomic or medical reasons are present. We suggest
shared decision-making with the patient.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak); quality of
evidence: C (low to very low)
