 for patients treated medically; aggregate risk reduction, 53%;
95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 22%-72%).2 The ACAS recommended CEA for patients aged <80 years as long as
the expected combined stroke and mortality rate for
the individual surgeon was not >3%. The conclusions
from the ACAS were supported by a subsequent larger
RCT that had randomized 3120 patients to immediate
CEA vs medical therapy.5 That trial also showed an advantage in limiting stroke and death at 5 years for CEA
compared with maximal medical therapy (4.1% vs 10.0%;
95% CI, 4.0%-7.8%). The long-term effectiveness of CEA
for asymptomatic patients was conﬁrmed by the longterm results of the ACST, as reported by Halliday et al.23
That trial had compared CEA and a medical arm, in which
patients had primarily received antithrombotic and antihypertensive therapy. The results showed that the CEA
arm (patients aged <75 years) experienced signiﬁcantly
lower perioperative and 10-year stroke rates (13.3% vs
17.9%).23 The strength of these conclusions has been questioned owing to the relatively modest absolute beneﬁts of
CEA and the contention that the medical therapy arm did
not reﬂect contemporary medical management.24,25 The
question of whether modern medical therapy (including
statins) is equivalent or superior to CEA or CAS has not
yet been addressed by well-designed, appropriately
funded, prospective, multicenter, and randomized trials.
However, when the stroke rate of the patients receiving
lipid-lowering medication in the ACST trial was analyzed,
the patients who had undergone CEA with lipid-lowering
medication had a lower stroke incidence compared with
the medical therapy arm. However, the effect of CEA was
not as great (0.7% vs 1.3% annually; P < .0001) for those
receiving lipid-lowering therapy compared with 1.8% vs
3.3% annually (P < .0001) for those not receiving lipidlowering therapy.23
More recently, Howard et al26 conducted a prospective
