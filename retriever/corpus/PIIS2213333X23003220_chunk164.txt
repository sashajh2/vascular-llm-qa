 Those
receiving full-dose anticoagulation received a longer
course of treatment and all patients were followed for
3 months. There was no difference in the incidence of
VTE or recurrent SVT between the groups or in the safety
outcomes of major bleeding or clinically nonmajor
bleeding. The authors concluded that these ﬁndings
are hypothesis generating and support a trial evaluating
the efﬁcacy of preventative dose anticoagulation in

comparison with therapeutic anticoagulation for treatment of SVT approaching the SFJ.
There is a paucity of studies speciﬁcally evaluating
the management of SVT in patients with varicose
veins. In a prospective observational study of 195 limbs
with SVT and varicose veins treated with surgery or
anticoagulation, there was no difference in the primary composite outcome of SVT extension/recurrence, incidence of DVT or symptomatic PE.256 The
authors concluded that urgent surgery is not associated with reduction in the incidence of VTE
compared with anticoagulation alone but could be
safely performed in selected patients with isolated
thrombosis of varicose tributaries or limited involvement of the saphenous trunk.
A single-center randomized trial of 73 patients
compared the use of thigh-high 23 to 32 mm Hg
compression stockings to no compression stockings for
3 weeks in patients with isolated SVT of the legs who
all received prophylactic dose LMWH with or without
NSAIDS.261 The addition of compression stockings
resulted in no signiﬁcant difference in reduction of
pain, consumption of analgesics, thrombus length, skin
erythema, D-dimer, or QOL. However, patients wearing
compression had signiﬁcantly faster thrombus regression at 7 days.
The recurrence rate of SVT is between 10 and 20%. One
large case series of SVT patients described a recurrence
rate of 15% among 221 patients.262 In modern times
with widespread application of anticoagulant therapies,
the risk of recurrence or VTE is w6%, with the highest
risk occurring among patients with previous episodes
of SVT and long segment thrombosis.263 Although not
