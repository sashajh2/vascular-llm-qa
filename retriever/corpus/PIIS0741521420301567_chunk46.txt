SAAs may be multiple and may be found in association
with other visceral and nonvisceral aneurysms. In a review of 212 cases of SAAs seen during a two-decade
period at a single institution, 3.3% of patients were found
to have concomitant visceral aneurysms, with the most
common location being extrahepatic (2.3%) and additionally including aneurysms in the celiac, superior
mesenteric, gastric, and pancreaticoduodenal territories.108 In addition, 14.3% of patients were found to
have concomitant nonvisceral aneurysms, with the
most common location being renal (7.4%) and abdominal aortic (3.7%) and additionally including aneurysms
in the carotid, intracerebral, thoracic aortic, and popliteal
territories.108
SAAs selected for conservative management with
observation require surveillance to assess for progression
and size growth. The mode of assessment and the
appropriate imaging technique depend on the visibility
of the aneurysm to the various imaging techniques available.84 CT or ultrasound should be performed every
12 months; CT is generally preferred because of the
detailed cross-sectional imaging provided, and it can
be done with or without contrast enhancement.84
This strategy appears to be safe on the basis of the literature described earlier from the Mayo Clinic94 and the
