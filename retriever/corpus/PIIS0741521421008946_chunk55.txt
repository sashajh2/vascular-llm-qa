that both procedures have similar midterm outcomes.
However, long-term outcomes continue to favor CEA
because of its lower periprocedural stroke and death
rate. In addition, 10-year outcomes comparing CEA and
transfemoral CAS have been published. In symptomatic
patients from CREST, a combined end point of periprocedural stroke and death and 10-year ipsilateral stroke was
7.9% (95% CI, 5.9-10.0) in patients treated with CEA vs
11% (95% CI, 8.5-13.9; HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.01-1.86) in patients
treated with CAS (P ¼ .04).203 A 2020 Cochrane Review
also showed the combination end point of periprocedural
death or stroke or ipsilateral stroke during follow-up was
signiﬁcantly lower with CEA.202
Despite the evidence, there is concern regarding
whether data from randomized controlled trials of CAS
can be extrapolated to real-world experience. In general,
physicians who performed carotid stenting in these trials
were highly experienced and their outcomes were rigorously assessed before they were allowed to enroll patients.204 By contrast, in a review of physicians treating
Medicare beneﬁciaries with CAS, fewer than 10% would
meet criteria to participate in CREST based on low volume or high complication rate.205 It is unclear if similar
results will be obtained for CAS among clinicians who
are less experienced or among patients who would not
meet inclusion criteria for the clinical trial. Nolan
et al206 reviewed data from the Northern New England
Vascular Registry and showed a higher risk of stroke
and death in symptomatic patients treated with CAS
compared with CEA (5.1% CAS vs 1.6% CEA; P ¼ .001).
Last, in a study by Hicks et al200 looking at almost
52,000 carotid procedures in the VQI, symptomatic
high risk patients deﬁned using Medicare criteria) had a
2.3% risk of stroke and death following CEA vs 3.6%
