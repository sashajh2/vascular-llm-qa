 reported results of a single-center RCT
comparing laser ablation (810-nm laser) with stripping of
the GSV in 100 patients, including high ligation and phlebectomies performed in both groups. Follow-up was 4
months. Fewer postoperative hematomas occurred in the
laser group, but pain and sick leave time after EVLA were
longer than after surgery (20 days vs 14 days; P ⬍ .05). The
study concluded that short-term QOL is equal after both
procedures but that longer follow-up is needed to decide
which is a better choice for the patients.
Pronk et al275 compared HL/S with EVLA using a
980-nm laser energy; 130 legs in 121 patients were randomized. In this study, more pain was noted after EVLA at
days 7, 10, and 14 (P ⬍ .01; P ⬍ .01; P ⫽ .01), more

hindrance in mobility at days 7 (P ⬍ .01) and 10 (P ⫽ .01),
and in self-care (P ⫽ .03) and daily activities (P ⫽ .01) at
day 7 compared with HL/S. Recurrence at 1 year was
similar in the two groups.
Christenson et al250 recently reported 2-year data of an
RCT using 980-nm laser for EVLA and compared results
with HL/S in 204 randomized patients. Additional phlebectomies or perforator ligations were also performed in
both groups. HL/S limbs had significantly more postoperative hematomas than EVLT limbs. Two GSVs in the
EVLT group reopened and five partially reopened, but no
open GSVs occurred in HL/S limbs. The authors concluded that long-term follow-up is still needed to justify
EVLA vs HL/S.
The Committee noted that four of the seven trials had
short follow-up and two trials had funding from a commercial company. Overall, the quality of evidence for safety and
early efficacy was high, but evidence for long-term effectiveness in these
