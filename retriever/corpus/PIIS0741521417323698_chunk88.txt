mesenteric artery based off of a large IMA, which will be
sacriﬁced during the course of treatment.

We suggest preservation of accessory renal arteries at the time
of EVAR or OSR if the artery is 3 mm or larger in diameter or
supplies more than one-third of the renal parenchyma.

Perioperative outcomes of elective EVAR
Incidence of 30-day and in-hospital mortality. The UK
EVAR 1, Dutch Randomized Endovascular Aneurysm
Management (DREAM), U.S. Veterans Affairs Open Versus
Endovascular Repair (OVER), and French Anevrysme de
l’aorte abdominale: Chirurgie versus Endoprothese
(ACE) multicenter randomized trials collectively randomized 2790 patients to EVAR or open repair.359-362 The two
largest trials (EVAR 1 and OVER) demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant mortality beneﬁt with EVAR, and
pooled analysis from all four trials conﬁrmed the beneﬁt
of EVAR with a mortality of 1.4% compared with 4.2% for
open surgery (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.22-0.50; P < .0001).363
A review of 79,932 Medicare patients conﬁrmed that
these results are representative of current outcomes,
with an overall mortality of 5.2% for open repair and 1.6%
for EVAR (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.95-3.51).364 Outcomes after
AAA repair are related to experience. Whereas earlier
studies365,366 suggested that the minimum hospital
threshold for optimal outcomes is 8 to 10 EVAR cases per
year, a recent risk-adjusted analysis of 122,495 Medicare
patients undergoing elective EVAR between 2001 and
2008 observed that operative mortality is directly related
