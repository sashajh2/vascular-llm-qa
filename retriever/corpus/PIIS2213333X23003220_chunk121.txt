 reﬂux at the SFJ or SPJ and at sites of potential incompetent perforating veins should be investigated. DUS can
identify reﬂuxing, recanalized axial veins, and residual
saphenous stumps but it only has a sensitivity of 62%
and a positive predictive value of only 26% to correctly
identify neovascularization.215
Recurrent varicose veins after surgery have been reported to occur between 6.6% to 37.0% at 2 years and
upwards of 50% at 5 years.7 We recommend that all patients who have undergone a venous intervention for
varicose veins have at least one follow-up visit when
symptoms related to the procedure are likely to have
resolved and interval healing has occurred. Any residual
symptoms or problematic residual varicose veins should
be reassessed and documented. Reevaluation after 3
months may be patient initiated based on recurrent
symptoms.

9.1.2 For patients with symptomatic recurrent varicosities due to persistent or recurrent reﬂux of the
GSV or AAGSV, treatment either with open surgical
or endovascular techniques may be performed, with
good outcomes expected.
Consensus statement.
Rationale and evidence. Theivacumar et al treated 64
patients with EVLA of the above knee (above-knee)
GSV. Above-knee-GSV EVLA improved symptoms
regardless of persisting below-knee reﬂux; the latter,
however, was responsible for residual symptoms and a
greater need for sclerotherapy for residual varicosities.153
A systematic review in 2021 investigated the incidence
of below-knee residual reﬂux in patients who underwent
ablation of the GSV.33 HL&S in the above-knee GSV (6
studies, 525 limbs), as well as EVLA, above-knee only (7
studies, 696 limbs) and above-kneeþbelow-knee ablation (2 studies, 147 limbs), were included. The authors
