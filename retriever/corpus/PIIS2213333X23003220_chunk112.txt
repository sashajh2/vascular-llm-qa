complications were less in the CO2 group, VDs were not
signiﬁcantly different, but conclusion are limited by the
small sample size.
Willenburg et al204 conducted a systemic review evaluating VD following sclerotherapy of varicose veins, reticular
veins and telangiectasias. While the prevalence of VD was
difﬁcult to determine, two RCTs reported no VDs (95 and
75 patients treated, respectively). In large case series
(>500 patients), the prevalence of VD ranged from
0.09% to 2%. In a meta-analysis that included over 9000
patients, Jia et al10 found the median rates of VDs and
headache were 1.4% and 4.2%, respectively. Chest

tightness and coughing occurred in <1%. Room air and
CO2-created foams were included in this metanalysis. Gillet et al205 evaluated the side-effects and complications of
FS in a prospective, multicenter study of room air vs oxygen FS in 1025 patients. The incidence of migraine was
0.78% (with aura 0.59%, 0.19% without aura), VD 0.68%,
chest tightness 0.68%, chest tightness with VD 0.49%
