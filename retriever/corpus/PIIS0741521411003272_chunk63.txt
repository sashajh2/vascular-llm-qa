 the source of the reflux underlying a
varicose venous cluster formation. Instrumentation includes a central power unit with controls for irrigation
pump and resection oscillation speeds, an illuminator hand
piece that connects to the control unit using a fiber optic
cable and provides high-intensity light for transillumination
and delivery of tumescence irrigation, and a resector hand
piece that has 4.5-mm and 5.5-mm options.
General, epidural, or spinal anesthesia can be used,
depending on patient preference, while local tumescence
anesthesia and conscious sedation may be options for limited varicosities in selected patients. In the procedure, TIPP
instruments are introduced through tiny incisions. The
illuminator produces transilluminated visualization of the
veins to be removed, allows delivery of tumescent anesthetic solution, and performs hydrodissection. Through
segmental counterincisions under direct visualization, the
resector is positioned directly on the varicosity, and with
powered endoscopic dissection, varicosities are mobilized
free and then suctioned out of the leg. The addition of small
1.5-mm punch incisions allows for blood that collects in
the vein tract to be flushed out with further tumescent
anesthetic fluid.184-186
Preservation of the GSV. Preservation of the saphenous vein and treatment of varicose tributaries by phlebectomy has been advocated by Francesci in the CHIVA (cure
conservatrice et hémodynamique de l’insuffisance veineuse en
ambulatiore [ambulatory conservative hemodynamic management of varicose veins]) technique186-189 and by Pittaluga in the ASVAL (ablation sélective des varices sous anesthésie locale [ie ambulatory selective varicose vein ablation
under local anesthesia]) technique.126
The CHIVA technique. The CHIVA technique is a
hemodynamic approach to varicose veins based on the
principles of preserving the saphenous vein and venous
drainage into the deep system.186,190 The goal of CHIVA
