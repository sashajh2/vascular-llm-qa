 study from Germany
including 31,619 patients, venous reﬂux was the causative
factor in 47.6%, arterial insufﬁciency in 14.5%, and combined arterial and venous reﬂux in 17.6%. Rarer causes
included vasculitis (5.1%), exogenous factors (3.8%), pyoderma gangrenosum (3.0%), infection (1.4%), neoplasia
