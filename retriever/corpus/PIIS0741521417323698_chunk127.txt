 avoided admission to
ICU by use of systematic preoperative evaluation to
identify predictors of poor outcome.600
Goal-directed therapy using noninvasive monitoring of
cardiac output by esophageal Doppler or lithium indicator dilution and pulse power analysis has been shown to
improve short-term outcomes.601,602 Monitoring cardiac
output with a deﬁned treatment protocol has also
been shown to be cost-effective in the setting of major
abdominal surgery.603 Whereas studies focused on the
care of patients with an aortic aneurysm have not been
conducted, randomized trials have included patients
with vascular disease.604
Fast-track surgical pathways or “enhanced recovery”
pathways are being used increasingly to decrease length
of stay and to expedite discharge after abdominal surgery. Evaluation of a fast-track surgery pathway in a 30patient cohort undergoing open aneurysm repair was
associated with an average length of stay of 3.6 days
without readmission.605 The pathway included a limited
retroperitoneal incision and specialized intraoperative retractors.605 A recent trial conﬁrmed beneﬁt in 101 patients randomized to a fast-track surgery care pathway,
which included no bowel preparation, reduced fasting,
and patient-controlled anesthesia as well as early mobilization and feeding. There was no difference in ICU
length of stay, but time to full feeding (5 vs 7 days; P <
.001) was reduced along with the incidence of postoperative complication (16% vs 36%; P ¼ .039).
We recommend postoperative management in an ICU for the
patient with signiﬁcant cardiac, pulmonary, or renal disease
as well as for those requiring postoperative mechanical
ventilation or who developed a signiﬁcant arrhythmia or
hemodynamic instability during operative treatment.
