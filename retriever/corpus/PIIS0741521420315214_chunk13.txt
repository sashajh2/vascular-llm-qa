 B (Moderate)
Recommendation 33: We recommend the use of iliac
conduits or direct iliac/aortic punctures for TEVAR delivery to facilitate access in patients with small (relative to
the chosen device), tortuous, or calciﬁed iliac vessels.
The decision to perform a conduit should be made in
the preoperative setting, when possible. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B
(Moderate)
Recommendation 34: We suggest that endoconduits
to facilitate access for TEVAR are an acceptable alternative to an open iliac conduit in some cases, but few

data comparing them with an iliac conduit or long-term
data describing their outcomes over time are available.
Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of
Evidence: C (Low)
Recommendation 35: We recommend TEVAR over
open repair for the treatment of ruptured DTA when
anatomically feasible. Level of recommendation: Grade
1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 36: We recommend contrastenhanced CT scanning at 1 month and 12 months after
TEVAR and then yearly for life, with consideration of
more frequent imaging if an endoleak or other abnormality of concern is detected at 1 month. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B

DEVELOPMENT OF GUIDELINES
The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) thoracic
endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) guidelines committee was created by ﬁrst soliciting interest among
members of the SVS. The committee and Chair
were then chosen by the SVS to ensure that the
number of authors without documented conﬂicts of
interest was greater than or equal to the number
with reported conﬂicts of interest. Importantly, these
guidelines are speciﬁc for lesions isolated to the
descending thoracic aorta (DTA) that require coverage
of zones 2 to 6.3 Those patients with aortic disease
within the aortic arch requiring coverage at or proximal to the left carotid artery (zone 0 or zone 1) are
