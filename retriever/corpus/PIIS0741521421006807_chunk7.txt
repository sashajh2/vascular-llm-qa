Tabular review of series of
PAA patients

Variable

In >2600 patients from studies
reported in previous 25 years, average
rate of bilateral PAA was 48% and of
concomitant AAA was 38%

Mix of mostly
retrospective and a
few prospective
studies

Recommendation 2:We recommend that patients with an asymptomatic PAA >20 mm in diameter should undergo repair to reduce the
risk of thromboembolic complications and limb loss (grade 1B). For selected patients at higher clinical risk, repair can be deferred until
the PAA has become >30 mm, especially in the absence of thrombus (grade 2C)

Asymptomatic PAAs treated
for $1 year of medical and
observational
management before repair

Variable

87 PAAs in 65 patients were evaluated;
mean initial diameter at diagnosis
was 16.9 mm; multivariable analysis
determined that initial diameter (OR,
5.53; P ¼ .007) and presence or
development of mural thrombus
(OR, 4.00; P ¼ .008) independently
predicted for PAA diameter growth

Retrospective study

1994

Consecutive patients with
symptomatic or
asymptomatic PAAs

Variable

161 PAAs in 106 patients were followed
up for a mean of 6.7 years (range,
3 days to 12.1 years); 15 limbs
presented with acute symptoms, 52
with chronic symptoms, and 94 were
asymptomatic; $1 of 3 risk factors
(size, >2 cm, thrombus, poor runoff)
was initially present in 11 of 12 limbs
(91.7%) compared with 9 of 24 control
limbs (37.5%) that remained
asymptomatic (P < .05)
