The concept behind compression is to reduce edema
and inﬂammation related to venous hypertension in the
lower limbs, particularly in the gaiter region, where
VLUs are most likely to develop. Patients may progress
from C2 to C3-C6 at 2% per year.501 Patients with C3-4
disease have a moderate risk of progressing to venous stasis
ulceration, depending on their comorbidities and lifestyle
habits.502 One study has shown that approximately one
third of patients with signiﬁcant reﬂux progress in CEAP
class during 19 months.503 Several risk factors for progression have been identiﬁed. Obese patients who stand for
prolonged periods may be at higher risk than active nonobese patients, whereas patients with altered iron metabolism
have been shown to have an increased risk for VLU.55
Unfortunately, there are no prospective studies of large
populations that deﬁne the risk of progression to C6
disease.504
Typically, limbs that go on to ulcerate have signiﬁcantly
worse ejection fraction and increased residual volume fraction by air plethysmography.505 Improvement in calf muscle function (ejection fraction) and reduced residual
volume fraction are the primary mechanisms of compression.506,507 A recent meta-analysis showed that leg symptoms, primarily pain and edema, are also signiﬁcantly
improved with use of compression.508 The types of
compression as well as the length and grade of the garment
vary among the different manufacturers. Overall, no evidence exists that one type of compression, duration, or
stocking length is more efﬁcacious than any other. Negative gradient compression hose with up to 60 mm Hg
calf and 50 mm Hg foot are associated with improvement
in calf muscle pump function compared with graduated
compression.509,510
We recommend 20 to 30 mm Hg compression with
the length (knee high or thigh high) determined by patient
preference. Compliance with compression is important for
its beneﬁcial effect yet may not always be well documented
or emphasized. D
