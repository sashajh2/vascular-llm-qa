161 patients from
7 hospitals during a 15-year period showed a lower incidence of the composite end point of stroke, paraplegia,
and death in the TEVAR cohort compared with open
repair (36.2% vs 21.7%; P < .05), but no difference was
seen in the individual outcomes because of small
numbers.204 Long-term outcomes have been reasonable
after TEVAR for ruptured DTA. A review of 21 patients
treated with TEVAR with a median follow-up of
>5 years reported a late mortality of 52% with only one
known aorta-related death.205
Most of the large series evaluating TEVAR for ruptured
DTA are from administrative databases, such as Medicare
and the National Inpatient Sample, and lack the
anatomic granularity that would allow meaningful comparison of the cohort of patients undergoing each procedure (open TAA repair vs TEVAR). In addition, it is
difÔ¨Åcult to determine the state of the patient at the
time of presentation as it is possible that one approach
is favored in stable patients and another is used when
a patient presents in extremis. Within these limitations,
it appears that TEVAR for ruptured DTA is associated
with improved survival and lower morbidity compared
with open repair.5
Recommendation 35: We recommend TEVAR over
open repair for the treatment of ruptured DTA when it
is anatomically feasible. Level of recommendation:
Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)

SURVEILLANCE AFTER TEVAR
Surveillance after TEVAR is critical to identify endoleaks
after initial placement and to evaluate whether longterm complications appear, such as migration, aneurysm
expansion despite no evidence of endoleak (type V endoleak, so-called endotension), new endoleaks, device failure (fracture, migration, component separation),
stenosis, or occlusion. In addition, long-term evaluation
may detect signs of graft infection. The most often reported protocol after TEVAR for aneurysm surveillance
is clinical examination and CT scans at 1 month,
6 months, and yearly thereafter.206,207 When TEVAR is
placed for emergent indications, earlier evaluation either
during hospitalization or within 1 week of placement
