Endoconduit. In an effort to avoid the potential
increased morbidity and operative time associated with
a retroperitoneal exposure of the common iliac vessels or
distal aorta, the use of angioplasty and stenting as an
endoconduit has been reported.192 In general, a 10-mm
self-expanding covered stent graft is placed, but others
have advocated placing an EVAR limb with at least a 12mm distal diameter as an endoconduit. This can then be
dilated with balloon angioplasty to an appropriate size.
Some authors have advocated for intentional rupture of
the iliac vessel within the stent grafted portion, given that
the vessel wall or atherosclerosis can continue to impede
device delivery even after endoconduit placement, especially when there is bulky calciÔ¨Åc disease.193
In a retrospective series comparing open iliac conduit
with endoconduit including 39 patients (23 open conduits, 16 endoconduits), the iliofemoral complication
rate was 20% for the entire cohort, but it was lower in
the endoconduit group compared with the open
conduit (12.5% vs 26.1%). This was not statistically
different secondary to small numbers of patients.194
Other published experiences with this technique include
small cohorts of patients.195-197

Recommendation 34: We suggest that endoconduits
to facilitate access for TEVAR are an acceptable alternative to an open iliac conduit in some cases, but few
data comparing them with an iliac conduit or longterm data describing their outcomes over time are available. Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low)
Carotid-axillary access. Use of the carotid and axillary
arteries to deliver and to deploy thoracic stent grafts
has been described,198 but these cases have been
reserved for extreme situations in which access cannot
be obtained from the lower extremities because of iliac
or distal aortic
