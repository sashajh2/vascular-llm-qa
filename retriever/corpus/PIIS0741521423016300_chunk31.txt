PROGNOSIS
Clinical question. In a person with diabetes, suspected
PAD, and a foot ulcer or gangrene, which non-invasive
bedside tests, alone or in combination, at any time
point (including after revascularisation procedures), predict DFU healing, healing after minor amputation, and
major amputation?

Recommendation 6
In a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene,
consider performing ankle pressures and ankle brachial index
(ABI) measurements to assist in the assessment of likelihood
of healing and amputation.
Ankle pressure and ABI are weak predictors of healing. A low
ankle pressure (e.g., < 50 mmHg) or ABI (e.g., < 0.5) may be
associated with greater likelihood of impaired healing and
greater likelihood of major amputation.

Certainty of evidence
Low

Recommendation 7
In a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene,
consider performing a toe pressure measurement to assess
likelihood of healing and amputation.
A toe pressure $ 30 mmHg increases the pre-test probability
of healing by up to 30% and a value < 30 mmHg increases the
pre-test probability of major amputation by approximately
20%.

Conditional

Certainty of evidence
Low

Recommendation 8
In a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene, if a toe
pressure cannot be performed, consider performing a transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) measurement or a skin
perfusion pressure (SPP) to assess likelihood of healing.
A TcPO2 $ 25 mmHg increases the pre-test probability of
healing by up to 45% and value < 25 mmHg increases the
pre-test probability of major amputation by approximately
20%. An SPP $ 40 mmHg increases the pre-test probability of
healing by up to 30%.

Rationale. The presence of PAD constitutes a substantially increased risk of failure to heal and major lower

limb amputation for people with a diabetes related
foot ulcer or gangrene. Bedside testing results are an integral component of determining the severity of
ischaemia and, to that end, to determine the need
