 patients did not conﬁrm that
tight control of glucose levels decreased stroke risk.75
Further, no reduction in stroke risk was identiﬁed despite
achieving a hemoglobin A1c level of less than 6.5% in
either the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study,
the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes
study, or the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease:
Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation
trial.76-78 Nevertheless, among patients with carotid artery disease, hemoglobin A1c of less than 7% is recommended to reduce the development of microvascular
complications and possible macrovascular complications other than stroke.
Treatment of lipid abnormalities: Statin therapy
Although the relationship between hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease and MI are wellestablished, the data with respect to elevated cholesterol levels and stroke are somewhat conﬂicting.

Several studies identiﬁed increased incidence of stroke
among men and women with elevated cholesterol
levels,79-81 but a meta-analysis of 45 studies of hypercholesterolemic patents did not indicate an increased
risk of stroke.
Nonetheless, there is compelling evidence that
decreasing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels through
lipid-lowering therapy is highly effective in decreasing
stroke risk among patients with known atherosclerotic
disease. A meta-analysis of 28 randomized clinical trials
including more than 106,000 patients with nearly
50,000 randomized to statin medications, demonstrated
that in hyperlipidemic patients without a prior history of
stroke, statins were associated with a 15% to 30% decrease
in stroke incidence.82 A more recent meta-analysis of 26
trials including more than 90,000 patients with coronary
artery or other atherosclerotic disease demonstrated a
greater than 15% decrease in the rate of stroke for every
10% reduction in serum LDL.83 The 2006 Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels trial
was the ﬁrst study to demonstrate the beneﬁts of statin
therapy
