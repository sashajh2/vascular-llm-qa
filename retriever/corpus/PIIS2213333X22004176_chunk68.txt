1 week, 96.1% vs 100%; 1 month,
100% vs 97.1%; and 3, 6, and 12 months, 100% for both
groups). The investigators also reported no signiﬁcant differences in complications between the two groups at all
intervals.201

Additional studies that were not discussed in the systematic review included an RCT by Fitridge et al,202
who had evaluated the hemodynamic role of calf IPVs
in patients with uncomplicated varicose veins. They studied 38 limbs in 35 patients with incompetent GSVs and
one or more IPVs. All the limbs had undergone high ligation and saphenous stripping with or without phlebectomy with (group 1; n ¼ 21) or without (group 2; n ¼ 17)
open ligation of the IPV. In group 2, nine limbs had had
persistent IPVs, and eight had had no residual IPVs.
Both groups demonstrated signiﬁcant improvement of
venous function by air plethysmography postoperatively,
including the venous volume, venous ﬁlling index, and
ejection fraction. No signiﬁcant difference was found between the two groups in either the preoperative or postoperative venous function. Follow-up DU could not
identify previously seen IPVs in w50% of patients (8 of
17) who had not undergone open ligation of the IPVs.
This ﬁnding was explained as possible owing to avulsion
during surgery vs possible improvement in function after
pathologic saphenous vein removal.
In a prospective cohort study, Koroglu et al203
compared the effectiveness of endovenous laser ablation
and concomitant foam sclerotherapy in two groups of
patientsdone with isolated saphenous vein reﬂux (group
1; n ¼ 36 limbs) and one with saphenous vein reﬂux and
IPV (group 2; n ¼ 24 limbs); 21 of the 60
