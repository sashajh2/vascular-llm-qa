antly different between specialties:
7.1% for interventional radiologists, 6.7% for interventional
vascular medicine, 6.3% for vascular surgeons, and 3.1%
for interventional cardiologists (P ¼ .3121; 6.3% for vascular
surgeons and 3.8% for others combined; P ¼ .2469).
When physicians with less than 5 CAS/year were
excluded: the major adverse event rates were 6.7% for
interventional vascular medicine, 4.7% for vascular surgeons, and 3.1% for interventional cardiologists (P ¼
.5633). When physicians performing fewer than ﬁve CAS
per year were excluded, and the vascular surgeons alone
were compared with others, the MAE rates were 3.6% for
non-vascular surgeons vs 4.7% for vascular surgeons (P ¼
.5958). The major adverse event rate for high-volume providers was 4.0% vs 9.5% for low-volume providers, regardless of their specialty (P ¼ .1002). Logistic regression
analysis showed that for high-volume providers, the OR
of major adverse event rate was 0.4 (95% CI, 0.15-1.1; P ¼
.0674). The authors concluded that perioperative major
adverse event risks for CAS, regardless of specialties,
were similar across various providers, particularly for
vascular surgeons with similar volumes as nonvascular
surgeons. Low-volume providers had higher major
adverse event rates.

POSTCAROTID INTERVENTION SURVEILLANCE:
POST CEA AND POST STENTING
Surveillance after a carotid intervention is common
practice established on historical ipsilateral restenosis,
contralateral disease progression and associated stroke
risk. Traditional surveillance protocols for both CEA and
CAS have been very rigorous, including ultrasound examination follow-up at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months and annually
thereafter, with some variation in early postoperative surveillance.590-593
Early surveillance (eg, at 1-3 months), particularly when
intraoperative completion imaging has not been performed, helps to identify technical
