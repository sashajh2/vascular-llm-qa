 of the skin, subcutaneous tissue fibrosis (known as lipodermatosclerosis), and eventually,
ulceration.
Incompetence of the valves in the superficial venous system allows for retrograde fow of blood,
which is called “refux.” Failure of valves located at the junctions of the deep and superficial
systems can be a source of refux leading to CVI. For example, the great saphenous vein (GSV)
drains into the femoral vein at the saphenofemoral junction; a valve lies at this junction in
94% to 100% of individuals, and this is the most common site for clinically significant refux
(Moore, Lawrence, and Oderich 2019b). Obstruction of the deep venous system also limits the
outfow of blood resulting from an intrinsic process such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or
due to extrinsic compression. Deep venous outfow obstruction significantly contributes to the
pathogenesis of secondary CVD and has a more rapid progression of the disease with a high
rate of the development of ulcers (Eberhardt and Raffetto 2014a).
