Evidence. A systematic review by Farah et al19 analyzed
the data from 30 RCTs, reported in 44 studies,5-9,13,99,101-136
and the data from 16 observational studies11,137-151 that
had compared the results of surgical treatment with
those of endovenous ablation using any of the techniques. The systematic review found that high ligation
and saphenous stripping was associated with a lower
likelihood of being pain free (relative risk [RR], 0.39; 95%
conﬁdence interval [CI], 0.29-0.54)137,145 and an increased
need for analgesia (RR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.17-2.86)138,140 than
EVLA.19 In the CLASS (comparison of laser, surgery, and
foam sclerotherapy) RCT, which compared foam, laser,
and open surgical treatments, Brittenden et al99 reported signiﬁcantly fewer early adverse events after laser
ablation than after surgery (7% vs 1%; P < .001). Successful ablation of the saphenous vein, however, was less

group (P < .001). At 6 weeks, patients who had undergone surgery had had lower SF-36 (short-form 36-item)
scores, indicating worse generic QoL than that of those
who had undergone laser treatment. The differences
