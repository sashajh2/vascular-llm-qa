 for LSA coverage. Guidelines on
LSA revascularization were published in 2009 by the
SVS,127 yet there remains variability in this practice with
continued debate on the indications for revascularization.
Some surgeons perform revascularization routinely, some
selectively, and some perform LSA revascularization only
if symptoms occur after TEVAR.127,128 There are four major
concerns with coverage of the LSA: spinal cord ischemia,
stroke, arm ischemia, and vertebrobasilar ischemia.
Spinal cord ischemia. Understanding the anatomy of
the LSA branches and the critical anterior spinal artery
is important as the LSA provides inﬂow into the anterior
spinal artery through multiple pathways. There is general
consensus that patients with focal disease and who are
treated with shorter (#15 cm) stent graft lengths are at
lower risk for spinal cord ischemia.114,126 Data from the
European Collaborators on Stent/graft Techniques for
Aortic Aneurysm Repair (EUROSTAR) registry, one of the
largest series with speciﬁc attention to TEVAR and
anatomy, demonstrated rates of spinal cord ischemia
and stroke as high as 8.4% when there was LSA coverage
without revascularization compared with 0% in those
patients who underwent prophylactic LSA revascularization (P ¼ .049).109
After reports of lower spinal cord ischemia rates in
experimental, sequential, and progressive embolization
of spinal vessels in animal models,129 many have advocated for staging the coverage of large segments of the
aorta to allow preconditioning or even purposeful spinal
artery embolization before extensive TEVAR.130
Stroke. The incidence of stroke during and identiﬁed
after TEVAR for TAA generally ranges from 3.2% to
6.2%,131 and it may be lethal in one third of these
cases.132 However, this range may vary according to the
indication for TEVAR. A meta-analysis of the Cooksponsored multicenter trials demonstrated even lower
rates in certain populations of patients, with a 30-day
stroke rate of 0% in the 5
