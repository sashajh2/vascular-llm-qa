stenosis.
Recommendation 4.2 In selected asymptomatic patients who are at an increased risk of carotid stenosis,
we suggest screening for clinically asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, especially if patients are willing
to consider carotid intervention if signiﬁcant stenosis
is discovered (grade 2B). These high-risk groups include
Patients with lower extremity PAD
Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery
d Patients aged $55 years with at least two traditional
atherosclerotic risk factors
d Patients aged $55 years and active cigarette smoking
d Patients with diabetes, hypertension, or CAD
d Patients with clinically occult cerebral infarction noted
on brain imaging studies
d

Additional remarks.
1. In these patient cohorts, the presence of a carotid
bruit increases the likelihood of detecting signiﬁcant
stenosis
2. Asymptomatic individuals with an AAA or previous
radiotherapy to the neck who do not meet the criteria
for any of the high-risk groups noted above do not
require screening

Evidence and rationale
The most important features of imaging of carotid bifurcation disease are the degree of stenosis and the character
of the plaque.2,6,15,33,122 A greater degree of stenosis is generally thought to represent a progressively increased risk of
future stroke.6,33 However, plaque morphology also clearly
plays a signiﬁcant role.122 The morphologic features of the
plaque likely related to the risk of future stroke include heterogeneity, measurement of plaque area and juxtaluminal
black area, gray-scale median, and echogenicity.
