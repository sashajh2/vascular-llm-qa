non-contrast-enhanced MRA for diagnosis.

Technical remark: Non-contrast-enhanced MRA is best suited to children and
women of childbearing potential or those who have contraindications to CTA
or MRA contrast materials (ie, pregnancy, renal insufﬁciency, or gadolinium
contrast material allergy).

We recommend the use of catheter-based angiography for all emergent cases
presenting with rupture (Grade 1B) and electively for preoperative planning
(Grade 1C).

Gastric and gastroepiploic artery aneurysms account for
approximately 4% to 5% of all visceral aneurysms,
affecting men more frequently than women (three to
one).87 Etiologic risk factors include primarily arterial
dysplasia with segmental arterial mediolysis and periarterial inﬂammation like pancreatitis and vasculitis;
atherosclerosis, when present, is believed to be a secondary process.87,111,136 Axial imaging, ideally with CTA, remains the diagnostic study of choice as it detects
incidental and asymptomatic aneurysms and guides surgical and endovascular planning.137,138

supports catheter-based embolization of gastric and gastroepiploic artery aneurysms as the new standard of care,
with multiple case reports and small series documenting
successful aneurysm occlusion with coils and thrombin injection.1,2,141-143 Embolization for gastric and gastroepiploic
artery aneurysms, even ruptured, offers >90% technical
success and low morbidity and mortality. Stent grafting
has been described but remains anecdotal.1,144
Axial imaging as recommended will screen for
concomitant nonaortic intra-abdominal arterial aneurysms, which are common.136,139,145
