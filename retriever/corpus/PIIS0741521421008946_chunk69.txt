 anesthesia signiﬁcantly reduced perioperative complications,
however did admit the low use of regional anesthesia
may represent selection bias.
Results from randomized controlled trials, metaanalyses, and registries. One of the strongest Level 1 evidence sources on anesthesia is the General Anesthesia
vs Local Anesthesia for Carotid Surgery (GALA) trial.228
The two groups did not show any signiﬁcant differences regarding primary outcome (stroke, MI, or death)
(Table III), length of hospital stay, and quality of life.
Additionally, there was no difference in the primary
outcome in the subgroup analysis of age and baseline
surgical risk. The primary outcome rate for patients over
the age of 75 was 5.3% for general anesthesia vs 4.6% for
local anesthesia (P ¼ .741). This is in contrast with 4.5% for
local anesthesia vs 4.6% for general anesthesia for patients younger than the age of 75 (P ¼ .741). The primary
outcome rate for patients with high surgical risk was
4.6% for local anesthesia vs 4.1% for general anesthesia, in
contrast with 4.2% for local anesthesia vs 4.7% for general
anesthesia in patients with low surgical risk (P ¼ .933).
These results suggest that local anesthesia may be more
effective than general anesthesia for patients with
contralateral carotid occlusion. The primary outcome for
stroke, MI, or death at 30 days was 5% for local anesthesia
vs 10% for general anesthesia in patients with contralateral carotid occlusion (OR, 0.47; P ¼ .098) in contrast with
4.3% for general anesthesia and 4.5% for local anesthesia
in patients without contralateral carotid occlusion.
A Cochrane Review of the several randomized trials229-235 looking at anesthesia showed no evidence of
decreased perioperative strokes (2.7% for local

anesthesia vs 2.7% for general anesthesia; P ¼ .99). Use
of local anesthesia was also associated with a signiﬁcant
reduction in risk of 30-day perioperative local hemorrhage (OR, 0
