 in the compression group
(P ⬍ .02). The recurrence rate was 9% in the surgical group
and 38% in the compression group (P ⬍ .05). The study
excluded patients with post-thrombotic syndrome, deep
vein reflux or obstruction, or excessive ulcers (⬎12 cm).
In a recent open-label, single-center RCT, Pares et
al192 randomized 501 patients with primary varicose veins
into three arms: CHIVA, stripping with clinic marking, and
stripping with duplex marking. The primary end point was
recurrence within 5 years, assessed clinically by independent observers. Clinical outcomes in the CHIVA group
were better (44.3% cure, 24.6% improvement, 31.1% failure) than in the stripping with clinic marking (21.0% cure,
26.3% improvement, 52.7% failure) and stripping with
duplex marking (29.3% cure, 22.8% improvement, 47.9%
failure) groups. The OR between the stripping with clinic
marking and CHIVA groups, of recurrence at 5 years of
follow-up, was 2.64 (95% CI, 1.76-3.97; P ⬍ .001). The
OR of recurrence at 5 years between the stripping with
duplex marking and CHIVA group was 2.01 (95% CI,
1.34-3.00; P ⬍ .001).

Although the first two RCTs focused on a small group
of patients with varicose veins, the trial of Pares et al192
deserves credit for including the full spectrum of patients
with primary varicose veins. CHIVA is a complex approach,
and a high level of training and experience is needed to
attain the results presented in this RCT. However, the
results achieved by a few outstanding interventionists does
not support offering this procedure to all practitioners.
Although CHIVA has called attention to the importance
of directing surgical procedures toward the patient’s
venous anatomy and function, it still requires considerable education of venous
