Antimicrobials
We recommend against the routine use of topical
antimicrobial-containing dressings in the treatment of
noninfected venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL
OF EVIDENCE - A]
In the only prospective RCT of topical antibiotics, which
examined the treatment of noninfected VLUs, Michaels et al
randomized 213 patients with VLUs to silver-releasing dressings compared with non-silver-releasing dressings.247 No signiﬁcant difference in ulcer healing or other quality of life
measures was identiﬁed in the silver dressing group. Given
the increased cost of silver-containing dressings, routine use
of topical antimicrobial dressings for the treatment of VLUs
is not supported.248,249
Guideline 4.16: Periulcer Skin Management
We suggest application of skin lubricants underneath compression to reduce dermatitis that commonly
affects periulcer skin. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C] In severe cases of dermatitis associated
with venous leg ulcers, we suggest topical steroids to
reduce the development of secondary ulcerations and
to reduce the symptoms of dermatitis. [GRADE - 2;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Management of dermatitis and other abnormalities of
the periulcer skin is an important adjunct to other therapies
in the treatment of VLUs.250 Venous hypertension may
cause signiﬁcant dermatitis in the calf and ankle that may
be ameliorated with a variety of skin lubricants and other

agents. Contact dermatitis related to the dressings and
other products used to treat VLUs is also frequent. Recognizing this problem and treating it expeditiously will prevent secondary skin ulceration complicating the primary
leg ulcer.251,252 Consultation from dermatology may be
useful in long-standing or recurrent cases experiencing
sensitivity to wound treatment products.
Guideline 4.17: Anti-inﬂammatory Therapies
We suggest against use of anti-inﬂammatory therapies for the treatment of venous leg ulcers. [GRADE 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
