 veins in
patients with varicose veins (CEAP clinical class C2) includes those with an outward ﬂow duration of
$500 ms and a diameter of $3.5 mm on DU.
For patients with CVD (CEAP class C2-C6), the minimal
values suggested for clinically signiﬁcant incompetent
perforating veins (IPVs) were 350 ms and 500 ms.56,58,59
Most guidelines and consensus documents have agreed,
however, to deﬁne perforating vein incompetence as
>500-ms outward ﬂow during calf relaxation or release
after distal compression.20,38,39 Labropoulos et al60 reported 96% speciﬁcity and 73% sensitivity for DU scanning in predicting for incompetence of the perforating

veins in patients with a vein diameter of 3.9 mm. In their
study, one third of the incompetent perforator veins
(IPVs) were <3.9 mm in size. Sandri et al,61 however, reported that >90% of the IPVs were >3.5 mm in size.
The SVS/AVF venous guidelines deﬁned “pathologic”
perforating veins as those with an outward ﬂow of
>500 ms, with a diameter of $3.5 mm, located beneath
a healed or open venous ulcer (for patients with CEAP
class C5-C6).20,23,38 For C4 patients, IPVs should be
beneath areas of impending skin breakdown or areas
of skin vulnerability.38 These recommendations remain
current.
Guideline 1.2.
1.2.1. We recommend that evaluation of reﬂux with DU
be performed in an Intersocietal Accreditation
Commissione or American College of Radiologye
accredited vascular laboratory by a credentialed ultrasonographer, with the patient standing whenever possible.
A sitting or reverse Trendelenburg position can be used if
the patient cannot stand.
Level of recommendation: ungraded good practice
