 MARADONA (mechanochemical endovenous ablation to radiofrequency ablation in
the treatment of primary great saphenous vein incompetence) RCT, with 213 randomized patients, mechanochemical ablation resulted in less postoperative pain
but more hyperpigmentation compared with RFA.174
More anatomic failures had been reported after the
MOCA procedure than after RFA; however, the patients
in both groups had had similar QoL scores at 1 and
2 years. In the LAMA (randomized controlled trial of
endovenous laser ablation versus mechanochemical
ablation with ClariVein in the management of superﬁcial
venous incompetence) trial, 150 patients had been randomized to EVLA or the MOCA procedure. Similar low
intraprocedural pain scores (RR, 22; 95% CI, 9-44; vs RR,
15; 95% CI, 9-29; P ¼ 0.210) were reported after both procedures. At 1 year, the anatomic occlusion rates after
EVLA were signiﬁcantly better than those after MOCA
(91% vs 77%; P ¼ .020). Both EVLA and MOCA were highly
efﬁcacious at 2 years and both had signiﬁcantly
improved disease severity, symptoms, and QoL. In
another RCT by Tawﬁk et al,182 100 patients had been
randomized to laser therapy or the MOCA procedure.
MOCA was associated with better VCSSs, less frequent
phlebitis, and a shorter time to return to work. The 3year results of an RCT, evaluating the MOCA procedure
vs thermal ablation (EVLA or RFA), were reported by
Vahaaho et al.191 A total of 117 patients were treated,
and the occlusion rate at 3 years was signiﬁcantly lower
with MOCA than with either EVLA or RFA (82% vs
100%; P ¼ .005). A GSV >7 mm in diameter had had an
increased recanalization rate after MOCA.
