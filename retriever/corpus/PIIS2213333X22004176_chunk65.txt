 rates for
the MOCA procedure at 3 years and for UGFS with
physician-compounded foam at 5 years have made
them less durable treatment compared with thermal
ablation. It should be noted, however, that CAC was noninferior to thermal ablation at 5 years in one study.12 Prospective comparative studies with endovenous
microfoam are needed to conﬁrm the long-term clinical
efﬁcacy and a decreased incidence of nerve injury and to
recommend PEM over other ablation techniques.
Guideline 4. IPV ablation in patients with CEAP class
C2 varicose veins
Guideline 4.1.
4.1.1 For patients with varicose veins (CEAP class C2)
who have signiﬁcant, symptomatic axial reﬂux of the
GSV or SSV, we recommend against treatment of
IPVs concomitant with initial ablation of the superﬁcial truncal veins.
Level of recommendation: grade 1 (strong), quality of
evidence: C (low to very low)
4.1.2. For patients with varicose veins (CEAP class C2)
who have signiﬁcant, symptomatic axial reﬂux of the
AAGSV or PAGSV, we suggest against treatment of
IPVs concomitant with initial ablation of the superﬁcial truncal veins.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak), quality of
evidence: C (low to very low)
Rationale. Patients with CEAP class C2 varicose veins
often do not have IPVs identiﬁed by DU, even when
they are present, because many vascular laboratories
have concentrated on imaging the superﬁcial truncal
veins (GSV, SSV, AAGSV, PAGSV) and tributary veins. The
lower extremities have a large number of perforating
veins, and their common locations have been identiﬁed
in elegant anatomic dissections.198,199 When perforating
veins are identiﬁed during the evaluation of varicose
veins, they will often be competent and functioning
normally. However, IPVs can also be identiﬁed in the

thigh and calf when a complete lower extremity venous
study is performed as
