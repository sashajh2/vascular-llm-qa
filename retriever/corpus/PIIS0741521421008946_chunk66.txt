2.7% general; P ¼
.99)
Nonrandomized studies:
Local associated with signiﬁcant reduction in:
Risk of early 30-day perioperative stroke
(38 studies)
Stroke/death (27 studies)
Death (42 studies)
MI (27 studies)
To be noted, methodologic quality of
nonrandomized studies were felt to be
questionable; concluded insufﬁcient evidence from RCT to indicate superiority of
local over general.

Systematic review of
RCTs and
nonrandomized
studies

14 RCTs (4596 procedures)
Vaniyapong
et al, 2013236
(Cochrane Database)

No statistically difference in:
30-day stroke rate (3.2% local vs 3.5%
general)
30-day stroke/death (3.6% local vs 4.2%
general)
Concluded stroke/death rates were
similar

Retrospective analysis of VQI Database
2003-2017 (75,319 procures)

Compared real-world outcome of CEA
under local vs general.
No difference in perioperative death/
stroke.
CEA with general was associated with:
4 times the odds of acute CHF (OR, 3.92,
95% CI, 1.84-8.34; P < .001)
1.5 times the odds of hemodynamic
instability (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.44-1.66; P <
.001)
Noted differences were clinically irrelevant, as overall risk of cardiac adverse
events were low.
Approach to choosing anesthesia should
be based on patient risk factors, preference and team experience.
