elines are directed toward AV access surgeons and
specialists (such as interventional radiologists, nephrologists, and cardiologists) as the providers whose ultimate
operative decision determines the type of access placed.
The panel’s recommendations have culminated in the following practice guidelines: optimal timing and indications
for referral of patients with advanced CKD, defined by a
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) of ⬎20 to 25 mL/min, to a vascular
access surgeon, preoperative evaluation for AV access, configuration and strategies to optimize autogenous AV access
placement, assessment of functionality of AV access, and
treatment of AV access thrombosis.
To help the panel formulate its recommendations, the
SVS used the help of The Knowledge and Encounter
Research Unit (KER) of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota. This independent group performed a systematic study of the available evidence in three
main areas provided by the panel: timing of referral to
access surgeons, type of access placed, and effectiveness of
surveillance.13-15 The panel adopted the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) scheme to formulate these recommendations
because this system separates the strength of recommendations from the quality of the evidence.16 This separation
informs guideline users (eg, patients, clinicians, and policy
makers) of factors other than evidence, such as values and
preferences if applicable, and clinical and social circumstances that played a role in formulating these recommendations.
These systematic literature reviews revealed a paucity of
high-quality evidence in this area, and many of the recommendations herein are based on observational studies, unsystematic observations, and consensus of our committee.
Nevertheless, some of these recommendations were graded
as strong (GRADE 1) because of the values and preferences
brought to bear by the committee and are explicitly described in this article. In addition, because of the multidisciplinary nature of the committee, these recommendations
reflect consensus among access surgeons and nephrologists. Although by spearheading this project the SVS aimed
to provide a structure to form the underpinning of patient
evaluation and decision making by the access surgeon, it is
important to emphasize that these recommendations are
not intended to supersede the surgeon’s final judgment
regarding the management of the individual patient.
