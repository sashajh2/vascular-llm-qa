 evidence exists, compression
may decrease long-term costs associated with CVI. In a
Markov decision analysis, use of compression was associated with an estimated savings of $17,000 during a patient’s lifetime.512 However, this study used a
hypothetical patient with C5 disease and did not directly
assess lower clinical classes of venous reﬂux. Regardless,
this study provides support for use of compression in those
at risk for VLU without signiﬁcant downside to use of
compression.
Guideline 8.2: Primary PreventiondClinical CEAP
C1-4 Post-thrombotic Venous Disease
In patients with clinical CEAP C1-4 disease related
to prior deep venous thrombosis (DVT), we recommend compression, 30 to 40 mm Hg, knee or thigh
high. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Venous reﬂux related to PTS typically is associated with
more severe symptoms than is primary valvular reﬂux, progresses to a more severe CEAP class, and may confer
increased risk for VLU.513,514 Venous occlusion does increase the risk of severe CVI, as the thrombus becomes a
thick and collagen-dense occlusive lesion.503 Combined
deep and superﬁcial disease is likely after DVT and is associated with higher CEAP class.515 The entire vein wall is
often damaged by the thrombotic process, even with recanalization, as demonstrated by duplex ultrasound. Whether
a segment of the deep vein system remains occluded or is
recanalized, normal venous function is lost. After recanalization, the valves are incompetent, with signiﬁcant
reﬂux.516
Given the more aggressive long-term course of PTS,
we recommend 30 to 40 mm Hg compression hose, either
knee or thigh high. Two large RCTs support the use of
compression to decrease the occurrence of PTS.197,517,518
Overall, a reduction of w50% was observed. Lesser
compression strength, such as 20 to 30 mm Hg, is not as
effective.519 Multilayer compression is effective only for
symptoms and
