. Three
segments are usually treated. Proebstle and Herdemann359
also treat the perforating veins at three locations, each
segment receiving between 60 and 100 J. The rest of the
procedure is similar to RFA.
Sclerotherapy. For chemical ablation of perforating
veins, a 25-, 27-, or 30-gauge needle can be used for
cannulation. If the anatomy allows, a wire may be placed
into the deep system for better control of the access.
Ultrasonographically guided sclerotherapy has been reported using morrhuate sodium,351 although most experts
recommend STS or polidocanol foam. Care should be
taken to avoid injection of the agent into the accompanying
artery. During injection of 0.5 to 1 mL of the sclerosant,
the patient’s leg is elevated to avoid flow into the deep
system. After treatment, compression is applied over the
treated perforators.357
Complications. SEPS is safe and complications are
rare. Death or PE has not been reported, and the North
American SEPS registry had no patient with DVT ⱕ30 days
of the procedure. Wound infection and saphenous neuralgia occurred in 6% each. In an RCT, Pierik et al360 observed
a significantly higher rate of wound complications after
open perforator ligation, using a modified Linton procedure, than after endoscopic perforator ligation (53% vs 0%;
P ⬍ .001).
Complications after PAPS are rare, and in a review of
published series, O’Donnell356 found evidence of tibial
vein DVT in three series and foot drop and skin burn in one
each. Masuda et al351 treated 80 limbs with sclerotherapy of
the perforating veins. There were no cases of DVT involving the deep vein adjacent to the perforator injected. One
patient had skin complications with skin necrosis.
Results of perforator ablation
Subfascial endoscopic perforator vein surgery. Most
series of SEPS were performed in patients with advanced
disease (class C3-C6, mostly C5 and C6), and perforator
int
