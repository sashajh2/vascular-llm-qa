response to injury, such as cigarette smoking.173,174
Several genome-wide association studies have also
been conducted for various cardiovascular diseases,175
at least three of which have focused on AAA.176 A number of genetic loci have been implicated in AAA pathogenesis (Table V).172 The noncoding region of
chromosome 9p21 has been identiﬁed as an important
source of heritable risk for coronary and peripheral arterial disease as well as for AAA, independent of smoking,
hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The at-risk allele may
mediate this effect by downregulating the cell cycle regulatory gene CDKN2B.177 Epigenetic regulation of gene
expression through microRNA production and posttranslation regulation of gene expression may also inﬂuence inﬂammation, ﬁbrosis, or other mechanisms relevant to AAA pathogenesis.178,179
Some monogenic diseases increase the risk of AAA,
including mutations within the COL3AI gene, associated
with an autosomal dominant defect in type III collagen
synthesis present in patients with the Ehlers-Danlos
phenotype180,181 or mutations in ﬁbrillin 1, responsible
for Marfan syndrome.182 In Ehlers-Danlos and Marfan syndromes, isolated AAA is uncommon in the absence of
other arterial aneurysms or aortic dissection, respectively.
Aneurysm imaging
Modalities for aneurysm imaging. Among asymptomatic patients, ultrasound detects the presence of an AAA
accurately, reproducibly, and efﬁciently. Sensitivity and
speciﬁcity approach 100%, but in 1% to 3% of patients,
the aorta cannot be visualized because of bowel gas or
obesity.183,184 Transabdominal ultrasound is ideal for
screening and surveillance185 but insufﬁciently precise for
procedural planning or more complex morphologic analyses.186-188
CT imaging is more reproducible than ultrasound, with
>90% of measurements within 2 mm of the initial
reading.189 Both techniques suffer from a lack of standardization in terms of determining the degree and
rate of disease progression.1
