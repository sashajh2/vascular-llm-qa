common in the foam group than in the open surgery
group (P < .001). At 6 weeks, patients who had undergone surgery had had lower SF-36 (short-form 36-item)
scores, indicating worse generic QoL than that of those
who had undergone laser treatment. The differences
were signiﬁcant for bodily pain, vitality, and role limitations due to emotional and physical health. These differences between groups were no longer present at
6 months.99 In the systematic review, no difference was
found in the disease-speciﬁc QoL scores when high
ligation and saphenous stripping was compared with
RFA at 1 month.19,114,131
In the EVOLVeS (evaluation of cinacalcet hydrochloride
therapy to lower cardiovascular events) RCT, the time to
return to normal activities was signiﬁcantly better after
RFA than after high ligation and saphenous stripping
(mean, 1.15 days vs 3.89 days; P ¼.02). In the RFA group,
80.5% of the patients had returned to their routine activities of daily living within 1 day compared with 46.9% of
the patients in the high ligation and saphenous stripping
group (P < .01).113 In a recent RCT that had compared
high ligation and saphenous stripping with CAC ablation
of the GSV in 126 patients, the closure rate was 100% in
both groups at 3 months. However, the postoperative
pain and ecchymosis grades were signiﬁcantly lower in
the CAC group.217
Both open surgical stripping and the currently available
endovenous procedures are durable procedures. The 5year results from the CLASS study conﬁrmed the equally
improved disease-speciﬁc QoL in both the surgery and
the laser groups and both were superior to the results after physician-compounded foam.10 Using a probabilistic
cost-effectiveness model iteration, their results favored
laser ab
