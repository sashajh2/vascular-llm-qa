Best Practice Statement

Rationale
The Writing Committee decided to not write their own
guidelines on pharmacological interventions in people
with diabetes, PAD, and a foot ulcer or gangrene in order
to reduce cardiovascular risk or to prevent major limb
events as deﬁned above. There are already a number of
guidelines on cardiovascular risk prevention in people
with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and thus
another guideline would have little added value. It was
decided to base the Best Practice Statements on the
GVG for CLTI produced by the ESVS, SVS, and World
Federation of Vascular Societies (WFVS),20 as these
address the speciﬁc population of people with CLTI.
However, it was also felt that some of the recommendations of the CLTI guidelines should be adapted to the
speciﬁc population of people with diabetes. When it
was felt applicable, the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the European Association for
the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and other guidelines on peripheral artery disease (European Society of Cardiology
[ESC]-ESVS, European Society of Vascular Medicine
[ESVM], and ESC-EASD, ESC- European Atherosclerosis
Society [EAS]) were used.16e19,22,23,129
PAD runs a more aggressive course in those with diabetes mellitus compared with those without diabetes,
with an elevated risk of lower leg amputation. In addition, the combination of diabetes and PAD is associated
with a high risk of developing complications in other
vascular beds. As discussed previously, persons with an
ischaemic diabetes related foot ulcer have an overall
ﬁve year cardiovascular mortality of around 50%.130
Therefore, according to the international guidelines of
several major vascular and diabetes associations, these
individuals should be considered as having a very high
cardiovascular risk and should be treated as such. On
the other hand, they usually have, in addition to peripheral neuropathy, other diabetes related complications
as well as several co-morbidities, resulting in a high

burden of diseases and multiple medications.30 Many
affected persons are elderly, frail, and are living in vulnerable socio-economic circumstances with a low quality of
