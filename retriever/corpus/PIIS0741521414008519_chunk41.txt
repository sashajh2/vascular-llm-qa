 pathways
that perpetuate inﬂammation.46-48
The pathophysiologic process of primary venous
disease is a complex entity with multifaceted stages
leading to the dilated tortuous, valve-insufﬁcient varicose veins, venous hypertension, and the associated
clinical manifestations seen with CVD. The pathophysiologic mechanism of secondary venous disease involves
inﬂammation, thrombosis, recanalization resulting in
venous wall damage and dilation, and valve insufﬁciency. The clinical picture is that of the postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) and can comprise pain,
