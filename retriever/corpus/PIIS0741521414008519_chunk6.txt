We suggest selective use of venous plethysmography in the evaluation of patients with suspected venous leg
ulcer if venous duplex ultrasound does not provide deﬁnitive diagnostic information. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 3.11: Venous Imaging
We suggest selective computed tomography venography, magnetic resonance venography, contrast venography,
and/or intravascular ultrasound in patients with suspected venous leg ulceration if additional advanced venous
diagnosis is required for thrombotic or nonthrombotic iliac vein obstruction or for operative planning before
open or endovenous interventions. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 3.12: Venous Disease Classiﬁcation
We recommend that all patients with venous leg ulcer be classiﬁed on the basis of venous disease classiﬁcation
assessment, including clinical CEAP, revised Venous Clinical Severity Score, and venous diseaseespeciﬁc quality of
life assessment. [BEST PRACTICE]
Guideline 3.13: Venous Procedural Outcome Assessment
We recommend venous procedural outcome assessment including reporting of anatomic success, venous hemodynamic success, procedure-related minor and major complications, and impact on venous leg ulcer healing. [BEST
PRACTICE]
WOUND CARE
Guideline 4.1: Wound Cleansers
We suggest that venous leg ulcers be cleansed initially and at each dressing change with a neutral, nonirritating,
nontoxic solution, performed with a minimum of chemical or mechanical trauma. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE - C]

Guideline 4.2: Débridement
We recommend that venous leg ulcers receive thorough débridement at their initial evaluation to remove obvious
necrotic tissue, excessive bacterial burden, and cellular burden of dead and senescent cells. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE - B] We suggest that additional maintenance débridement be performed to maintain the appearance
and readiness of the wound bed for healing. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B] We suggest that the health
