 compression stockings, and
topical, intramuscular, or intravenous treatment as well
as surgical thrombectomy or ligation. A minority of
studies compared treatment to placebo and most
studies were small and of poor quality. Further, most
studies excluded patients with SVT that was within 3 cm
of the SFJ. The recommendations are primarily based on
one large placebo controlled RCT of 3002 participants
who received fondaparinux and demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduction in symptomatic VTE, SVT extension, and
SVT recurrence in comparison with placebo. Major

bleeding was infrequent in both groups. A second systematic review and meta-analysis included seventeen
studies and 6862 patients with SVT and conﬁrmed that
fondaparinux achieved the lowest rate of progression to
DVT and PE without conclusions about other treatment
due to low quality evidence.35 In the Surprise study, patients with SVT and one or more risk factors for VTE were
randomized to 45 days of fondaparinux or rivaroxaban
10 mg.257 The results suggested that rivaroxaban was as
effective as fondaparinux, however, the study was not
powered to prove noninferiority. A call for further studies
was prompted by the nonsigniﬁcant increase in the primary composite outcome as well as by an increase in
clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in the rivaroxaban
group. These recommendations are similar to those,
published recently on management of SVT in the CHEST
guidelines.253
Low-quality evidence in one study found that prophylactic LMWH reduced extension of SVT (statistically signiﬁcant), but did not reduce incidence of VTE, while
therapeutic LMWH evaluated in one study reduced
both SVT extension (statistically signiﬁcant) and progression to VTE, but improvement was less signiﬁcant at
3 month follow-up due to a catch-up phenomenon.34
NSAIDS were also found in one study to reduce SVT
extension (statistically signiﬁcant).258 However, there
