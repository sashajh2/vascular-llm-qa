not identiﬁed. Incidence of these events is very low
(approximately 1.5%). However, risk of progression/
embolization in these patients is unclear.

Probably
low

Do the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable
effects?

Yes

Yes

What is the overall certainty of the evidence of effects?

High certainty regarding low incidence of thrombotic
events after ablation. Low certainty regarding the natural
history of rare asymptomatic events identiﬁed by
ultrasound.

How large are the resource requirements associated
with the intervention?

Very high

Very high

How large is the incremental cost relative to the net
beneﬁt?

Very high

Very high

What would be the effect on health inequalities?

None

None

Is the opinion acceptable to key stakeholders?

No data available

Probably
yes

Is the opinion feasible to implement?

Yes (resource saving)

Yes

randomized trials including patients undergoing thermal ablation of the GSV and having ultrasound surveillance within 1 month of the procedure.235 The pooled
incidence of EHIT II to IV or DVT was 1.7% (95% CI,
0.9%-2.7%), for EHIT II toe IV 1.4 % (0.8%-2.3%), for DVT
0.3% (0.2%-0.5%), and for PE 0.1% (0.1%-0.02%). Signiﬁcant heterogeneity was noted for EHIT II to IV þ PE and
EHIT II to IV, but not for DVT or PE.

A third systematic review including 75 studies (23,265
patients) included both RCTs and case series and found
very similar incidences of EHIT II to IV (1.27%; 95% CI, 0.741.93%), DVT (0.28%; 95% CI, 0.18-0.4%), and PE (0.11%; 95%
CI, 0.06-0.18%).236 Other systematic reviews have found
the majority of DVTs to be conﬁned to the calf veins,
with the incidence of proximal DVT varying between
0% and 0.4%.41
