itant interventions (eg, phlebectomy, sclerotherapy), and
publication timeline (ie, before and after 2016) for thermal
techniques. We also conducted sensitivity analyses in
which we excluded high risk of bias studies. We were
unable to evaluate clinical class of venous disease (CEAP
classiﬁcation-200423 vs CEAP classiﬁcation-202016) owing
to lack of comparative data.

We included 73 studies (in 94 publications) and one
systematic review (Key Question 1: 2 studies24,25; Key Question 2: 26 RCTs [in 35 publications]26-60 and 13 comparative
observational studies61-73; Key Question 3: 12 RCTs [in 18
publications]74-91 and 8 comparative observational
studies92-99; Key Question 2 and 3: 4 RCTs [in 9
publications]100-108 and 3 comparative observational
studies109-111; Key Question 4: 2 RCTs.112,113 To address the
effect of concomitant treatment with phlebectomy or
sclerotherapy, we included 1 RCT (in 2 publications),114,115
2 comparative observational studies,116,117 and 1
systematic review (8 studies in 2147 patients).118
The included studies compared variant forms of the
available diagnostic and treatment modalities for lower
extremities varicose veins and enrolled 16,896 patients,
