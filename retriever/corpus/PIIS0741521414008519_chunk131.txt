Guideline 8.3: Primary PreventiondAcute DVT
Treatment
As post-thrombotic syndrome is a common preceding event for venous leg ulcers, we recommend current
evidence-based therapies for acute DVT treatment.
[GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B] We suggest
use of low-molecular-weight heparin over vitamin K
antagonist therapy of 3-month duration to decrease
post-thrombotic syndrome. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE - B] We suggest catheter-directed thrombolysis in patients with low bleeding risk with iliofemoral DVT of duration <14 days. [GRADE - 2;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
The goal of DVT treatment is twofold: ﬁrst, to prevent venous embolization to the pulmonary circulation
from the thrombus; and second, to prevent propagation
and recurrence of DVT, a direct factor for PTS. Venous
stasis ulceration is the end-stage manifestation of PTS
and is disabling and even limb-threatening.528 PTS treatment is primarily palliative, and thus prevention of DVT
is paramount. There are numerous risk factors for PTS
development,529 and recurrent DVT in the same segment
of a prior DVT contributes most signiﬁcantly to this
process.530
Current well-established evidence-based guidelines
are available from the 2012 American College of Chest
Physicians guidelines.522 Referral to this document for
details and references, as the evidence-based recommendations are thorough, is recommended. There are several
salient points for the treatment of acute DVT to summarize. First, rapid parenteral anticoagulation with either
low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux is indicated
over intravenous unfractionated heparin (Grade 1A), as this
may increase DVT recanalization.531 Second, early use of
compression is recommended, generally within 24 hours
of diagnosis (Grade 2C). Third, early ambulation and
limiting of bed rest are recommended.532 Fourth,

transition from a parenteral agent to vitamin K antagonist
with at least 3-month treatment is the minimum duration.
