Placebo, different

liquid, foam, different
sclerosing solutions,

Systematic
Very low-certainty evidence
that sclerotherapy is effective review with 28
RCTs
and safe compared with
placebo. Limited to no
evidence for one
concentration of foam to
another; foam compared with
liquid; foam compared with
any other substance; or one
technique to another.
