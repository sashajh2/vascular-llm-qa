 veins
(C2-C4)
randomized
(intention to
treat)

EVLA (n ¼ 34);
RFA (n ¼ 33);
3-year followup, 31 and 25

MOCA (n ¼ 65);
3-year followup, 50)

At 3 years, closure rate
signiﬁcantly lower for
MOCA than EVLA or
RFA (82% vs 100%; P <
.005)

RCT

Lane et al,175

170 Patients with
varicose veins
(GSV or SSV)

RFA (n ¼ 83)

MOCA (n ¼ 87)

Intraprocedural pain
(maximum and
average pain scores
signiﬁcantly less after
MOCA; P < .003); no
difference between
groups in return to
work or normal
activities; at 1 and
6 months, no
difference in QoL
between groups

Multicenter RCT

Mohamed
et al,95 2021

150 Patients with
varicose veins
(C2-C6)

EVLA (n ¼ 75)

MOCA (n ¼ 75)

Similar intraprocedural
pain scores (P ¼ .021);
at 1 year, occlusion rate
after EVLA was 91%
(63/69) vs 77% (53/69)
after MOCA (P ¼ .020);
at 1 year, both groups
had similar, signiﬁcant
improvement in VCSS
and AVVQ

RCT

Lawaetz et al,7
2017

500 Patients (580
limbs) with
varicose veins
(GSV)

EVLA (n ¼ 125);
RFA (n ¼ 125);
HL&S
(n ¼ 125)

UGFS, with
physiciancompounded
foam (3%
polidocanol);
n ¼ 125)

At 5 years, all treatment
modalities were
efﬁcacious and
resulted in similar
improvement in
