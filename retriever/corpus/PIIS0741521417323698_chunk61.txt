 macrophage localization,236 and proteolysis,237
is being translated to the clinic238-241 and may help identify those patients with an increased likelihood of disease
progression.
Gender-speciﬁc rupture indicators have been evaluated, given the increased risk for rupture in women at
any given aortic diameter. A recent computational study
of patient-speciﬁc anatomy using ﬁnite element analysis
was unable to identify signiﬁcant differences in peak wall
stress and peak wall rupture indices between men and
women.242 Although aneurysm diameter remains a
well-established parameter for clinical decision-making,
a retrospective analysis has suggested that aneurysm
diameter indexed to body size (aortic size index ¼ aneurysm diameter [cm]/body surface area [m2]) may represent a superior predictor of rupture risk for women.243
Recommendations for aneurysm screening. Aneurysm screening has been motivated by a desire to reduce
AAA-related mortality and to prolong life expectancy.
Overall, the probability of AAA in the general population
is low but signiﬁcantly increased when certain risk factors

are present.33 Four randomized clinical trials that
included 127,891 men and 9342 women between 65 and
79 years of age provided evidence that ultrasound
screening is effective in reducing aneurysm-related
mortality.244-249 This beneﬁt begins within 3 years of
testing and persists for up to 15 years.250 In addition,
screening is associated with a reduced risk for AAA
rupture and emergency surgery.250
The Multicenter Aneurysm Screening Study (MASS)
group, the largest of the four randomized clinical trials,
reported that during 13 years, there was a 42% reduction
in AAA-related mortality and a small reduction in allcause mortality. It was estimated that 216 men needed
to be invited to screening to save one death during 13
years. Of those aneurysms that did rupture, roughly half
had an initial baseline diameter of 2.5 to 2.9 cm at initial
screening.251
Screening for AAA in women is more controversial.
Because few women were
