 the GSV results in
good outcome in symptomatic patients, who have
competent SFJ but incompetent distal thigh or upper
calf GSV.
In contrast, segmental or complete ablation of the GSV
is rarely indicated for isolated reﬂuxing segments with
competent segments proximally and distally (Table XII).
The GSV has an average of 6.7 valves (range, 3-11 valves).149
Isolated segmental reﬂux may be identiﬁed by ultrasound even in the presence of a competent GSV. Such
a phenomenon may occur in a segment between two
competent valves when inﬂow occurs from a competent
tributary and outﬂow from an incompetent tributary or a
competent perforator between the two valves.150 When
symptomatic, such incompetent tributaries can be
managed with phlebectomy.
5.2.5. In patients with reﬂux in the below-knee GSV,
ablation to the lowest point of reﬂux resulted in better
