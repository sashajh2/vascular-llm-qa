Table V. Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) reclassiﬁcation after debridement and control of infection (if
required)
The complete WIfI system is used to classify the patient at the time of initial presentation. In some patients with severe infection, the patient
might require urgent drainage and debridement prior to objective documentation of foot perfusion. In such cases, the initial ischemia
status would be listed as U (Unknown). The ischemia grade would be added after drainage of infection. If ischemia was detected and
measured, but urgent drainage of infection was nonetheless required, the patient must be reclassiﬁed after control of infection prior to
revascularization. This process could be simpliﬁed as follows:
Group a: No infection within 30 days or simple infection controlled with antibiotics alone
Group b: Infection controlled, but required incision and drainage, open toe or partial forefoot amputation

W0 I3 (Wound 0, Ischemia 3) patients ¼ rest pain, no tissue loss; most such patients would beneﬁt from revascularization.

W0 I1, 2 ¼ have no wound, no rest pain, and do not require revascularization
The remaining 11 possible patient scenarios may require revascularization.
Some of W2 and W3 patients with I “0” may have regional perfusion abnormalities (eg, heel ulcer in patient with CKD and normal toe
pressure, but arch incomplete and heel ischemic).
Examples:
1. Patient Alpha presents with a noninfected, full-thickness, dorsal foot wound with exposed tendon and an ABI of 0.45 with a TP of
38 mm Hg.
Initial WIfI ¼ W2 I2 fI 0
The patient does not respond to simple wound care, so a revascularization is planned.
