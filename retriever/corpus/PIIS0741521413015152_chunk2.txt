whose major threat to limb was chronic ischemia. CLI was
deﬁned as an ankle pressure (AP) <40 mm Hg in the presence of rest pain and <60 mm Hg in the presence of tissue
necrosis. Toward the end of this brief document, the authors
emphasized: “It was generally agreed that diabetic patients
who have a varied clinical picture of neuropathy, ischemia
and sepsis make deﬁnition even more difﬁcult and it is desirable that these patients be excluded.or should be clearly
deﬁned as a separate category to allow the analysis of the
results in the nondiabetic patients.”1 Over the last 40 years,
the use of the term CLI has been widely and inappropriately
applied to a much broader spectrum of patients than originally intended. In part because of this overly liberal application of the term CLI, efforts to measure and compare
outcomes of different treatment options have been problematic, especially as revascularization options and other
treatment approaches have rapidly expanded.
For a disease staging system to be clinically relevant, it
must achieve two primary goals: (1) accurately provide risk
stratiﬁcation of patients with respect to disease natural
history, and (2) accurately stratify patients with sufﬁcient
granularity to allow meaningful comparison of different

treatment strategies. Because it must be descriptive and
predictive, a key guiding principle in developing an
improved classiﬁcation of chronic ischemia and the threatened limb is that disease stages should correlate with their
natural history or risk of major amputation if treated
conservatively. It is our
