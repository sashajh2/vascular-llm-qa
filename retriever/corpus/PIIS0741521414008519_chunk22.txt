Epidemiology of Venous Leg Ulcers. VLUs are the
most common ulceration on the lower extremity and account for 70% of all leg ulcers.4 Various estimates have
been made from observational studies on the prevalence of
VLU, ranging between 0.06% and 2%. The Edinburgh
study, which was a cross-sectional study of a random
sample of more than 1500 people between the ages of 18
and 64 years, provided an estimate of VLU prevalence of
1%.5 This lower prevalence contrasts with the higher
prevalence of an earlier study (2.7% clinical CEAP C5/
C6), which was based on a questionnaire and photographs
of the legs of the participants.6 As in the Edinburgh study,
VLU prevalence increased with age. Two other studies
examined large populations. Approximately 40,000 Polish
patients underwent clinical evaluation and interviews by a
variety of health care professionals in a multicenter study
showing a 1.5% prevalence of C5/C6 disease.7 Another
cross-sectional study carried out in France addressed a
subset of patients from a larger study of Raynaud patients.
All of the 400 patients were evaluated by vascular medicine
specialists. C5 disease was higher in men (5.4%) than in
women (2.7%), but the investigators observed no open
ulcers.8 The most detailed information comes from the
Bonn Vein Longitudinal Study initiated by the German
Ministry of Health.9 More than 3000 participants were
randomly identiﬁed between the ages of 18 and 79 years.
Advanced chronic venous reﬂux (chronic venous insufﬁciency [CVI]) was found in 0.6% with a healed VLU (C5)
and in 0.1% with an open VLU for a total of 0.7%. This
longitudinal study documented a decrease in advanced
CVI (C4-C6), which may be related to a more comprehensive use of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for
CVI. Because of the high prevalence of venous disease, the
AVF National Venous Screening Program was established
in the United States to increase awareness. The program
