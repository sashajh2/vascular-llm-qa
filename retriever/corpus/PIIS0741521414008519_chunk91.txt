 encompassing 200 participants, with 54% of patients healed in the 4LB group
compared with 34% in the control group (P < .001).286
Another RCT of 233 patients failed to ﬁnd a difference between two groups with regard to complete healing at 1
year but did ﬁnd improved rate of healing (median time
of 20 vs 43 weeks; P ¼ .03) favoring the compression
group.287

Guideline 5.2: CompressiondUlcer Recurrence
In a patient with a healed venous leg ulcer, we suggest compression therapy to decrease the risk of ulcer
recurrence. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
The potential for recurrence of VLUs is high as
demonstrated by a 67% recurrence rate in one study, in
which 35% of patients exhibited a remarkable four or
more episodes of ulceration.140 The reported recurrence
rate for ulcers in one study in the setting of compression
therapy alone is 28% and in combination with superﬁcial
venous surgery is 12%, highlighting the recent improvements in clinical practice.288
As more success is achieved with healing of primary
VLUs, the number of patients at risk for recurrence
rises.289 However, few RCTs have speciﬁcally evaluated
the impact of compression therapy on the risk of ulcer
recurrence. One trial randomized 153 patients with
recently healed (2 weeks) VLU to compression or no
compression therapy. Compression hosiery with a high
pressure (34-46 mm Hg) was associated with signiﬁcant
reduction in ulcer recurrence at 6 months compared with
no compression (21% vs 46%; RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.270.76; P ¼ .003).289,290 A second RCT of 188 patients randomized 166 into two treatment groups, each receiving
therapy with 23 mm Hg compression at the ankle with
two brands of stockings. Compliance data reported from
this trial as summarized in Nelson and Bell-S
