 tibial and deep
femoral veins of >500 ms should be adopted as standard for the degree of reﬂux. A similar 500-ms value
was also proposed and accepted as the minimum
value for patients with incompetence of other superﬁcial truncal veins, including the AAGSV.57 A minimum
value for signiﬁcant reﬂux in the femoral and popliteal
veins of 1 second has also been deﬁned in multiple
previous guidelines and consensus documents,20,27,38,39
and our writing committee has also accepted it as a
best practice statement.
1.1.b. Axial reﬂux is deﬁned as uninterrupted retrograde venous ﬂow from the groin to the calf. Retrograde ﬂow can be in the superﬁcial or deep veins,
with or without perforating veins. Junctional reﬂux
will be limited to the SFJ or SPJ. Segmental reﬂux occurs in a portion of a superﬁcial or deep truncal vein.
To deﬁne axial, junctional, and segmental reﬂux, we
adopted the terminology deﬁned in the updates of the
CEAP classiﬁcation,15,31 the Vein Glossary,32 and the
VEIN-TERM document33 (Supplementary Table I, online
only). “Complete axial reﬂux in a symptomatic patient is
pathognomonic, but junctional reﬂux alone is an indication for ablation. Conversely, a competent junction may
be associated with an incompetent, pathologic GSV
distal to the terminal valve and the source of varicosity
in such patients can be either pelvic vein incompetence
or an incompetent thigh perforating vein.”
1.1.c. A deﬁnition of “pathologic” perforating veins in
patients with varicose veins (CEAP clinical class C2) includes those with an outward ﬂow duration of
$500 ms and a diameter of $3.5 mm on DU.
For patients with CVD (CEAP class C2-C6), the minimal
values suggested for clinically signiﬁcant incompetent
perforating veins (IPVs) were 350 ms and 500 ms.56,58,
