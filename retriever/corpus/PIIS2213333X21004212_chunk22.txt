 Rasmussen et al104 as four
stripping procedures that failed because the stripper
perforated the GSV, and the vein could not be accessed
from below. In the series reported by Venermo et al,108
failure was owing to partial occlusion of GSV.
Pigmentation. HL/S was associated with a lower risk of
pigmentation than EVLA (RR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.13-0.54;
I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies49,100).
Quality of life. No statistically signiﬁcant association
was found in the disease speciﬁc QoL score when HL/S
was compared with RFA (SMD, 0.19; 95% CI, e0.62 to 1;
I2 ¼ 93.7%; 3 studies38,40,109).
Recurrent incompetence. HL/S was signiﬁcantly associated with an increased risk of recurrent incompetence
compared with RFA, while UGFS was associated with a
higher risk compared with surgery (RR,7.84; 95% CI, 1.8134.01; I2 ¼ 0.00%, 3 studies33,67,105) and (RR, 0.62; 95% CI,
0.41-0.94; I2 ¼ 19.60%, 2 studies56,105), respectively. No
statistically signiﬁcant association was found for recurrent incompetence when HL/S was compared with EVLA
(RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.26-5.47; I2 ¼ 78.2%; 4 studies27,47,49,105).
Additionally, compared with HL/S, EVLA was associated
with a higher patient satisfaction scores (SMD, e0.63;
95% CI, e0.87 to e0.38; I2 ¼ 56.7%; 1 study28). Compared
with UGFS, HL/S was associated with signiﬁ
