The CHIVA technique. The CHIVA technique is a
hemodynamic approach to varicose veins based on the
principles of preserving the saphenous vein and venous
drainage into the deep system.186,190 The goal of CHIVA

is to decrease the hydrostatic pressure in the saphenous
veins and tributaries by the ligations placed in specific areas
in the superficial venous system and to maintain the drainage function of the superficial veins, usually via a reversed
flow.186 It represents a systematic approach to varicose
veins rather than a single operative procedure.
Several anatomic patterns of reflux have been identified, each requiring a somewhat different operative strategy
based on the underlying anatomy, studied in utmost detail
with duplex scanning.188 A frequently used CHIVA technique presented in an RCT included proximal ligation of
the incompetent saphenous vein; ligation, division, and
avulsion of the incompetent varicose tributaries; and maintaining patency of the saphenous trunk, the competent
saphenous tributaries, and saphenous venous drainage to
the deep system through the so-called reentry perforators.191 A recently published RCT presented further details
of the technique in six different types of varicosity.192
The ASVAL technique. Described by Pittaluga et
al,126 the ASVAL operation includes preservation of the
incompetent saphenous vein and stab phlebectomy of all
varicose tributaries. Most patients operated on with this
technique in one study had a less advanced stage of varicosity (CEAP class C2) and presented with no symptoms in
33% and no trophic skin changes in 91%.126
Perioperative thrombosis prophylaxis. Selective
prophylaxis after risk assessment is warranted in patients
who undergo venous surgery. The risk of DVT is increased
in patients with thrombophilia, in those with a history of
DVT or thrombophlebitis, and in
