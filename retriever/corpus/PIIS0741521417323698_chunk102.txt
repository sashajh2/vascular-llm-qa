 celiac
and SMA occlusive disease, particularly in the presence
of a large meandering artery. The IMA can be easily
controlled before opening the aneurysm by a vessel
loop and reimplantation to an aortic graft performed
using a Carrel patch technique, in which a small button
of aortic wall is dissected free from adherent thrombus
and calciﬁc debris. In the Canadian aneurysm trial, IMA
reimplantation was used in 5% of the patients but
was associated with increased risk of postoperative
bleeding.419 Preservation of antegrade ﬂow into at least
one of the internal iliac arteries is recommended whenever possible. For patients treated by OSR, this can
usually be achieved by a distal anastomosis to the iliac
bifurcation, an end-to-side-anastomosis at the external
iliac artery with retrograde ﬂow into the internal iliac
artery, or a separate bypass graft to the internal iliac artery.

We recommend reimplantation of a patent IMA under
circumstances that suggest an increased risk of colonic
ischemia.

We recommend that all portions of an aortic graft be
excluded from direct contact with the intestinal contents of
the peritoneal cavity.

Maintenance of pelvic circulation. Perfusion of the
colon, rectum, and pelvis is provided by a complex collateral network from the SMA and IMA through the marginal
artery of Drummond, the internal iliac arteries, and additional collaterals from the circumﬂex iliac and common
and deep femoral arteries. Inadequate pelvic circulation
can lead to sexual dysfunction as well as hip and buttock
claudication. Less frequently, colon or spinal ischemia may
ensue. For example, in the Canadian aneurysm study, the
risk of colon ischemia increased eightfold (0.3% to 2.6%)
when both internal iliac arteries were occluded compared
with
