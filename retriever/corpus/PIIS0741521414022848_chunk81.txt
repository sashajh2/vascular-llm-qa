. No difference in 30day mortality (OR, 0.92; 95% CI,
0.55-1.51). Higher primary patency
in the surgical treatment arm was
found at 1 (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.374.28), 2 (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.203.45), and 3 (OR, 1.48; 95% CI,
1.12-1.97) years after intervention.
Progression to amputation occurred
more commonly in the endovascular
group at the end of the second (OR,
0.60; 95% CI, 0.42-0.86) and third
(OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.39-0.77) year
of intervention. The bypass group
had higher amputation-free (OR,
1.31; 95% CI, 1.07-1.61) and
overall survival (OR, 1.29; 95% CI,
1.04-1.61) rates at 4 years
