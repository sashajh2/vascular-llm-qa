 and not a quantitative severity scale, scoring
system, or an outcome measure that reﬂects changes over
time. For a table of the updated CEAP classiﬁcation please
see Part I of the Guidelines.8
1.1.2. We recommend the use of the revised Venous
Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) for patients with chronic
venous disorders for grading of clinical severity and for
assessment of post treatment outcome.
Good Practice Statement
Rationale and evidence. The revised VCSS is a physicianderived evaluative instrument that is useful to describe the
severity of chronic venous disorders. VCSS is responsive to
changes over time and is suitable to document response to
treatment. VCSS, together with the CEAP classiﬁcation, has
been widely adopted in North American5,7 and international55-59 venous guidelines. The instrument comprises
nine categories, each graded on a scale of 0 to 3. The categories include pain, varicose veins, edema, pigmentation,
inﬂammation, induration, presence and size of ulcers, and
use of compression therapy (Table I). VCSS has been validated and there is correlation between VCSS, CEAP, the
modiﬁed Chronic Venous Insufﬁciency Questionnaire
(CIVIQ) patient-reported outcome instrument and venous
duplex ﬁndings.60,61 The strongest correlation occurred in
pain (r ¼ 0.55; P < .0001). A good correlation was also found
in the ability of VCSS and the Villalta-Prandoni scale to
detect mild to moderate post-thrombotic CVD (gamma
statistic ¼ 0.71-0.98; P < .05).62
1.2-1.5. Evaluation with duplex ultrasound scanning.
1.2.1. For patients with CVD of the lower extremities, we
recommend duplex ultrasound scanning (DUS) as the
diagnostic test of choice to evaluate for venous reﬂux.
