 severe carotid stenosis)11
and SPACE1 (stent-supported percutaneous angioplasty
of the carotid artery vs endarterectomy),12 examined the
role of CAS vs CEA in neurologically symptomatic patients.
EVA-3S showed statistically inferior 30-day outcomes for
CAS compared with CEA. The 30-day incidence of any
stroke or death was 3.9% after CEA (95% CI, 2.0-7.2) and
9.6% after TF-CAS (95% CI, 6.4-14.0). The RR of any stroke
or death after CAS compared with CEA was 2.5 (95% CI,
1.2-5.1). The 30-day incidence of disabling stroke or death
was 1.5% after CEA (95% CI, 0.5-4.2) and 3.4% after CAS
(95% CI, 1.7-6.7); the RR was 2.2 (95% CI, 0.7-7.2). However,
EVA-3S study was criticized because of the relatively low
level of experience (minimum of 12 CAS cases or 35
supra-aortic trunk cases, of which 5 were CAS procedures)
required in the CAS arm. The SPACE trial was designed to
test the “equivalence” between CEA and CAS for patients
with neurologic symptoms. However, the trial was
stopped after the recruitment of 1200 patients owing to
the futility of proving equivalence between the two treatments. The rate of death or ipsilateral stroke at 30 days
was 6.84% for CAS and 6.34% for CEA in for randomized
patients. However, the study was not powered appropriately and failed to show the noninferiority of CAS
compared with CEA (P < .09).12 More recently, two large
randomized trials comparing CEA and TF-CAS for symptomatic patients were completed. The ICST (international
carotid stenting study trial) enrolled 1713 patients and
