Nasogastric decompression and perioperative nutrition. We recommend optimization of preoperative nutritional status before elective open aneurysm repair if
repair will not be unduly delayed.

Prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis. We recommend thromboprophylaxis that includes intermittent
pneumatic compression and early ambulation for all patients undergoing OSR or EVAR.
Level of recommendation

We suggest thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated or
low-molecular-weight heparin for patients undergoing
aneurysm repair at moderate to high risk for venous
thromboembolism and low risk for bleeding.
