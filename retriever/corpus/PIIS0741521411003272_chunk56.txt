 reduced in the compression with surgery group vs those with compression
alone (12% vs 28%; hazard ratio, ⫺2.76; 95% CI, ⫺1.78 to
⫺4.27; P ⬍ .0001). The difference in ulcer recurrence rates
persisted between the two groups at 4 years.159 A weakness
of the trial was that there was no surgical arm without
compression. This was unfortunate, because there is some
evidence that saphenous vein disconnection improves venous function and heals venous ulcers, even without compression bandaging, if the deep veins are normal.160
A meta-analysis and Cochrane Collaboration review of
42 RCTs by Palfreyman et al42,161 searched for evidence of
effectiveness of dressings applied to venous leg ulcers in
addition to compression. The authors concluded that there
is no evidence that hydrocolloid or other dressings beneath
compression are more effective than compression alone.
On the basis of high-quality clinical evidence, the
Guideline Committee recommends compression therapy
for patients with CVI (class C3-C6), including those with
leg ulcers. Compression therapy is now considered the
primary therapy to aid in healing venous ulcers (GRADE
1B) and the adjuvant therapy to superficial vein ablation to
prevent ulcer recurrence (GRADE 1A).
Open venous surgery
Open surgical treatment of varicose veins with ligation
and stripping of the GSV or SSV, combined with excision
of large varicose veins, has been the standard of care of
varicose vein treatment for more than a century. Invagination stripping was first attempted by Keller162 in 1905,
Charles Mayo in 1906163 used an external stripper to
