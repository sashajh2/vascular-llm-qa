 improvement in both QoL and
severity of clinical disease; although both
strategies are acceptable, concomitant
procedures (CT) were more often chosen by
the patient

Probably not
important
uncertainty or
variability

What is the overall certainty of the evidence
of effects?

e

Low

How large are the resource requirements
associated with the intervention?

One study showed CT procedure time was
signiﬁcantly longer than that for UT alone
(65 minutes vs 45 minutes; P ¼ .002); from
the panel’s practice, patient satisfaction with
CT seemed to outweigh added time
required

Small costs

How large is the incremental cost relative to
the net beneﬁt?

One study suggested nonsigniﬁcance
between CT vs UT in return to work (10 vs
3 days, respectively) and return to normal
activities (8 vs 2 days, respectively); this was
likely a type 2 error because only 50 patients
were randomized; from the practice of the
panel, most patients will not be concerned
with the additional recovery time

Unknown

What would be the effect on health
inequities?

Unknown

Unknown

Is the option acceptable to key stakeholders?

All studies showed either strategy is
acceptable, depending on patient
preference; from the practice of the panel,
more patients will choose CT than UT

Probably yes

Is the option feasible to implement?

All studies showed it is feasible to implement;
from the practice of the panel, the option
would be easy to implement

Probably yes
