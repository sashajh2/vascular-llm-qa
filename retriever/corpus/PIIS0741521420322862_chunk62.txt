 The retrograde bypass
can also be tunneled deep (or around) the left renal artery to optimize the course of the graft with a technique
referred to as the French Bypass.153,154 Alternatively,
Huerta et al155 have described a technique (direct open
retrograde revascularization) in which the bypass is
tunneled directly through the small bowel mesentery.
A pedicle of omentum can be mobilized and used to
cover the retrograde bypass graft to avoid contact with
the bowel.
Aortic endarterectomy may play a role in patients with
a hostile operative ﬁeld from multiple prior procedures,
complex abdominal wall defects, radiation injury, and/or
the presence of bacterial contamination. Mell et al156 reported their experience with 80 patients (endarterectomy, 37; bypass, 29; combined, 14) undergoing
treatment for CMI. They reported excellent results in
terms of survival (1 year, 92.2%; 5 years, 64.5%) and
symptom-free survival (1 year, 89.7%; 5 years, 82.1%)
with endarterectomy for revascularization identiﬁed as
predictor of freedom from recurrent symptoms on their
multivariate analysis (5.2% vs 27.6%; HR, 0.2; 95% CI,
004-0.92; P ¼ .02).
There has been a debate about the number of vessels
to be revascularized at the time of open mesenteric
bypass, similar to the scenario with the endovascular
revascularization. Multiple vessel revascularization affords the theoretical advantage that a greater extent of
the bowel is perfused directly and provides some redundancy if one of the grafts were to fail. However, the longterm outcomes comparing the SMA alone and SMA/celiac bypasses have been equivocal, further underscoring
the importance of the SMA as the deﬁnitive target.7,157

There are reports of patients undergoing revascularization of the IMA96 and branches of the SMA158 for CMI,
although these options should be reserved for select patients who are not candidates for the more standard
options.
Although the guidelines
