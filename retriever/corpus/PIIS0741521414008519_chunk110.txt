uloplasty is an anatomically precise technique that has been modiﬁed over time. Although internal
valvuloplasty provides the longest durability, it is technically
more demanding and highly operator dependent. This technique is subject to higher complication rates than external repairs. Serial case series have demonstrated valve competency
rates of 60% to 70% at 5 to 8 years and similar ulcer-free rates

show that most patients included in these studies had healed
