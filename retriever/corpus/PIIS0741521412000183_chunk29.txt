thrombolysis alone. Major bleeding complications were
7.1% for adjunctive pharmacomechanical thrombolysis vs
8.7% for catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis
alone, which was not significantly different.72
Because no direct comparisons regarding the efficacy of
catheter-directed pharmacologic vs pharmacomechanical
thrombolysis were available at the time of the current
systematic review, the efficacy of these devices in preventing
the postthrombotic syndrome is indirectly inferred from
the data regarding pharmacologic catheter-directed lysis
alone. However, their preferential recommendation over
pharmacologic catheter-directed lysis is based on the potential for greater efficacy and safety.
3.3. We suggest open surgical venous thrombectomy in selected patients who are candidates for anticoagulation but in whom thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated (Grade 2C). Venous thrombectomy is
effective in relieving iliofemoral venous obstruction and
may preserve function of more distal valves. Iliofemoral
venous thrombectomy has been compared with anticoagulation therapy in 10 studies,52,75-83 only one of which was a
prospective, randomized trial.80 All studies were small,
ranging from 15 to 192 patients, with follow-up varying
from 6 months to 10 years. However, pooled analysis19 of
the five studies75-77,80,83 evaluating reflux showed thrombectomy was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of reflux (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.46-0.99).
Among the four studies75,80,82,83 evaluating venous patency, there was a nonsignificant trend toward less ven
