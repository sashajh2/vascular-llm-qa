on the clinical circumstances. Because ﬂow rates through the
long prosthetic axillofemoral graft limb are higher with bilateral grafts, the bifemoral conﬁguration is generally preferred.
The proximal anastomosis should be made to the second
portion of the axillary artery, exposed by division or retraction of the pectoralis major muscle. Externally supported
prosthetic conduits (Dacron or ePTFE) are used to resist
compression along the chest wall. The tunnel should be
placed anterior to the anterior-superior iliac spine and below
the pectoralis major muscle, along the anterior axillary line. A
variety of conﬁgurations have been used for the crossfemoral limb and distal anastomoses, without apparent inﬂuence on the outcome. The inverted “U” conﬁguration, as
used in FFB, is most commonly used.

As in all reconstructions for AIOD, careful attention is
paid to the status of the CFA/DFA, and adjunctive endarterectomy or patch angioplasty are performed as needed.
Operative mortality and morbidity for AxFB are low and
similar to FFB.186 Reported outcomes are inferior to AFB,
IFB, and many series of FFB, with 5-year patency rates in
the 50% to 75% range, although the reported results are variable and also dependent on the severity of outﬂow disease.187 As a result of these limitations, AxFB is rarely
advised for patients with claudication. When used in circumstances such as aortic graft infection or mycotic aneurysm,
patients will often report some degree of functional limitation with aggressive exercise due to the inherent hemodynamic limitations of the long axillofemoral conduit.
