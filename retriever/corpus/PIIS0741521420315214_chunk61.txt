 suggest dedicated SMA angiography
through the SMA or CA with adequate imaging of the
entire SMA and CA mesenteric collateral system to precede TEVAR with intended or high risk for CA coverage.
(Ungraded good policy statement)
Recommendation 28: We recommend pre-emptive
SMA stenting with a balloon-expandable stent in cases
of >50% stenosis of the SMA in the following conditions:
before or after CA coverage or encroachment, with
TEVAR that is encroaching on the SMA origin, or in any
patient otherwise considered at high risk for postTEVAR mesenteric ischemia. Level of recommendation:
Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 29: In anticipation of high risk for CA
territory ischemia (nonvisualization of CA collateral
branches by CTA or dedicated SMA angiography), we
recommend open or endovascular revascularization of
the CA before TEVAR. Level of recommendation: Grade
1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Practice Statement: Maintain meticulous vigilance for
signs and symptoms of mesenteric and hepatic ischemia
early after CA coverage. (Ungraded good practice
statement)
Recommendation for access during TEVAR
Importantly, access-related issues remain a common
source of morbidity after TEVAR, although these complications are certainly decreasing with the increasing
lubricity and decreasing diameter of device delivery systems. In several early multicenter, industry-sponsored
trials, procedural failures ranged from 0.5% to 2% and
were almost all secondary to the inability to advance
the device through inadequate iliac arterial systems.80,89,90 There has been an effort recently to
decrease the size of the sheaths and to improve the
trackability of TEVAR delivery systems. Nonetheless, a
study of a lower proÔ¨Åle device (sheath sizes 16F-20F) still
had a 2% failure to implant secondary to access
issues.177
Depending on the size of the graft to be implanted, the
outer diameter of delivery systems can be larger than 24F
with some devices. One French is approximately 1/3 mm;
thus, a 24F outer diameter sheath is 8 mm in diameter. In
