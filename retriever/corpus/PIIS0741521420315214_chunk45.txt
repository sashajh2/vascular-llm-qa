spinal drains, multidisciplinary coordination, and rescue
procedures for those presenting with delayed SCI.113
Techniques for spinal cord protection after thoracic
aortic surgery have evolved signiﬁcantly during the last
four decades.96 Paraplegia after TEVAR limited to the
DTA is uncommon (<5%) compared with open aneurysm repair, despite the observation that TEVAR invariably covers intercostal branches. This highlights the fact
that the cause of SCI after open and endovascular repair
is multifactorial and not simply related to cessation of
intercostal artery perfusion. However, there are data
demonstrating that increased aortic coverage leads to
a higher risk of SCI, supporting the notion that the intercostal arteries are in fact an important source of spinal
cord perfusion.114 Of note, protocols are published
describing the complex interaction between mean arterial pressure and spinal cord pressure.115
Somatosensory and motor evoked potentials permit
continuous monitoring of the spinal cord’s function,
assist in the early detection of SCI, and are popular techniques used in high-risk cases during open TAA repair or

when patients are undergoing branched or fenestrated
endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).116,117 They are
rarely used in the setting of simple TEVAR.
Indications for prophylactic CSF drainage catheter
placement during TEVAR are controversial, and CSF
drains should be used as only one part of a multimodal
protocol to reduce the risk of SCI. Some authors recommend selective CSF drain placement for only high-risk
patients, whereas others perform CSF drain placement
preoperatively routinely.113,117-119 Risk factors for SCI after
TEVAR include length of aortic coverage (especially
when it is in excess of 15 cm of the DTA) and existence
of infrarenal aortic disease.120 In addition to these
anatomic risk factors, chronic renal failure may also be
an important risk factor.121 According to one systematic
review, the incidence of SCI after TEVAR with and
