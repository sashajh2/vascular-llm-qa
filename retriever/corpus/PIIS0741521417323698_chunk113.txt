 and similar to
STEMI management,462,463 the establishment of systems
of care will be necessary. With an organized regional
transfer system, operative repair can be performed in
>95% of patients with a ruptured AAA, with 67%
survival.458 This requires effective coordination between
established sending and receiving facilities with

standardized communication, a reliable transport provider, patient management guidelines during transfer,
and a streamlined process for operative repair. This goal
should be considered the longest time acceptable for
effective management of a patient with a ruptured aortic
aneurysm, and systems that are able to achieve even
more rapid times should be encouraged.
The benchmark of <90-minute door-to-balloon time
for the management of the patient with a STEMI was
initially extremely challenging to meet.461 In 2004, the
National Cardiovascular Data Registry reported that for
patients requiring interhospital transfer, only 8.6% had
total door-to-balloon times of <90 minutes, with a
median time of 152 minutes.464 Nonetheless, the establishment of an ambitious time goal promoted the development of STEMI systems of care to decrease time to
intervention and to improve overall patient survival.463
The challenge faced by rural centers was recognized
when the 2004 ACC/AHA guidelines were issued. However, with rapid triage, transfer, and STEMI treatment
programs, median total door-to-balloon times have
been driven down for rural hospitals from a median of
189 minutes to 88 minutes.465
We suggest a door-to-intervention time of <90 minutes,
based on a framework of 30-30-30 minutes, for the
management of the patient with a ruptured aneurysm.
