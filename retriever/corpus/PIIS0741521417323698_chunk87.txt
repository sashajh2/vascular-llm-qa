 diseased vessel and end organ, and anticipated morbidity and mortality risk of combined
repair. Prophylactic treatment of associated asymptomatic renal or mesenteric artery disease cannot be justiﬁed.354,355 The exception may be the patient presenting
with high-grade stenosis of the SMA and a meandering
mesenteric artery that is based off of a large IMA,
which will be sacriﬁced during the course of treatment.
A decision to repair each lesion should be based on its
own individual merits and indications. If endovascular
treatment is judged to be beneﬁcial, it is recommended that it be performed in a staged manner rather
than concomitantly with the planned EVAR procedure.
Iliac and femoral artery lesions may be treated at the
time of EVAR to facilitate endograft delivery and to
correct underlying disease that may be contributing
to lower extremity ischemic symptoms.
Accessory renal arteries are present in 15% to 20% of patients and occasionally may arise from the aneurysm itself.352 Whether an accessory renal artery requires
preservation depends on the size of the artery, its contribution to the renal parenchyma, and the presence of
coexisting kidney disease. Renal infarction after occlusion of an accessory renal artery is common, occurring
in 84% of kidneys, but it is well tolerated in most patients,
without signiﬁcant impact on long-term glomerular
ﬁltration rate.356 Nonetheless, preservation should be
considered for large accessory renal arteries ($3 mm) or
accessory renal arteries providing more than one-third
of arterial ﬂow to the kidney, particularly in the presence
of pre-existing renal dysfunction.357,358

We suggest prophylactic treatment of an asymptomatic, highgrade stenosis of the SMA in the presence of a meandering
mesenteric artery based off of a large IMA, which will be
sacriﬁced during the course of treatment.

We suggest preservation of accessory renal arteries at the time
of EVAR or OSR if the artery is 3 mm or larger in diameter or
supplies more than one-third of the renal parenchyma.
