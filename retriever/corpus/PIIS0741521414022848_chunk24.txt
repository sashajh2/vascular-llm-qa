Pentoxifylline was the ﬁrst drug approved by the FDA for
IC in 1984. By reducing blood viscosity and retarding platelet
aggregation, pentoxifylline use results in improved blood ﬂow
and enhanced tissue oxygenation in affected areas. Porter
et al91 revealed its effectiveness compared with placebo in a
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at seven centers with use in outpatients. Pentoxifylline increased pain-free
and maximal walking distance compared with placebo. Despite
its signiﬁcant ﬁndings in the Porter trial, clinical use of the drug
has been limited due to the difﬁculty in identifying the IC
patient who will predictably beneﬁt.95 Signiﬁcant positive effects on the ABI at rest or after exercise have not been appreciated in multiple trials.90,95,96 Although it has modest effect,

pentoxifylline is well tolerated, safe, and relatively inexpensive.
Dosing begins at 400-mg tablets three times per day and can
be titrated up to 1800 mg/d. Side effects of nausea, headache,
drowsiness, and anorexia have precluded long-term use in
some patients. Hypertension can be exacerbated with use.
Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that suppresses platelet aggregation and is also a direct vasodilator.
Patients can notice improvement in maximal and pain-free
walking distance in as short as 4 weeks.92 Other phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been noted to increase mortality in
patients with advanced heart failure; thus, cilostazol is contraindicated in patients with any level of heart failure. In addition to improving blood ﬂow to the limb,
