ning stenosis in stented arteries.464,466,467 A review of 14 studies suggested
recording Doppler parameters of the recently stented
vessel soon after CAS and using these values as the patient’s reference point. This new reference point will
guide future routine surveillance scans.468
Clinical impact
The clinical impact of signiﬁcant restenosis after CAS is
uncertain, but neointimal hyperplasia seems to be associated with reduced potential for embolization
compared with native lesions.467,469 In most trials, a
higher incidence of in-stent restenosis during follow-up
did not impact complication rates, suggesting that it
might be a relatively benign disease.465,470,471 However,
analysis of the CREST trial showed greater risk for

ipsilateral stroke after the periprocedural period up to
the end of follow-up period in patients who had restenosis or occlusion within 2 years compared with those who
did not have restenosis (HR, 4.37; 95% CI, 1.91-10.03; P ¼
.0005, adjusted for age, sex, and symptomatic status).453
A meta-analysis of surveillance data from a randomized
trial involving CEA/CAS demonstrated that patients who
had CAS had a 10% incidence of greater than 70% stenosis/occlusion at mean follow-up of 62 months. Notably,
only 1 of 125 were associated with an ipsilateral stroke.462
Management
The management of patients with recurrent stenosis after CAS is clinically challenging, and no consensus on the
best treatment modality is currently available.472 Owing
to its low incidence, no prospective study has compared
treatment options for in-stent restenosis. The choice
should therefore be made on a case-by-case basis with
careful analysis of lesion features and the patient’s proﬁle.
In the future, adequately powered trials using a uniform
deﬁnition and standardized workup for in-stent restenosis are s necessary to determine the appropriateness of
interventions for in-stent restenosis.
