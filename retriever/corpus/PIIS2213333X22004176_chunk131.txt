Supplementary Table III (online only). Evidence to decision framework: endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) vs high ligation
and stripping (HL&S) vs compression stockings in patients with symptomatic varicose veins and axial reﬂux in superﬁcial
truncal veins
Domain

Evidence/panel input

Judgment

How substantial are desirable anticipated
effects of the strategy?

Decrease in perioperative pain and earlier
return to normal activity and reduced risk of
varicosities at 5 years are more likely with
endovenous venous intervention; HL&S was
associated with higher anatomic closure
rates at 30 days and 5 years compared with
RFA and UGFS, with no signiﬁcant difference
compared with EVLA at 5 years

Moderate

How substantial are the undesirable
anticipated effects?

Increased risk of pigmentation and some
procedural pain are expected; need for
analgesia is higher with ligation and
stripping

Small

Do the desirable effects outweigh the
undesirable effects?

For most patients, the desirable effects will
outweigh the undesirable effects

Yes

Is there important uncertainty or variability
about how much people value the main
outcomes?

Studies on patient preference demonstrate
signiﬁcant heterogeneity in patient
preferences, with one study reporting that
most patients are not concerned about
missing work, and another reporting that
cost was the most important component,
with variable responses regarding ranking of
discomfort and long-term risk of recurrence;
given that superﬁcial venous disease is a
chronic disease and a consensus is lacking
regarding patient preference, the
committee prioritized QoL at 5 years and
recurrence/need for reintervention over
short-term results

Possibly
important
uncertainty or
variability

What is the overall certainty of the
evidence of effects?

Moderate certainty for venous intervention vs
compression stockings; low certainty for
head-to-head comparisons

Moderate

How large are the resource requirements
associated with the intervention?

The type of insurance will often drive costs and
out-of-pocket expenses; out-of-pocket
procedural costs have varied widely

Unknown

How large is the incremental cost relative
to the net beneﬁt?
