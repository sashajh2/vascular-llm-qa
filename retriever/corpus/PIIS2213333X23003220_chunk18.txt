11. Management of ablation-related thrombus extension (ARTE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after endovenous ablations
11.1.3.

In a high-risk patient who is asymptomatic following thermal or nonthermal saphenous ablation early DUS to exclude ARTE
or DVT should be performed.

In patients who are symptomatic following thermal or nonthermal ablation, we

11.2. Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis

For high-risk patients undergoing endovenous ablation we suggest pharmacological
thromboprophylaxis.

Consensus statement
11.2.2.

For patients undergoing endovenous ablation routine risk stratiÔ¨Åcation should be performed to assess the need for
periprocedural thromboprophylaxis.

For patients with acute isolated distal DVT after varicose vein procedure, without
symptoms or risk factors for extension, we suggest serial imaging of the deep veins for
2 weeks.
