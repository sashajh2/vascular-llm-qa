Alcohol agents. Alcohol agents are weak sclerosants
that cause irreversible endothelial damage by contact. Glycerin is a corrosive agent that destroys the cell surface
proteins by affecting chemical bonds. Chromated glycerin
is used most frequently as a solution of glycerin, sterile
water, and benzyl alcohol (Chromex, Omega Laboratory).
It is not approved in the United States. It is usually mixed
with 1% lidocaine and epinephrine. Chromated glycerin is
safe and rarely leads to tissue necrosis, hyperpigmentation,
or allergy. Suitable for treatment of small veins or telangiectasia, it may cause hematuria when used in a higher
concentration.
Liquid sclerotherapy. The sclerosing chemicals need
to be diluted before use, and the concentration of the
solution should be the lowest when used for treatment of
very small diameter veins, such as telangiectasia. Recommended concentrations of STS and polidocanol are listed in
Table VIII.
Liquid sclerotherapy is performed using small tuberculin syringes and a 30- or 32-gauge needle. Treatment is
usually started with larger varicose veins and ends with
reticular veins and telangiectasia. The proximal part of the
limb is treated first and the distal part second. Using loupes
for magnification and transillumination (Veinlite, TransLite, Sugar Land, Tex; VeinViewer, Luminetx, Memphis,
Tenn) helps intraluminal injection and avoids extravasation
of the drug. The injection maximum of 1.0 mL of the
chemical to one site is recommended, with not
