AL vs Vascu-Guard patching in 200 CEA and
they concluded that there was no signiﬁcant differences
in perioperative/late neurologic events and late restenosis in the two groups.
Oldenburg et al309 reported on durability of CEA with a
bovine pericardial patch in a retrospective analysis of 874
consecutive patients who underwent CEA at the Mayo
Clinic in Florida. A bovine pericardial patch was used in
680 patients (group I) and other CEA techniques were
used in 194 patients (group II) (standard without patch,
78; standard with vein patch, 16; standard with Dacron,
74; and other techniques: bypasses, 26). There were no
signiﬁcant differences in 30-day mortality or morbidity
between the 2 groups, except that group I had a lower
30-day stroke risk (0.1%) than group II (1.5%; P ¼ .03).
Ten-year freedom from stroke/TIA and freedom from
restenosis was also similar between groups. The authors
concluded that CEA with bovine pericardium angioplasty had excellent early and late outcomes with minimal morbidity and mortality.
More recently, Texakalidis et al310 reported the results of a
meta-analysis of 18 randomized trials comparing bovine
pericardium and other patch materials for CEA, noting
similar ﬁndings when comparing synthetic patches vs
bovine pericardium. As noted in Table VI, the outcome
for various patches in CEA were also somewhat similar.
Carotid eversion: eversion CEA versus traditional
endarterectomy
Eversion CEA (ECEA) is a technique that can be used for
most carotid bifurcation disease. It may be best indicated in patients with short bifurcation lesions, those
with elongated ICAs (coils and kinks) and in cases with

high bifurcations. The most commonly-accepted technique is that the ICA is transected while removing the
bulk of the plaque from the CCA as the ICA is transected.
This is followed by everting the distal media or the
external elastic lamina and
