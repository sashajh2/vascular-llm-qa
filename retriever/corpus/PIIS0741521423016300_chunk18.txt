 lower limb including frequent presentation of
infragenicular arterial occlusive disease, with an increased
risk of amputation.31e33 The diagnosis of PAD and chronic
limb threatening ischaemia (CLTI) is frequently complicated by the absence of classical symptoms of PAD such
as intermittent claudication and rest pain, probably due
to factors such as sedentary lifestyle and loss of pain sensation due to diabetes related peripheral neuropathy, which
is present in the majority of people with an (ischaemic)
DFU.30,32 Co-existent medial artery calciﬁcation (MAC),
which is also associated with peripheral neuropathy, is
common and can affect the accuracy of non-invasive tests
such as the ankle brachial index (ABI) by causing elevation
of ankle and, to a lesser extent, digital pressures.34
In people with diabetes early diagnosis of PAD is essential.29 The disease process is associated with greater likelihood of delayed or non-healing of DFU, gangrene, and
amputation in addition to increased rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.35 The prognosis of a person with diabetes, PAD, and foot ulceration requiring
amputation is worse than for many common cancers,
up to 50% of people will not survive ﬁve years.26,36 PAD
places the person at very high risk of adverse cardiovascular events and thus optimal medical management of
cardiovascular risk factors should be ensured.32 Early
and adequate assessment of foot perfusion is necessary
to ensure that elevated risk of delayed or poor wound
healing and amputation is identiﬁed early so this can
be addressed without treatment delay.
Despite the severity of the outcomes of PAD in people with diabetes, and particularly for those with DFU,
there are few practice guidelines that speciﬁcally
address the diagnosis and management of PAD in
this population. Formulating recommendations for
this speciﬁc population should take into account the
multisystem nature of diabetes and the impact of
other diabetes complications on the utility of diagnostic tests, wound healing, amputation, and survival
outcomes. One of the guidelines that speciﬁcally
addressed these topics has been that of the IWGDF,
with the last version produced in 2019.37 Instead of
making a new updated version, the IWG
