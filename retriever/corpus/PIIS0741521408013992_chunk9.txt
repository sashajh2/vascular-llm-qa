is placed and ready to be used.20,21 Many patients are not
referred to a nephrologist until their kidney disease is already
quite advanced, allowing little opportunity for vascular access
placement before dialysis is initiated.17,22,23
Not surprisingly, patients who are referred to nephrologists before the initiation of dialysis are more likely to
undergo vascular access surgery before dialysis begins.24
More frequent utilization of nephrology care before the
initiation of dialysis also appears to be associated with a
lower risk of catheter use at the initiation of dialysis.24
Avorn et al24 found that patients referred to a nephrologist
⬍90 days before the initiation of dialysis were approximately 40% more likely to undergo catheter placement
compared with those who were seen ⬎90 days before the
initiation of dialysis. Frequency of nephrology care was also
important. Those who had fewer than three visits to a
nephrologist within the year before dialysis initiation were
40% more likely to have a catheter than those who had three
or more visits.24
In addition, predialysis nephrology referral is associated
with a shorter duration of catheter use after the initiation of
dialysis and with a greater likelihood of autogenous access
placement.25 Nevertheless, even among patients referred to
a nephrologist well in advance of the need for dialysis, most
start dialysis with a catheter rather than a permanent vascular access.20,22,25 Therefore, the need for CKD/pre-ESRD
programs is crucial to ensuring that patients are evaluated
early to receive the optimal renal replacement therapy and
permanent hemodialysis access (if hemodialysis is chosen).
The average maturation time of a new autogenous
access is 2 to 4 months.26-30 In addition, a patient whose
access fails to mature sufficiently to support hemodialysis

needs to undergo additional procedures to promote autogenous access maturation or place a new vascular access, or
both. Hemodialysis patients are usually dialyzed through a
central venous catheter while this process is
