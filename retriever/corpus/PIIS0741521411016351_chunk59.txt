ST both demonstrated the benefit of CEA in neurologically symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis that reduced diameter ⬎50%.2-4 NASCET demonstrated an absolute risk reduction in stroke of 17% at 2 years (24% in
medical arm vs 7% in surgical arm) for patients with ⬎70%
carotid stenosis. ECST demonstrated a similar stroke risk in
this group after 3 years in the medical arm, 26.5% with a
stroke risk in the surgical group of 7%, an absolute reduction of 14.9%. In both studies, the risk of stroke in the
medical arm, and therefore the benefit of CEA, increased
with the degree of stenosis. The results of these trials firmly
established CEA as the treatment of choice for patients with
severe carotid stenosis and are widely accepted throughout
the medical community. The benefit of CEA in more
moderate stenosis of 50% to 69% was more moderate—
15.7% stroke after CEA vs 22.2% stroke with medical
therapy at 5 years— but still statistically significant.3 Stenoses ⬍50% were not benefited by CEA.
2. CAS in symptomatic stenosis. A number of trials
have examined the role of CAS in the management of
neurologically symptomatic patients with ⬎50% diameter
stenosis. As previously mentioned, SAPPHIRE demonstrated overall equivalence of CAS and CEA in the management of carotid stenosis, although the number of symptomatic patients was too small for subgroup analysis.94 Two
large prospective randomized European trials, EVA-3S162
and SPACE1,228 examined the role of CAS vs CEA in
neurologically symptomatic patients. EVA-3S showed a
statistically inferior outcome for CAS compared with CEA
(stroke death, 9.5% vs 3.8%) in these patients. This study
was criticized because of the relatively low level of experience (minimum of 25 CAS cases) required in the CAS arm.
