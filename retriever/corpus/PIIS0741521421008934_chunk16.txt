large patient populations.7,30,31 The role of TF-CAS or transcervical carotid artery revascularization (TCAR) is even less
clear because no completed studies have compared
these treatments for patients with asymptomatic carotid
stenosis against best medical therapy.
Several upcoming, multicenter randomized trials have
been designed to answer the role of modern pharmacologic therapy in the management of asymptomatic
carotid stenosis. These trials include the SPACE-II
(stent-protected angioplasty in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis) study25 and CREST-2.32
Recommendation 1.1: In low surgical risk patients
with asymptomatic carotid bifurcation atherosclerosis
and stenosis of >70% (documented by validated
duplex ultrasound or computed tomography angiography [CTA]/angiography), we recommend CEA with
best medical therapy over maximal medical therapy
alone for the long-term prevention of stroke and death
(grade IB).

Evidence and rationale
Once a patient with clinically signiﬁcant symptomatic carotid stenosis has been identiﬁed, appropriate treatment
must be selected. Treatment is primarily directed at the
reduction of stroke risk. In general, the rates of stroke,
myocardial infarction (MI), and death have been used
when comparing CAS against CEA. In most clinical trials
comparing CAS with CEA, stroke, MI, and death have
been given equal weight in determining a composite
endpoint to test overall efﬁcacy. Data from the CREST (carotid revascularization endarterectomy vs stenting trial),9
however, indicated that stroke has a
