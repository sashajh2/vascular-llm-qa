venous terms)
Term

Deﬁnition

Axial reﬂux

Uninterrupted retrograde venous ﬂow from groin to calf; superﬁcial reﬂux conﬁned to superﬁcial
venous system; deep reﬂux conﬁned to deep venous system; combined reﬂux involves any
combination of the three main venous systems (superﬁcial, deep, perforating)

Chronic venous disorders

Includes full spectrum of morphologic and functional abnormalities of venous system

Chronic venous disease

Morphologic and functional abnormalities of venous system of long duration manifested by
symptoms or signs, or both, indicating need for investigation and/or care

Chronic venous insufﬁciency

Reserved for advanced chronic venous disease (CEAP class C3-C6) applied to functional
abnormalities of venous system producing edema, skin changes, or venous ulcers

Congenital venous reﬂux

Retrograde venous ﬂow of abnormal duration in any venous segment, caused by the absence or
abnormal development of venous valves

Mechanochemical ablation
(Mocca procedure)

A nontumescent, nonthermal technique to ablate superﬁcial truncal veins; an oscillating rotating
wire is used to disrupt endothelial lining of target veins, allowing for simultaneous injection of
sclerosant to penetrate deeper layers of vein wall, ultimately resulting in vein sclerosis and
obstruction

Miniphlebectomy

Removal of a vein segment through a small skin incision or stab wound; synonyms include
phlebectomy, ambulatory phlebectomy, microphlebectomy, and stab phlebectomy

Nontruncal vein

Unnamed or nonlongitudinal saphenous or deep vein

Post-thrombotic syndrome

Chronic venous symptoms and/or signs secondary to deep vein thrombosis and its sequelae

Primary venous reﬂux

Retrograde ven
