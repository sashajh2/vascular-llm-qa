 aortic aneurysms have recommended (2C) “prophylactic treatment of asymptomatic,
high-grade stenosis of the SMA in the presence of a
meandering mesenteric artery based off a large IMA,
which will be sacriﬁced during the course of treatment”.103 The choice of revascularization included both
endovascular and open approaches, with the former
approach generally favored provided that the lesions
are amenable. A study from the National Inpatient Sample reported that simultaneous renal revascularization at
the time of open infrarenal aneurysm repair was associated with an increased mortality rate and the ﬁndings
are likely applicable to combined mesenteric revascularization.104,105 Single institution series have reported
somewhat equivocal ﬁndings in terms of the increased
morbidity and mortality associated with simultaneous
mesenteric revascularization.7,106,107 Unfortunately, it is
unclear from the nationwide and single institution series
whether the simultaneous mesenteric revascularization
increased or decreased the overall mortality rate for the
underlying condition given the lack of appropriate controls. Patients with CMI who require aortic reconstruction
for either occlusive or aneurysmal disease require
mesenteric revascularization as outlined for patients
with CMI alone. The mesenteric revascularization should
be performed before or simultaneous with the aortic
reconstruction for patients with CMI, as recommended
by the Society for Vascular Surgery’s guidelines for
abdominal aortic aneurysms.103 Notably, they state that
patients with symptomatic disease of the SMA (ie, CMI)
should undergo angioplasty and stenting before open
or endovascular repair (1A), whereas those who are not
amenable to an endovascular approach should undergo
concomitant revascularization at the time of open aneurysm repair (1A).
Aneurysms can develop within the major mesenteric
vessels and their collateral networks. One of the presumed mechanisms is the hemodynamic forces that
result from the increased ﬂow through the collateral
