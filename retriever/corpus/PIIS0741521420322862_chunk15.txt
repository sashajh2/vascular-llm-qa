response occurring within 30 to 90 minutes.20 The majority of the increased blood ﬂow is via the SMA as reﬂected by the marked increased end-diastolic velocity
(EDV) noted on DUS imaging during a meal challenge.21
Within the bowel wall itself, the quantity of blood ﬂow is
greater in the mucosa than the submucosa or muscularis, thereby making the mucosa layer more susceptible to
an ischemic insult.22 In patients with CMI, the postprandial hyperemic response is blunted or decreased owing
to the occluded or stenotic mesenteric vessels. This can
result in a mismatch between the supply and demand
for oxygen and other metabolites, leading to pain
(visceral nerves), malabsorption (intestinal mucosa), and
bowel emptying (peristalsis), the cardinal symptoms of
CMI.23-25
The overwhelming majority of patients with CMI have
atherosclerotic occlusive disease as the underlying etiology. The occlusive disease usually affects the oriﬁce and
ﬁrst few centimeters of the mesenteric vessels with relative sparing of the distal segment, and this oriﬁcal process is usually associated with plaque within the aorta.4
The MAOD is a manifestation of a systemic process and
patients typically present with the standard atherosclerotic risk factors and involvement in the other vascular
beds. The breakdown of the cardiovascular risk factors
and comorbidities among patients undergoing revascularization identiﬁed in the accompanying meta-analysis
is shown in Table I.12 Notably, the mean patient age
among all patients was 68.7 years and the majority
were smokers, hypertensive, and had evidence of peripheral artery disease. Unlike most other cardiovascular disorders associated with atherosclerotic occlusive disease,
the majority of patients with CMI are women. There is a

small percentage of patients that present in the third
to fourth decades of life and may have a
