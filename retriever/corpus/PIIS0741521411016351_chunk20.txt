 testing should be done in an accredited
vascular laboratory (eg, Intersocietal Commission for the
Accreditation of Vascular Laboratories), and the images
should be reviewed by physicians experienced in vascular
ultrasound interpretation.
Determining the degree of carotid artery stenosis is
largely based on an analysis of the peak systolic velocity
(PSV) or the end-diastolic velocity (EDV), or both, of the
carotid artery. A panel of experts from several medical
specialties convened in October 2002 in San Francisco,
California, under the auspices of the Society of Radiologists
in Ultrasound, to arrive at a consensus regarding the performance of Doppler US imaging to aid in the diagnosis of
ICA stenosis.68 This panel of experts recommended a cutoff PSV of the ICA of ⱖ125 cm/s for predicting angio-

on an analysis of several published studies and the experience of the panelists rather than values validated against
other imaging modalities.
AbuRahma et al69 recently analyzed the CDUS and
angiography results of 376 carotid arteries in their institution. Using the consensus criteria, they demonstrated a
sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 68%, and overall accuracy of
85% for stenosis between 50% and 69%. A PSV of ⱖ230
cm/s for ⱖ70% stenosis had a sensitivity of 99%, specificity
of 86%, and overall accuracy of 95%. Receiver operator
curves showed that the ICA PSV was significantly better
than EDV or ICA/CCA ratio (P ⫽ .036) in detecting
ⱖ70% stenosis and ⱖ50% stenosis. There was no improvement in accuracy by adding the EDV values or the ratios, or
both, to the PSV values.
Velocity-based estimation of carotid artery stenosis may
