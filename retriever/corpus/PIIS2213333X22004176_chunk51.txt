88,89) requires tumescent local anesthesia, which
can cause pain and discomfort during the procedure.
Nonthermal ablations include UGFS with physiciancompounded foam using the Tessari technique98,99 or
the use of PEM (Varithena).100 Other nonthermal ablation
techniques include CAC12,90,91 using the VenaSeal system
(Medtronic) or the Turkish glue kit (VariClose Vein Sealing
System; Biolas) and mechanicochemical ablation, such
as the MOCA procedure.94-97 All nonthermal ablations
can be performed without the need for tumescent
anesthesia. The heterogeneity of nonthermal techniques
does not allow for a direct comparison of all thermal and
all nonthermal ablations.

comparative observational studies.11,150,151,183-190 The review found signiﬁcantly higher visual analog scale for
pain scores perioperatively for EVLA than for CAC or
UGFS, using physician-compounded foam.172,177,185 The
early QoL scores in some studies were also better for
UGFS99 and the MOCA procedure95 than for EVLA. At
1 year, however, EVLA was associated with higher
anatomic closure rates than UGFS (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.111.37; I2 ¼ 0.00%).133,177,185 Compared with physiciancompounded UGFS, EVLA and RFA were also associated with a lower risk of recurrence (RR, 0.
