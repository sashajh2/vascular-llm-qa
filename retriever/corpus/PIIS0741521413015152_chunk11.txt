Grade 2: AP 55-69 mm Hg, ABI 0.5-0.69, TP
30-54 mm Hg;
Grade 3: AP <55 mm Hg, ABI <0.5,
TP <30 mm Hg

Yes, grades 0-3;
Grade 0: none;
Grade 1: mild. erythema 0.5-2 cm, induration,
tenderness, warmth and purulence;
Grade 2: moderate, erythema >2 cm, abscess,
muscle tendon, joint, or bone infection;
Grade 3: severe, systemic response (similar to
IDSA)

Detailed system intended only for DFUs; Detailed
comprehensive ulcer classiﬁcation system and
hemodynamic categories for gradation of
ischemia; Gangrene not considered separately
Infection system similar to IDSA

No

Yes, uninfected, mild, moderate, and severe
(Table II)

Yes, ischemia grades 0-3;
Hemodynamics with spectrum of perfusion
abnormalities; No cutoff value for CLI;
Grade 0: unlikely to require revascularization

Yes, IDSA system (Table II)

Validated system for risk of amputation related to
foot infection, but not designed to address
wound depth/complexity or degree of ischemia
Includes PAD þ diabetes with spectrum of
wounds, ischemia and infection, scaled from 03; No cutoff for CLI. Need for revascularization
depends on degree of ischemia, wound and/or
infection severity; Ulcers/gangrene categorized
based on extent and complexity of anticipated
ablative surgery/coverage

neuroischemia is now the most common etiology of DFUs
in most western countries. The estimated current prevalence rates of neuropathic, ischemic, and neuroischemic
ulcers in patients with diabetes are 35%, 15%, and 50%,
respectively.30
An adequate classiﬁcation system that risk stratiﬁes
patients and aids in clinical decision-making represents an
enormous unmet need in the ﬁeld of
