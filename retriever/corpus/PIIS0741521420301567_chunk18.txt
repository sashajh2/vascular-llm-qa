 (Low).
3.3: In patients with appropriate anatomy, we suggest
transcatheter embolization with liquid embolic agents
as a treatment option for both GDAA and PDAA. Level
of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
3.4: In patients with suitable anatomy, we suggest ﬂowdiverting, multilayered stents as a treatment option for
GDAA and PDAA, although these have not been
adequately studied to be recommended as a primary
treatment modality. Level of Recommendation: Grade
2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
3.5: In patients with nonruptured aneurysms, we
suggest open surgical reconstruction if needed to preserve ﬂow. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
3.6: In patients with concomitant stenosis or occlusion,
we suggest celiac artery reconstruction. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B
(Moderate).
4.1: In patients with median arcuate ligament
syndrome, we suggest screening for GDAA or PDAA

with CTA or duplex ultrasound. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
5.1: In patients status post treatment of GDAA and
PDAA, we recommend follow-up imaging after endovascular treatment of GDAA and PDAA to rule out
persistent ﬂow through the aneurysm sac. Level of
Recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of
Evidence: B (Moderate).

INTRODUCTION
Aneurysms of the visceral arteries are a rare but
clinically important vascular condition. Of all intraabdominal aneurysms, only approximately 5% affect
the visceral arteries. Visceral artery aneurysms include
both true aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms. Many
true visceral artery aneurysms are degenerative or
atherosclerotic in nature, with histologic specimens
demonstrating reduced smooth muscle, disruption of
elastic ﬁbers, and deﬁciency of the arterial media.1
Other common causes of visceral artery aneurysms
include ﬁbromuscular dysplasia,
