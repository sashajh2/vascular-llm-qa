entially for the identiﬁcation of patients at high VTE
risk in whom the beneﬁt of receiving chemical chemoprophylaxis outweighs the attendant bleeding risk. A
widely accepted risk threshold is a calculated VTE risk
of 3%, assuming a two-fold reduction in VTE events
compared with expected bleeding events from administration of an anticoagulant.241 Currently, no VTE risk
assessment model (RAM) has been validated in patients
undergoing varicose vein procedures.
Indirect evidence suggests that risk stratifying patients
undergoing varicose vein procedures may have potential
beneﬁts. Namely, among patients undergoing a variety of
ambulatory surgical procedures, those undergoing procedures for varicose vein procedures are at the highest
risk for development of VTE.249 Second, variations in
VTE rate among patients undergoing venous procedures
have been identiﬁed according to patient and procedure
related characteristics. For instance, patients undergoing
open surgery or longer operations are at greater risk at
developing VTE.250 Third, limited evidence suggests
that those with a higher composite VTE RAM score,
such as that used in the Caprini RAM, have an increased
VTE and ARTE risk.251 Finally, a recent meta-analysis suggested that in patients undergoing inpatient and outpatient surgical procedures (including those undergoing
venous procedures) with a Caprini score of $7 beneﬁted
from chemoprophylaxis in terms of VTE risk reduction
without an increase in bleeding.252 This data highlights
the critical need to determine from a speciﬁc VTE RAM
the threshold at which chemical thromboprophylaxis is
favorable for the patient undergoing outpatient axial
and/or tributary bed treatment. Future studies should
likely focus on clinically relevant venous thromboembolic events (DVT, PE) and should include some measure
of risk.
