 compared with
age-matched controls.84 Bahia and colleagues recently
conducted a systematic review of long-term survival after
aneurysm repair.84 Patients with large aneurysms, at
greatest risk of rupture, also had signiﬁcantly worse 5year survival. As one would anticipate, many of the
same risk factors for perioperative death also have an
impact on life expectancy. One-year survival after hospital admission for heart failure is 60%. One-year survival
after initiation of dialysis is 85% but decreases for those
with signiﬁcant comorbidities to 60%. The 3-year survival
after initiation of home oxygen therapy for COPD is 60%.
In the EVAR 2 trial, patients with severe coronary artery
disease, COPD, or poor renal function were considered
ineligible for open repair. Whereas the study has been
criticized for its trial design, EVAR did not affect overall
survival. Two-year survival was 60% and 5-year survival
was 35%.309 De Martino and coworkers assessed survival
after EVAR within the Vascular Study Group of New
England population using the EVAR 2 trial criteria.310
Five-year survival for patients with aneurysms smaller
than 6.5 cm was 46%; and for patients with aneurysms
