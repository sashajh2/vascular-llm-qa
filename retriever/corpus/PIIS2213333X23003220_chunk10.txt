icose veins and axial reﬂux in the GSV or SSV, we
recommend treatment with HL&S of the saphenous vein if technology or expertise in
endovenous ablation is not available or if the venous anatomy precludes endovenous
treatment.

B
(moderate)

4.1.5.

For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and axial reﬂux in the AAGSV or PAGSV, we 2 (weak)
suggest treatment with ligation and stripping of the accessory saphenous vein, with
additional phlebectomy, if needed, if technology or expertise in endovenous ablations is
not available or if the venous anatomy precludes endovenous treatment.

C (low to
very low)

4.1.6.

For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and axial reﬂux in the GSV who place a high 2 (weak)
priority on the long-term outcomes of treatment (quality of life [QOL] and recurrence), we
suggest treatment with endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA),
or HL&S over physician-compounded ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS),
because of long-term improvement of QOL and reduced recurrence

B
(moderate)

4.1.7.

For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and axial reﬂux in the SSV, we suggest
2 (weak)
treatment with EVLA, RFA, or ligation and stripping from the knee to the upper or midcalf
over physician-compounded UGFS because of long-term improvement of QOL and
reduced recurrence

C (low to
very low)

4.1.8.

For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and axial reﬂux in the AAGSV or PAGSV who 2 (weak)
place a high priority on the long-term outcomes of treatment (QOL and recurrence), we
suggest treatment of the reﬂuxing superﬁcial trunk with endovenous laser ablation, RFA,
or HL&S, with additional phlebectomy, if needed, over physician-compounded UGFS
because of long-term improvement of QOL and reduced recurrence
