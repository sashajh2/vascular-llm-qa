 occurred in the per protocol
symptomatic patients in ROADSTER-2 for a combined
30-day stroke and death rate of 0.6%.44,45 A more recent
study examined 3286 propensity-matched patients from
the VQI and demonstrated a signiﬁcantly lower incidence of in-hospital stroke and death for the patients
treated with TCAR vs TF-CAS (1.6% vs 3.1%; RR, 0.51; 95%
CI, 0.37-.72).47 No difference was found in MI between
the groups. Finally, Malas et al48 examined a more recent
cohort of patients from the VQI Transcarotid Revascularization Project. These investigators propensity score
matched 6384 pairs of patients who had undergone
either TCAR or CEA. In this cohort, 3333 symptomatic patients were compared.48 No differences were found in the
in-hospital stroke and death rates between the symptomatic patients undergoing TCAR vs CEA (2.2% vs 2.6%; P ¼
.46), and TCAR was associated with a lower incidence of

Evidence and rationale
Acute stroke is often associated with intracranial
thrombosis or embolization. Thus, a major management goal is to identify those patients with intracranial
occlusions and to reperfuse the ischemic brain as
rapidly as possible. Primarily, therapy should be directed
at the intracranial occlusion that affects a signiﬁcant
amount of the vasculature and resultant brain at risk.
Only w15% of patients with acute stroke will present
within the 6-hour window for acute intervention. However, as techniques and diagnosis have improved, neurointerventionalists have expanded this therapeutic
window.
Many patients present outside this 6-hour therapeutic
window. Intervention for these patients is directed at
the carotid bifurcation rather than the intracranial circulation, with the goal of preventing recurrent events rather
than re-establishing intracranial ﬂow in the occluded
arteries.
However, for patients with acute stroke who present
obtunded or severely neurologically debilitated, it is
