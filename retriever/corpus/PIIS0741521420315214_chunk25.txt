 as to the exact mechanisms by which primary mycotic TAAs occur; they may be due to hematogenous dissemination of microorganisms, direct
involvement of the intima, or extension from a nearby
septic focus. An intimal disruption, such as in atherosclerotic plaque, may be a site of bacterial lodgment, and
histologic specimens have often demonstrated neutrophilic inﬁltration and atherosclerotic change in the
same aortic wall. Pre-existing trauma or aneurysm may
also facilitate the onset of the infectious process. Histopathologic ﬁndings consist of variable elastic ﬁber
degeneration, partial or complete lumen obliteration,
compensatory ﬁbrosis with increased thickness of the
aortic wall, and perivascular chronic inﬁltrate. It is
important to exclude infection in all saccular TAAs as
w93% of mycotic aneurysms have this appearance on
computed tomography angiography (CTA).40

aneurysm into the esophagus. The main etiologic factor
contributing to aortoesophageal ﬁstula is aortic disease,
with more than half of cases being secondary to rupture
of an aneurysm of the DTA into the esophagus. Aortobronchial ﬁstula41 is also a rare but potentially lifethreatening cause of hemoptysis if it is not adequately
treated. In younger patients, aortobronchial ﬁstula is
more frequently seen secondary to surgical repair of
congenital heart defects and aortic coarctation repair.
However, most aortobronchial ﬁstulas originate from a
descending atherosclerotic aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm, which causes an erosion of the lung parenchyma
