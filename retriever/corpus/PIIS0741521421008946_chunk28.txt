Breakthrough ischemic events may occur in some patients who are compliant with aspirin therapy owing to
aspirin resistance. There is some evidence that aspirin’s
reduced antithrombotic efﬁcacy may be more common
in patients who take enteric coated aspirin or lower dose
therapy (81 mg) compared with those taking uncoated
aspirin (325 mg).125 However, routine laboratory testing
for platelet reactivity is not supported by the evidence.126
Three randomized clinical trials compared aspirin with
anticoagulation with warfarin among patients with noncardioembolic TIA or stroke. These studies failed to
demonstrate superiority of anticoagulation over antiplatelet therapy in reducing the incidence of ischemic
events, although there was an increased incidence of
bleeding complications associated with anticoagulation.127-129 A recent meta-analysis of eight clinical trials
comparing anticoagulation with antiplatelet therapy for
secondary prevention of stroke identiﬁed no difference
in prevention of vascular events.130
In addition to aspirin, clopidogrel, the combination
agent aspirin þ dipyridamole, and dual antiplatelet therapy have all been investigated in this clinical scenario but
the optimal regimen is not clear. In the Clopidogrel vs
Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events (CAPRIE)
trial, there was a small advantage of clopidogrel over
aspirin in reducing overall ischemic events.131 However,
analysis of a subset of patients with a prior history of
stroke in the CAPRIE trial demonstrated no difference
in incidence of vascular events.131 In the European/Australasian Stroke Prevention in Reversible Ischemia Trial,
patients were randomized to aspirin or aspirin þ
extended release dipyridamole therapy within 6 months
of a TIA or stroke. The study showed a statistically significant lower rate of
