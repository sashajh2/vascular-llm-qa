Recurrent varicosity. Compared with RFA, HL/S was
signiﬁcantly associated with recurrent varicosity (RR,
2.00; 95% CI, 1.22-3.27; 1 study103). No statistically

signiﬁcant associations were found when HL/S was
compared with EVLA and UGFS (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.581.18; I2 ¼ 83.6%; 3 studies50,102,103) and (RR, 1.06; 95% CI,
0.74-1.54; I2 ¼ 65.60%; 2 studies102,103), respectively.
Recurrent varicosity scale. Compared with HL/S, UGFS
was associated with a higher recurrent varicosity score
(SMD, e0.33; 95% CI, e0.50 to e0.17; 1 study102). Outcomes are presented in Supplementary Table V (online

Adverse events.
Minor AEs. Compared with RFA, HL/S was signiﬁcantly
associated with increased risk of minor AEs (RR, 1.70; 95%
CI, 1.17-2.48; I2 ¼ 75.1%; 10 studies33,36,38,39,51,57,58,71,104,109).
No statistically signiﬁcant association was found when
HL/S was compared with EVLA (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.761.28; I2 ¼ 78.4%; 12 studies34,37,49,61-64,69,73,101,104,108). HL/S
was associated with lower risk of minor AEs than U
