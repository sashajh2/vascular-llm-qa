2.3.2. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the AAGSV or PAGSV, we suggest
treatment with ligation and stripping of the accessory
GSV, with additional phlebectomy, if needed, if the
technology or expertise in endovenous ablation is not
available or the venous anatomy precludes endovenous treatment.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak), quality of
evidence: C (low to very low)
Rationale and evidence. New technology might not be
available in some health care systems or the devices can
be too expensive for patients or facilities when no reimbursement for the procedure will be provided by thirdparty payors. In addition, aneurysmal dilation of the
GSV close to the SFJ, a subcutaneous location of a
truncal superﬁcial vein above the saphenous fascia and
close to the skin, and tortuosity of the GSV or SSV (Fig 2)
are relative anatomic contraindications to some endovenous procedures.
Although the systematic review supporting these
guidelines found a twofold greater 5-year risk of recurrent varicosities after high ligation and saphenous stripping compared with RFA (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.22-3.27),19
the ﬁndings was based on a single study with an intermediate risk of bias.7 Other reviews, based largely on
the same data, found no differences in 5-year recurrence
between high ligation and saphenous stripping, RFA,
and EVLA.37 Overall, contemporary high ligation and
stripping, performed under tumescent anesthesia, had
excellent mid- and long-term results in multiple randomized studies,6-11 and the committee strongly recommends high ligation and saphenous stripping, if the
technology or expertise is not available for an endovascular procedure or the anatomy favors surgery for patients
who are appropriate candidates for intervention.

2.4.1. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the GSV who place a high priority
on the long-term outcomes of treatment (QoL and
recurrence), we
