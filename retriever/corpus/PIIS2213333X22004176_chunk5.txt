ibial, deep femoral,
and perforating veins. A minimum value >1 second
of reversed ﬂow is diagnostic of reﬂux in the common femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins.
1.1.b. Axial reﬂux is deﬁned as uninterrupted retrograde
venous ﬂow from the groin to the calf. Retrograde
ﬂow can occur in the superﬁcial or deep veins,
with or without perforating veins. Junctional reﬂux
will be limited to the saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal junction. Segmental reﬂux occurs in a
portion of a superﬁcial or deep truncal vein.
1.1.c. A deﬁnition of “pathologic” perforating veins in patients with varicose veins (CEAP [Clinical Class, Etiology, Anatomy, Pathology] clinical class C2) includes
those with an outward ﬂow duration of $500 ms
and a diameter of $3.5 mm on duplex ultrasound.
1.2.1. We recommend that evaluation of reﬂux with
duplex ultrasound be performed in an Intersocietal
Accreditation Commissione or American College of

Radiologyeaccredited vascular laboratory by a
credentialed ultrasonographer, with the patient
standing whenever possible. A sitting or reverse Trendelenburg position can be used if the patient cannot
stand.
Level of recommendation: ungraded good practice statement
1.2.2. We recommend that for evaluation of reﬂux with
duplex ultrasound, we use either a Valsalva maneuver or distal augmentation to assess the common
femoral vein and saphenofemoral junction and
distal augmentation with either manual compression or cuff deﬂation for evaluation of more distal
segments. Superﬁcial reﬂux must be traced to its
source, including the saphenous junctions, truncal
or perforating veins, or pelvic origin varicose veins.
The study should be interpreted by a physician
trained in venous duplex ultrasound interpretation.
Level of recommendation: ungraded good practice statement
1.3.1. We recommend that a complete duplex ultrasound
scanning examination for venous reﬂux in the lower
extremities should include transverse grayscale images without and with transducer compression
