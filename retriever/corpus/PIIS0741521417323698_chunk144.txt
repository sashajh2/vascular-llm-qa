We suggest antibiotic prophylaxis before respiratory tract
procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures,
and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures for any
patient with an aortic prosthesis if the potential for infection
exists or the patient is immunocompromised.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

After aneurysm repair, we recommend prompt evaluation for
possible graft infection if a patient presents with generalized
sepsis, groin drainage, pseudoaneurysm formation, or illdeﬁned pain.
Level of recommendation

Quality of evidence

We recommend prompt evaluation for possible aortoenteric
ﬁstula in a patient presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding
after aneurysm repair.
Level of recommendation

1 (Strong)

Quality of evidence

A (High)

In patients presenting with an infected graft in the presence of
extensive contamination with gross purulence, we
recommend extra-anatomic reconstruction followed by
excision of all graft material along with aortic stump closure
covered by an omental ﬂap.
Level of recommendation

1 (Strong)

Quality of evidence

B (Moderate)

In patients presenting with an infected graft with minimal
contamination, we suggest in situ reconstruction with
cryopreserved allograft.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

B (Moderate)

In a stable patient presenting with an infected graft, we
suggest in situ reconstruction with femoral vein after graft
excision and débridement.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

B (Moderate)

In unstable patients with infected graft, we recommend in
situ reconstruction with a silver- or antibiotic-impregnated
graft, cryopreserved allograft, or PTFE graft.
