We suggest a retroperitoneal exposure or a transperitoneal approach with a transverse abdominal incision for
patients with signiﬁcant pulmonary disease requiring
OSR.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

We recommend a thrombin inhibitor, such as bivalirudin or argatroban, as an alternative to heparin for patients
with
a
history
of
heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia.
Level of recommendation

1 (Strong)

Quality of evidence

B (Moderate)

We suggest concomitant surgical repair of an AAA and
coexistent cholecystitis or an intra-abdominal tumor in
patients who are not candidates for EVAR or staged
intervention.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

Quality of evidence

C (Low)

Perioperative outcomes of open AAA repair. We suggest that elective OSR for AAA be performed at centers
with an annual volume of at least 10 open aortic operations of any type and a documented perioperative mortality of 5% or less.
Level of recommendation

2 (Weak)

We recommend straight tube grafts for OSR of AAA in
the absence of signiﬁcant disease of the iliac arteries.

The patient with a ruptured aneurysm. We suggest a
door-to-intervention time of <90 minutes, based on a
framework of 30-30-30 minutes, for the management of
the patient with a ruptured aneurysm.

We recommend performing the proximal aortic anastomosis as close to the renal arteries as possible.

We recommend that all portions of an aortic graft be
excluded from direct contact with the intestinal contents of the peritoneal cavity.

We recommend reimplantation of a patent IMA under
circumstances that suggest an increased risk of colonic
ischemia.
