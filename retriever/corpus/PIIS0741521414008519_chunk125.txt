atic drainage for
healing of the chronic venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]

42S O’Donnell et al

Massage of the leg to improve lymphatic drainage is
well established as an effective therapy in patients with lymphedema. Manual lymphatic drainage increases the transport capacity of the lymphatics, stimulates development
of lymphatic collaterals, and softens ﬁbrotic tissue. This is
suggested as a good adjunctive treatment in some resistant
ulcers associated with venolymphatic edema, but there is
no formal supporting evidence.495 One RCT showed that
lymph drainage improved the mobility of the ankle joint
affected by dermatoﬁbrosis in patients with chronic ulcerated
lesions but did not show beneﬁt in ulcer healing.496
Guideline 7.5: Balneotherapy
We suggest balneotherapy to improve skin trophic changes and quality of life in patients with
advanced venous disease. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL
OF EVIDENCE - B]
Balneotherapy, spa therapy, or thermalism was studied
in some European centers that specialize in the treatment
of CVD.497 This complex therapy might beneﬁt patients
with VLUs because of mobilization of ﬂuids and decrease
of edema; improvement of venous hemodynamic, microcirculation, and skin oxygenation; and increase in circulatory
treatment velocity. The efﬁcacy of hydromassage therapy
with thermal water has been demonstrated in patients
with varicose veins. The beneﬁcial results were attributed
to the favorable action of hydrostatic pressure, which stimulated venous ﬂow, as well as to the characteristics of the
thermal water used in this study.498 Another trial also
concluded that hydrotherapy may help patients suffering
from primary varicose veins.499 An RCT showed that spa
therapy, associated with balneotherapy and patient education, signiﬁcantly and durably improved trophic skin
changes, quality of life, and symptoms in patients with
CVD but did not ﬁnd a difference in VLU
recurrences.497
