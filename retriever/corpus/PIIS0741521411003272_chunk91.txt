 al271 performed an RCT comparing EVLA
with surgery for treatment of primary varicosity and saphenous incompetence. EVLA and surgery were comparable in
ablation of reflux and in disease-specific QOL, but return to
normal activity averaged a median of 2 days (range, 0-7
days) after EVLA vs 7 days (range, 2-26 days) after surgical
treatment (P ⫽ .001). Return to work was 4 days (range,
2-7 days) after EVLA vs 17 days (range, 7.25-33.25 days)
after surgery (P ⫽ .005), suggesting important socioeconomic advantages for EVLA. These RCTs177,271 both
found a tendency toward less bruising and pain with EVLA
than with surgery.
In a single-center RCT, de Medeiros and Luccas272
compared EVLA using an 810-nm laser with stripping in
20 patients who had bilateral saphenous incompetence.
Each patient served as his or her own control. There was
significantly less edema and bruising early after the laser
procedure, but at 2 years, no difference was noted in
esthetic results, patient satisfaction, or pain, and the authors
concluded that midterm results of laser were comparable to
surgery.
Vuylsteke et al273 randomized 164 patients to EVLA
(80 patients) or HL/S (84 patients). Patient follow-up
lasted an average of 9 months after surgery. The study
found shorter duration of postoperative disability after
EVLA than after surgical treatment (8.6 vs 22.4 days; P ⬍
.05).
Kalteis et al274 reported results of a single-center RCT
comparing laser ablation (810-nm laser) with stripping of
the GSV in 100 patients, including high ligation and phlebectomies performed in both groups. Follow-up was 4
months. Fewer postoperative hematomas occurred in the
laser group, but pain and sick leave time after EVLA were
longer than after surgery (20 days vs 14 days
