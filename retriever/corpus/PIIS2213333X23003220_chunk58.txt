��ve RCTs, MPFF improved ulcer healing.15,114 The
main MPFF component, diosmin, is effective alone,
although its efﬁcacy is signiﬁcantly less than that of
MPFF.112,115
Five unblinded open-label clinical trials were included
in a systematic review investigating the effects of VADs
on recovery after surgery, endovenous ablation, or sclerotherapy20 (Table VIII). All used MPFF; in one study, sulodexide was also given. Three studies reported
signiﬁcantly less postprocedural pain, one observed no
signiﬁcant effect. Two studies reported signiﬁcant reduction in postprocedural bleeding. Three studies reported
greater symptomatic improvement with MPFF treatment. Based on these results, MPFF may help to reduce
postprocedural pain, hemorrhage, and CVD-speciﬁc
symptoms. These beneﬁts appear to be greater when
treatment is started 2 weeks before the procedure.
When VAD treatment was started only after varicose
veins surgery,117 no beneﬁt was noted.
In a nonrandomized, controlled multicenter prospective study (DEFANCE trial),118 245 C2 patients underwent
HL&S combined with stab avulsion. Patients in one group
(n ¼ 200) received 1000 mg of MPFF daily, the control
group (n ¼ 45) had no drug treatment. Compression
(class 2) was prescribed for 4 weeks after surgery for all
patients. Hematoma (P < .05) and pain (VAS) (P < .05)
were signiﬁcantly lower in the MPFF group. The same results were observed for leg heaviness and fatigue. As discussed, however, compression for 1 week after
endothermal treatment has also been useful for pain
reduction, without MPFF treatment.
Clinical beneﬁt of ruscus extracts.
Rationale. Ruscus extracts increase capillary resistance
and reduce capillary ﬁltration.119
