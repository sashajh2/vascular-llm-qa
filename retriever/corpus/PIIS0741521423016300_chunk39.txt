21%), 11% (95% CI 6 e
18%), and 38% (95% CI 21 e 58%), for WIfI clinical stages
1e4, respectively.85 For the population of people with a
DFU, the WIfI system was evaluated in the IWGDF systematic review on classiﬁcation systems, that is published in parallel to this guideline. In summary, in
people with diabetes, PAD, and a foot ulcer, this systematic review identiﬁed seven studies, with low certainty of
evidence, demonstrating that a high WIfI limb clinical
stage
is
associated
with
longer
time
to
healing and increased likelihood of non-healing at six
and 12 months.86e92 Higher WIfI clinical stages are also
associated with increased likelihood of major amputation, with one study reporting an amputation rate of
64% for stage 4.93 Similarly, higher WIfI clinical stages
have been linked to high rates of minor amputation
and lower rates of amputation free survival at 12
months.88,89,92,94e99 For prediction of revascularisation
beneﬁt there are few data available and inadequate evidence to determine whether WIfI revascularisation
beneﬁt staging predicts healing or amputation outcomes in people undergoing revascularisation.
The WIfI tool (Tables 1e5) has demonstrated predictive
capacity for the key outcomes of wound healing and
amputation in people with DFU.88,89,92,94e99 It uses clinical grading of infection and wound characteristics in
combination with non-invasive bedside testing to determine the severity of ischaemia and it has wide availability, also as an online tool (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/
svs-ipg/id1014644425). Moreover, it can be used by a wide
range of practitioners making its application in clinical
practice feasible, its costs are relatively limited, and it is
expected to be acceptable to practitioners as well as being of value to people receiving the care. It is likely to
stimulate a standardised access to a form of vascular
assessment, which is also relevant for low income countries where invasive testing may
