 femoral artery. Use of stents in the common femoral artery (CFA)
is not recommended because they are more likely to fracture or fail due to ﬂexion of the artery that occurs with
hip ﬂexion. If disease extends into the CFA, the use of a
hybrid approach combining femoral endarterectomy with
iliac stenting is a better alternative in most patients.
Covered stents have been used in the treatment of iliac
occlusive disease. Covered balloon-expandable stents had better primary patency rates when used in more complex lesions
in the iliac artery.141 In the prospective, randomized Covered
vs Balloon Expandable Stent Trial,141 covered balloonexpandable stents demonstrated better primary patency rates
than bare-metal stents (BMSs) in AIOD, particularly in the
more advanced lesions. However, in a more recent singlecenter, retrospective study, BMSs had superior patency to
covered stents at 1 year.158 Regardless of any potential patency
advantages, covered stents may provide a safety margin in the
treatment of calciﬁed common iliac lesions or ectatic vessels
where rupture is a distinct possibility. For the external iliac artery, ﬂexible, self-expanding stents are recommended because
of the motion these vessels undergo and the potential for kinking and crimping of balloon-expandable stents placed in this
location. Similarly, covered versions of these stents have also
been used in the external iliac artery, although speciﬁc indications favoring one vs the other are not clear.
Initial technical success for iliac stenting varies from 90%
to 100% and depends on the extent of the disease, with
more complex lesions having lower initial technical success
rates. Long-segment occlusion of the external iliac artery,
particularly in women or patients with smaller vessels or
circumferential calciﬁcation, or both, remains an important
