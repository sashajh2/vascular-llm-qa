10 TEVARs within the last 2 years or less
than this minimum for surgeons with a robust EVAR
experience, deﬁned as 25 EVARs with 12 as the primary
operator. Trainees should also be able to manage complex aortic patients as well as to perform adjunctive procedures, including iliac conduits and carotid-subclavian
bypass grafting.
The relationship between volume and outcomes has
been explored for TEVAR,218-220 and the data supporting
or refuting such a relationship are poor, mainly because
these studies are typically underpowered and the data
are heterogeneous, including EVAR and TEVAR, or
TEVAR when used to treat multiple pathologic processes
(ie, aneurysm and dissection). One study using the Medicare claims database from 1999 to 2007 documented a
mortality rate for TEVAR in low-volume centers of 9%
to 10%, whereas mortality was 7% in high-volume TEVAR
centers. Despite these gross mortality differences, a
multivariable model for mortality failed to show volume
as a predictor (P ¼ .328).218 A second study using Medicare Provider and Analysis Review data also found no association between TEVAR volume and mortality.219
Finally, a study using a Medicare Provider and Analysis
Review data set in 10,000 patients undergoing TEVAR
found no clear relationship between hospital volume

effect and survival. However, these same practitioners
suggested that using a mixed effects Cox model demonstrated an “independent hospital effect” associated with
certain hospitals, with a death 50% of what occurred at
other hospitals.220 These data suggest that at present,
no clear conclusion can be drawn between hospital volume and outcomes after TEVAR. Importantly, even fewer
data are available to examine the role of individual clinician TEVAR volume and outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS
TEVAR is used to treat a myriad of aortic diseases.
Whereas there are no randomized, controlled trials
comparing open and endovascular DTA repair directly
and probably never will be, consensus documents, large
administrative data sets, and meta-analyses
