 colleagues analyzed a 15-year
experience in which anastomoses at the femoral artery
were at highest risk (3%), followed by the iliac artery
(1.2%) and infrarenal aorta (0.2%).734 Subsequent studies
have reported an incidence after open repair of between
4% and 10% at 10-year follow-up.732 In one study of 511
patients, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a probability of
para-anastomotic aneurysm of 0.8% at 5 years, 6.2% at 10
years, and 35.8% at 15 years.733 This observation has been
conﬁrmed by others, particularly the risk of femoral
pseudoaneurysm formation among patients treated
with an aortobifemoral graft.732,735 Indolent graft infection should be suspected in all pseudoaneurysms.
Given the inability to precisely differentiate anastomotic disruption from degenerative aneurysmal dilation,
indications for repair of para-anastomotic aneurysms are
not well deﬁned. Clearly, large size and rapid enlargement are indications for intervention. Redo open repair
carries a signiﬁcant risk of major morbidity and mortality,
and endovascular repair, where anatomically feasible,
provides a minimally invasive option.736,737 Infrarenal
and fenestrated endografts have been used with chimney as well as snorkeling techniques.738-742
Recommendation for postoperative surveillance
Systematic reviews by the Society for Vascular Surgery
showed a signiﬁcant incidence of postoperative endoleaks up to 5 years after EVAR, which provides rationale
for surveillance. The evidence was insufﬁcient to recommend an optimal frequency of surveillance. Magnetic
resonance imaging was more sensitive than CT angiography and contrast-enhanced CT, although the difference
was small. Duplex ultrasound was inferior to CT and
contrast-enhanced ultrasound in terms of detection rate,
although leaks missed on ultrasound did not require intervention or were not considered to be clinically signiﬁcant.

The goal of postoperative surveillance is to prevent late
rupture and aneurysm-related death.
