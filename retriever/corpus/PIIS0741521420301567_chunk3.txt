Technical remark: Non-contrast-enhanced MRA is best
suited to children and women of childbearing potential
or those who have contraindications to CTA or MRA
contrast materials (ie, pregnancy, renal insufﬁciency, or
gadolinium contrast material allergy).
1.3: We recommend the use of catheter-based angiography both for preoperative planning and to better delineate distal renal artery branches that may be
inadequately assessed on conventional cross-sectional
imaging. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
2.1: In patients with noncomplicated RAA of acceptable
operative risk, we suggest treatment for aneurysm size
>3 cm. Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
2.2: We recommend emergent intervention for any size
RAA resulting in patient symptoms or rupture. Level of
recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of
Evidence: B (Moderate).
2.3: In patients of childbearing potential with noncomplicated RAA of acceptable operative risk, we suggest
treatment regardless of size. Level of recommendation:
Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
2.4: In patients with medically refractory hypertension
and functionally important renal artery stenosis, we suggest treatment regardless of size. Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
3.1: We suggest daily antiplatelet therapy (ie, aspirin,
81 mg) for patients with RAA. Level of recommendation:
Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: C (Low).
3.2: We suggest open surgical reconstructive techniques for the elective repair of most RAAs in patients
with acceptable operative risk. Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate
