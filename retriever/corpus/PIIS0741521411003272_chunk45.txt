Safety
The safety of any procedure used for treatment of
varicose veins or more advanced CVD needs to be established, and the procedurally related early adverse effects
(‚¨ç30 days) and late complications should be documented.
Table V defines minor and major complications for reporting purposes.124

Most patients who seek treatment for varicose veins
have symptoms of aching, throbbing, feeling of a heavy leg,
fatigue, cramps, pruritus, restless leg, ankle swelling, and
tenderness or pain along bulging varicose veins. Some will
have history of thrombophlebitis or bleeding from superficial varicose veins or have signs of more advanced CVD,
such as edema, skin changes, including lipodermatosclerosis, eczema, pigmentation, atrophie blanche, corona phlebectatica, and healed or active ulceration. Less frequently,
the veins are of cosmetic concern only.
Medical treatment
Venoactive drugs have been available for treatment of
symptoms of varicose veins and more advanced forms of
CVD for decades, and they have also been used to decrease
ankle swelling and accelerate ulcer healing.128 Many compounds have been tried with varying success, but the most
promising drugs include saponins, such as the horse chestnut seed extract (aescin)129; gamma-benzopyrenes (flavonoids), such as rutosides, diosmin, and hesperidin; the
micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF),130 and
other plant extracts such as French maritime pine bark
extract. Synthetic products include calcium dobesilate, naftazone, and benzarone.131
The principle for the use of venoactive drugs has been
to improve venous tone and capillary permeability, although a precise mechanism of action of most of these
drugs is unknown. Flavonoids appear to affect leukocytes
and the endothelium by modifying the degree of inflammation and reducing edema.56
A recent Cochrane review of 110 publications selected
44 well-documented studies for analysis.132 The metaanalysis found that there appeared to be an effect on edema
and on restless leg syndrome. Diosmin, hes
