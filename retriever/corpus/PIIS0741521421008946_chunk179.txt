mortality was signiﬁcantly higher when practitioners performed fewer than six CAS procedures per year,
compared with more than 24 (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.7;
P < .001). Setacci et al585 reported data from a large
single-center series involving 2124 CAS procedures and
showed that a lifetime experience of more than 100
CAS procedures was associated with signiﬁcantly fewer
perioperative strokes (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.7-0.95), whereas
a lifetime experience of fewer than 50 CAS procedures
was a signiﬁcant predictor of increased risk of perioperative stroke (P < .001).
As noted elsewhere in this article, Calvet et al576
concluded that CAS practitioners should be performing
at least six CAS procedures each year. The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions and the Society for Vascular Medicine both advise that in the setting
of low CAS volumes, 25 lifetime CAS procedures is
reasonable to achieve competence, along with annual
10 to 15 CAS procedures to maintain competency.586
These numbers assume that 3% asymptomatic and 6%
for symptomatic thresholds are maintained.

CAS provider specialty
The CREST study noted no differences in outcome for
CAS based on operator specialty.5 The CAPTURE 2 study
noted that patients of interventional cardiologists
tended to have a lower 30-day stroke/death risk than
those of other specialties, but the difference was not statistically signiﬁcant.577 The CHOICE study, which

separated specialties into surgery, radiology/neurology,
and cardiology,580 demonstrated that cardiologists had
reduced EPD dwell times (the time during which the cerebral protection devices were deployed in place),
compared with surgery and radiology/neurology. However, the 30-day stroke/death/MI risk did not differ among
the three specialties. Similarly, the CAPTURE study found
no difference in 30-day stroke/death/MI based on specialty
