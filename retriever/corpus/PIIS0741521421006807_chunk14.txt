ﬁed by the severity of
ALI at presentation. We recommend that patients with mild to moderate ALI (Rutherford grade I and IIa) and severely obstructed
tibiopedal arteries undergo thrombolysis or pharmacomechanical intervention to improve runoff status, with prompt transition to
deﬁnitive PAA repair. We recommend that patients with severe ALI (Rutherford grade IIb) should undergo prompt surgical or
endovascular PAA repair, with the use of adjunctive surgical thromboembolectomy or pharmacomechanical intervention to maximize
tibiopedal outﬂow. Nonviable limbs (Rutherford grade III) require amputation (grade 1B)

2002

12 Patients with ALI,
Rutherford grade IIa; 1 with
ALI, Rutherford grade IIb

All patients received
preoperative
thrombolysis

Thrombolysis failures (3/13) predicted
for bypass failure and AKA;
thrombolysis for ALI IIb resulted in
rhabdomyolysis and death

Retrospective study;
moderate
methodologic quality

Pulli et al,41 2006

17 Patients with ALI,
Rutherford grade I-IIa; 19
with ALI, Rutherford grade
IIb

11/17 Thrombolysis patients (64.5%) had
17 Patients with
Rutherford grade I-IIa restoration of patency of PAA and $1
tibial vessel
received preoperative
lysis; 19 with
Rutherford grade IIb
underwent open
repair

Retrospective study;
moderate
methodologic quality

Kropman et al,23
2010

895 Patients with ALI (122
with Rutherford grade
noted: 101, IIa; 18, IIb; 3, III)

313, Lysis (255
preoperatively); 551,
OPAR; 31, primary
amputation

Pre- and intraoperative thrombolysis
plus bypass yielded improved graft
patency rates at 1 year but no change
in amputation rates compared with
surgical thrombectomy plus bypass
