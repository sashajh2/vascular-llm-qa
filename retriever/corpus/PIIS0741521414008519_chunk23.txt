C5)
and in 0.1% with an open VLU for a total of 0.7%. This
longitudinal study documented a decrease in advanced
CVI (C4-C6), which may be related to a more comprehensive use of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for
CVI. Because of the high prevalence of venous disease, the
AVF National Venous Screening Program was established
in the United States to increase awareness. The program
screened 2234 individuals and identiﬁed varicose veins in
more than 30% of participants and more advanced venous
disease (C4-C6) in more than 10%.10 It has been estimated
that approximately 2.5 million people suffer from CVI in
the United States, and of those, about 20% develop venous
ulcers.11
Economic Impact. The overall cost of treating VLU
approaches 1% of the health care budget of some western
European countries; in the United Kingdom, the annual
cost is estimated to range from ₤300 million to ₤600

million per year.12,13 In the United States, $2.5 billion
was expended for the treatment of VLUs in more than 6
million patients.14 A recent study on the cost of treating
VLUs in Germany demonstrated that mean cost averaged
V9569 per patient per year, and 92% of this expenditure
was related to direct costs.15 Although the majority of
patients with VLUs can be treated on an outpatient basis
and are infrequently hospitalized except for complications,
the direct cost of treating VLUs in the United States has
been estimated to be $2500 per month per patient.16 In
the ambulatory setting, the direct cost of this care is related
to (1) technical (facility) costs and professional reimbursement (physicians); (2) labor costs (nurses and paramedical personnel) for wound care treatments, which are
the major driver of costs; and (3) medications as well as
specialized wound dressings and compression garments. A
key determinant of the costs of treating VLU is the effectiveness of treatmentdnot only how rapidly the ulcer heals,
but
