aneurysm size and among current smokers was lower
in those with low ABI and diabetes and was unaffected
by lipids and blood pressure.272 Combining the results
of 18 surveillance studies with similar imaging and
assessment protocols, the RESCAN collaborators identiﬁed a pooled growth rate across all studies of 2.2 mm/y,
with no signiﬁcant difference between men and
women. When estimates were pooled using randomeffects meta-analysis, following further adjustment for
all demographics and medical and drug history, rates
of aneurysm enlargement were signiﬁcantly increased
in smokers and decreased in those with diabetes
(Fig 2). Pooled meta-analysis failed to identify the
effects of any class of drug on aneurysm expansion.9
After adjustment for initial aneurysm diameter, medical
history, and demographics, a strong association was
noted between smoking and rupture (hazard ratio,
2.02; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 1.33-3.06; P ¼ .001)
and a far higher risk for women than for men (hazard
ratio, 3.76; 95% CI, 2.58-5.47; P < .001). Rupture risk
was increased in older participants, those enrolled in
earlier studies, those with lower
