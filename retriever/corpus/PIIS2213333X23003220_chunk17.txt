 patients with varicose veins (CEAP class C2) who have signiﬁcant, symptomatic axial
reﬂux of the GSV or SSV, we recommend against treatment of incompetent perforating
veins concomitant with initial ablation of the saphenous veins.

10.1.2. For patients with varicose veins (CEAP class C2) who have signiﬁcant, symptomatic axial
reﬂux of the AAGSV or PAGSV, we suggest against treatment of incompetent perforating
veins concomitant with initial ablation of the superﬁcial truncal veins.

Consensus statement
10.2.

For patients with incompetent pathologic perforators associated with symptomatic residual, recurrent, and rarely primary
varicosities, without associated saphenous incompetence, either open or endovascular techniques can be used to treat the
perforator veins.

Guideline
11.1.1.

Grade of
recommendation

In an average-risk patient who is asymptomatic following thermal ablation of the
1 (strong)
saphenous vein, we recommend against routine early postprocedural DUS to detect ARTE
(ARTE, formerly known as endovenous heat-induced thrombosis [EHIT]) or DVT.

Quality of
Evidence
B
(moderate)

Consensus statement
11.1.2.

In an average-risk patients who is asymptomatic following nonthermal ablation of the saphenous vein, routine early
postprocedural DUS may be performed to detect ARTE or DVT.
