 patients on statins and 15% among
those not on statins at the time of the CAS (odds ratio
[OR], 0.23; 95% CI, 0.005-0.99; P ¼ .049).94 This ﬁnding
was conﬁrmed in a study of 344 consecutive patients
who underwent CAS from 2002 to 2012. Statins were
associated with a periprocedural risk reduction in the
incidence of ischemic stroke, MI, or death (OR, 0.31;
95% CI, 0.3-0.71; P ¼ .006).95 The largest case series reported to date includes 1083 patients who underwent
CAS from 2004 to 2009. In these patients, statin use
was associated with reduced perioperative stroke and
death (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13-0.80; P ¼ .016), and the
impact of statins was more pronounced in reducing
stroke and death in symptomatic patients (OR, 0.13; P¼
.032) and in males (OR, 0.27; P ¼ .01).96
In addition, several studies have demonstrated regression in intima-media thickness in the carotid artery
among statin users compared with controls.97-99 Very
recent MRI data from the population-based Rotterdam
Study showed that among 1740 participants with carotid
atherosclerosis and a mean age of 72.9 years, statin use
was associated with a change in carotid plaque composition from vulnerable plaque with a lipid core to more
stable calciﬁed plaque.100 However, there is no compelling evidence that statin therapy is associated with clinically signiﬁcant carotid plaque regression.
When combined with lifestyle and dietary changes,
statin therapy is the most effective pharmacologic therapy for lipid-lowering.101 High intensity statin therapy includes daily atorvastatin 40 to 80 mg or rosuvastatin 20
to 40 mg.
