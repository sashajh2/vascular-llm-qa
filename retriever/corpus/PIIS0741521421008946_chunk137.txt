plaque from the carotid bifurcation has been hypothesized to impair normal baroreceptor mechanisms. Reﬂex hypotension following endarterectomy can persist
until the carotid sinus mechanisms has readjusted.
CEA can result in direct surgical damage to the baroreceptor nerves located at the carotid bifurcation323,430 or
to the compensatory restoration of the baroreﬂex
mechanism caused by removal of the bifurcation plaque.323,430,431 Signiﬁcant hypotension can result in postoperative global cerebral ischemia in predisposed
patients. A recent meta-analysis found that post-CEA
hypertension requiring vasodilator therapy was 53.8%

and
40.3%

endarterectomy.323
Postoperative hypertension is closely related to presence of preoperative hypertension, but its mechanism
following CEA is not well-characterized. Signiﬁcant postoperative hypertension can increase risk of other postCEA complications, including myocardial ischemia, ICH,
and wound hematoma.432 Appropriate management of
both postoperative hypertension and hypotension can
help decrease the incidence of other associated postoperative morbidities.
To appropriately treat hemodynamic instability after
CEA, patient observation in a monitored unit with either
an indwelling radial artery catheter of systemic blood
pressure monitoring is generally recommended in the
initial postoperative period.417 Hypotension should be
treated initially with ﬂuid administration to achieve a
euvolemic state. If hypotension persists without other hemodynamic causes, blood pressure support with an
intravenous infusion of phenylephrine is generally recommended.417 Vasoconstrictors can typically be weaned
within 24 hours after surgery.
Postoperative hypertension is
