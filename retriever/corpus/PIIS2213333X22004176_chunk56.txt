LA or RFA), were reported by
Vahaaho et al.191 A total of 117 patients were treated,
and the occlusion rate at 3 years was signiﬁcantly lower
with MOCA than with either EVLA or RFA (82% vs
100%; P ¼ .005). A GSV >7 mm in diameter had had an
increased recanalization rate after MOCA.
In another study, EVLA was associated with a lower
recurrent varicosity scale score than UGFS using
physician-compounded foam, and RFA was associated
with a lower risk of reintervention compared with UGFS

RFA of GSV
(n ¼ 114)

CAC of GSV
(n ¼ 108)

No difference in
intraprocedural and
24-hour pain scores;
more ecchymosis after
RFA (P < .01); at
1 month, 100%
occlusion after CAC
and 87% occlusion
after RFA; at 1 year, no
difference in
occlusion,
recanalization,
symptoms, or QoL
