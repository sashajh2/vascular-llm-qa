Summary of evidence: Interventions for aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD)

Clinical question
The effect of endovascular
vs open surgery for AIOD
on the outcomes of mortality,
complications, and patency
The effect of PTA vs stent
placement for AIOD on
the outcomes of mortality,
complications, and patency

The effect of endovascular
vs open surgery for extensive
AIOD on the outcomes of
mortality, complications, and
patency
