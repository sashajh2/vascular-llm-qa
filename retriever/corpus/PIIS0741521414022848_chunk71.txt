PTA (74.8% vs 26.5%) and BMS (83.4% vs 64.1%) was sustained in a 2-year follow-up report of the same study.212
PTFE-covered self-expanding stents have been used to
treat long-segment lesions within the SFA for patients
with claudication, although their superiority to BMSs is
as yet unproven. The Viabahn Endoprosthesis with
PROPATEN Bioactive Surface (VIA) vs Bare Nitinol
Stent in the Treatment of Long Lesions in Superﬁcial
Femoral Artery Occlusive Disease (VIASTAR) prospective
multicenter trial213 compared BMSs with heparin-bonded
PTFE covered stents in the treatment of long-segment
SFA stenosis and found no statistically signiﬁcant difference in 1-year primary patency by intention-to-treat analysis, although in the treatment per protocol cohort and in
those with lesions >20 cm, patency was superior in the
PTFE group. This study was ﬂawed by protocol violations
in >8% of cases.

The Viabahn vs Bare Nitinol Stent in the Treatment of
Long Lesion Superﬁcial Femoral Artery Occlusive Disease
(VIBRANT) trial randomized 148 patients to PTFE
covered or nitinol BMSs for lesions averaging 18 cm in
length. At 3 years, primary patency was nearly identical
(24.2% vs 25.9%).196 Some authors have raised caution
about the failure mode of covered stents in FPOD, with
a higher proportion of acute limb ischemia events
compared with BMS, particularly when distal collateral vessels are covered.214 Covered stents may have a role in the
treatment of diffuse in-stent restenosis in the SFA.215 At
the present time, given the increased cost and lack of clinical superiority over BMSs, a primary role for covered stents
in the treatment of IC due to FPOD
