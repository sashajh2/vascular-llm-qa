.70 Others,
however, found that ablation of small (<5 mm)
symptomatic GSVs provided clinical success in 83% of
the limbs at 3 months, with signiﬁcant improvement
in the venous clinical severity score (VCSS; median
change, 2; interquartile range, 3 to 1).64
A retrospective study of 728 limbs of 531 patients with
CVD found a positive correlation between the vein diameter and reﬂux duration measured using DU and CEAP
clinical class, VCSS, and HASTI (heaviness, achiness,
swelling, throbbing, itching) score.75 Several other studies
have provided evidence that the superﬁcial vein diameters correlate with the CEAP class and severity of CVD.71-73
In a prospective observational study of 330 patients with
symptomatic varicose vein, the vein diameter had a significant association with the VCSS (P ¼ .041); however, no other
QoL or symptom measures were related to the vein
diameter.76 Mendoza et al71 found that measurements at
the proximal thigh, 15 cm distal to the groin, correlated
better with reﬂux and were more sensitive and speciﬁc
than were measurements at the SFJ. In a study of 152
patients with varicose veins, a GSV diameter of 5.880 mm
measured 5 cm distal to the SFJ using computed tomography with the patient in the supine position was the cutoff
value for the prediction of reﬂux (sensitivity, 91.4%; speciﬁcity, 81.8%).77 The investigators concluded, however, that
the vein diameter alone should not be used as an absolute
reference for venous reﬂux.

A high level of evidence on treatment decisions made using the vein diameter alone, however, is still lacking.
Analyzing the data from 242 patients who had participated
in a RCT, Attaran et al68 recently reported a poor correlation
between the GSV diameter and baseline VCSS (R ¼ 0.004;
P ¼ .95) and between the GSV diameter
