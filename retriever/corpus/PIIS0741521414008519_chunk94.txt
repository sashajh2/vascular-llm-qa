 was no signiﬁcant difference between the ulcer healing rates after 3 months (33 of 53 ¼ 62% healed
with 4LB vs 43 of 59 ¼ 73% with SSB).297-299 Studies
comparing different versions of the 4LB (proprietary and
nonproprietary) were similar in outcomes, and thus a speciﬁc 4LB is not endorsed.300-302
On the basis of our commissioned comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of compression modalities
and venous ulcer healing, moderate-quality evidence supports multicomponent compression over single component
compression.30
Guideline 5.4: CompressiondArterial Insufﬁciency
In a patient with a venous leg ulcer and underlying
arterial disease, we do not suggest compression bandages or stockings if the ankle-brachial index is 0.5 or
less or if absolute ankle pressure is less than 60 mm
Hg. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
An ABI of less than 0.5 is considered to be indicative
of severe arterial disease.303 Compression of a limb with

signiﬁcant arterial disease could compromise arterial
perfusion and potentially result in adverse ischemic
sequelae. In a survey study, nearly one third of general
surgery consultants surveyed reported that they had
encountered ulcers or necrosis as the direct result of
compression treatment.304 Supporting evidence is limited
to a small number of case reports and a dated physiology
study that examined the effects of compression on the upper extremity in healthy subjects.305-307 However, one
study using magnetic resonance ﬂowmetry showed that
sustained compression with a pressure around 40 mm
Hg increases the arterial ﬂow under the bandage in
normal volunteers.308 Similarly, a recent study performed
in patients with VLUs and concomitant arterial occlusive
disease (ABI of 0.5 to 0.85) demonstrated by multiple
metrics that arterial blood ﬂow is even augmented by inelastic bandages.309
