.315-319 The rate of renal dysfunction appears to
be equivalent for endografts that use nitinol or stainless
steel transrenal stents and not signiﬁcantly different
from that observed with infrarenal ﬁxation.318 Although
suprarenal ﬁxation may produce a higher incidence of
small renal infarcts, these do not appear to be clinically
signiﬁcant in most patients. Renal dysfunction after
EVAR with suprarenal ﬁxation is likely to be multifactorial and transient in most patients.320 Nonetheless,
renal artery occlusion and infarctions have been reported in patients with pre-existing renal artery occlusive disease, and although infrequent, visceral
dysfunction and celiac or mesenteric artery occlusion
may occur secondary to suprarenal ﬁxation.321-324 One
report showed no difference in renal function between
the two device types, whereas another study demonstrated a reduction in renal function after the use of a
suprarenal ﬁxation device.325,326 A recent meta-analysis
examining the renal complications after standard
EVAR with suprarenal and infrarenal ﬁxation demonstrated no difference in renal complications.327
Management of the internal iliac artery. Exclusion of
the hypogastric artery (HA) to prevent a type II endoleak is usually required when the aneurysm involves
either the distal common iliac artery or the HA itself.328-332 Several observational studies have revealed
that unilateral embolization of the HA can be performed during EVAR with minimal adverse events as
long as the contralateral HA is patent.329,330 Although
ipsilateral buttock claudication and erectile dysfunction
have been reported to occur in up to 40% of patients
after unilateral HA embolization, these symptoms tend
to improve and abate over time.333 Indeed, one of the
largest series of patients undergoing HA interruption
during AAA repair revealed that persistent buttock
claudication developed in 12% of unilateral and 11% of
bilateral HA interruptions, whereas impotence occurred
in 9% of unilateral and 13% of
