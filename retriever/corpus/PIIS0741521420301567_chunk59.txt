ization for gastric and gastroepiploic
artery aneurysms, even ruptured, offers >90% technical
success and low morbidity and mortality. Stent grafting
has been described but remains anecdotal.1,144
Axial imaging as recommended will screen for
concomitant nonaortic intra-abdominal arterial aneurysms, which are common.136,139,145

Recommendation
2.1

We recommend treatment of all gastric artery and gastroepiploic artery
aneurysms of any size.

Gastric artery aneurysms are 10 times more common
than gastroepiploic artery aneurysms. Although patients
may present with abdominal pain, up to 90% of patients
have historically presented acutely ruptured, with evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding more common than
intraperitoneal rupture (1/3).87,111 Treatment is recommended for all gastric and gastroepiploic artery aneurysms,
regardless of size, in light of this rupture risk at relatively
small aneurysm sizes.139

Quality of
evidence
B (Moderate)

We recommend screening for cerebrovascular and coronary artery aneurysm when the diagnosis of segmental
arterial mediolysis is suspected, given the systemic nature of this arterial dysplasia, with one-time screening
CTA or MRA of the head, neck, and chest.136,146
We recommend routine interval surveillance (ie, every
12 months) with axial imaging (ie, CTA or MRA) in cases
of segmental medial arteriolysis in light of reported cases
of rapid arterial transformation.147

Recommendation
3.1

We recommend endovascular embolization for Ô¨Årst-line treatment of gastric
artery and gastroepiploic artery aneurysms

Surgical management has historically relied on simple
arterial ligation or excision without reconstruction, whereas
intramural aneur
