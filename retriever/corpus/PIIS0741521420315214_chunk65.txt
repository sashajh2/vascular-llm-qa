 have shown that the sizes of the common and
external iliac arteries remain a barrier to device delivery in
some patients. Atherosclerotic occlusive disease can be
treated with balloon angioplasty or use of the Dotter
technique with serially larger balloons and dilators to
facilitate transfemoral delivery of a device, but it should
be performed carefully with low-pressure inﬂations
starting with a small balloon to avoid iliac rupture.
Data from the early Food and Drug Administration and
prospective company-sponsored investigational device
exemption trials showed that iliac conduits were used
in 15% to 21% of patients.80,90,189 Improvement in the proﬁle and size of delivery systems has decreased this number signiﬁcantly. An industry-sponsored trial of a TEVAR
device with delivery systems that range from 16F to 20F
required an iliac conduit in only one (0.9%) patient.177
This low number was aided by strict exclusion criteria
that included iliac tortuosity, calciﬁcation, occlusive disease, and an inner wall diameter that was not adequate
for the required sheath diameter.177
A review of the National Surgical Quality Improvement
Program database showed that conduits were more
likely to be performed in women (15.7% female vs 5.8%
male; P < .001), patients who are current smokers, and
patients with a previous coronary intervention.190 The decision to use an iliac conduit should be made during the
planning phase of the case as attempts to deliver a large
device through clearly inadequate iliac vessels can lead
to prolonged operative times and increase the risk of
hemorrhage and death secondary to iliac disruption.
The anatomic factors that increase the need for conduits

include tortuous iliac arteries, heavy calciﬁcation, and
small vessel size relative to the chosen device.
An open surgical iliac conduit is usually performed with
a retroperitoneal exposure of the common iliac artery or
distal aorta through an oblique incision in the lower
quadrant of the abdomen. The choice of common iliac
artery vs the aorta should be based on CTA ﬁndings,
such as calciﬁcation and
