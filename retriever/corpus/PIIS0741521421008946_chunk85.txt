 was occluded. The study concluded that primary closure was equivalent to patch angioplasty when
used in selected patients.
Avgerinos et al303 compared perioperative and longterm outcomes of different CEA closure techniques in a
large single-center retrospective study (1737 CEA). Onehalf of the patients had patch closure, with the rest
evenly distributed between eversion closure and primary
longitudinal arteriotomy closure. Although more men
had primary closure, other demographic characteristics
and baseline symptoms were similar among groups,
and risk of stroke and death were also similar.
Patch material during CEA. CEA patch material is
also controversial with supporters for both vein patches
(saphenous or neck veins) and synthetic patches (polytetraﬂuoroethylene [PTFE], Dacron) or pericardial patches.
Data from randomized controlled trials suggest that
the type of patch, whether vein or prosthetics, has no effect on short or long-term outcomes.269,271,281,304 Bond
et al304 reported from the Cochrane Database on several
randomized clinical trials,259,260,263,274,278,281,282,305,306 but
found insufﬁcient data to enable a deﬁnitive conclusion
(Table VI) about optimal patch material because of the
small number of adverse events. In the early period, carotid patching was performed using conventional
Dacron or PTFE patches; however, a main criticism of the
conventional PTFE patch was a prolonged hemostasis
time. Thus, a modiﬁed PTFE patch was introduced
(ACUSEAL, W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz), which

claims to have better hemostatic properties. Similarly, a
new ultrathin Dacron graft patch was introduced to
minimize thrombosis (Finesse; Boston Scientiﬁc, Natick,
Mass). AbuRahma et al259,260 reported the results of a
randomized trial comparing conventional PTFE and
