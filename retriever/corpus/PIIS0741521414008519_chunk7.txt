We recommend that venous leg ulcers receive thorough débridement at their initial evaluation to remove obvious
necrotic tissue, excessive bacterial burden, and cellular burden of dead and senescent cells. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE - B] We suggest that additional maintenance débridement be performed to maintain the appearance
and readiness of the wound bed for healing. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B] We suggest that the health
care provider choose from a number of débridement methods, including sharp, enzymatic, mechanical, biologic, and
autolytic. More than one débridement method may be appropriate. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 4.3: Anesthesia for Surgical Débridement
We recommend that local anesthesia (topical or local injection) be administered to minimize discomfort associated with surgical venous leg ulcer débridement. In selected cases, regional block or general anesthesia may be
required. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 4.4: Surgical Débridement
We recommend that surgical débridement be performed for venous leg ulcers with slough, nonviable tissue, or
eschar. Serial wound assessment is important in determining the need for repeated débridement. [GRADE - 1;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 4.5 Hydrosurgical Débridement
We suggest hydrosurgical débridement as an alternative to standard surgical débridement of venous leg ulcers.
[GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 4.6: Ultrasonic Débridement
We suggest against ultrasonic débridement over surgical débridement in the treatment of venous leg ulcers.
[GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 4.7: Enzymatic Débridement
We suggest enzymatic débridement of venous leg ulcers when no clinician trained in surgical débridement is
available to débride the wound. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C] We do not suggest enzymatic débridement over surgical débridement. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 4.8: Biologic Débrid
