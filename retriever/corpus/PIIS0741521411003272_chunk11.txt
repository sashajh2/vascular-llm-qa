INTRODUCTION
In the United States, an estimated 23% of adults have
varicose veins, and 6% have more advanced chronic venous
disease (CVD), including skin changes and healed or active
venous ulcers.1 Varicose veins have long been considered a
cosmetic problem that only affected emotional well-being
but were not the source of disability. Varicosities, however,
are frequently the cause of discomfort, pain, loss of working
days, disability, and deterioration of health-related quality
of life (QOL).1-3 Severe CVD may also lead to loss of limb
or loss of life.4
Evaluation of varicose veins has greatly progressed in
the past 2 decades with the widespread availability of duplex
ultrasonography.5 The treatment of varicose veins has also
undergone dramatic changes with the introduction of percutaneous endovenous ablation techniques, including endovenous laser therapy (EVLA),6,7 radiofrequency ablation
(RFA),8 and liquid or foam sclerotherapy.9,10 Open surgical treatment with stripping of the varicose veins performed
under general anesthesia, with the associated pain, potential for wound complications, and loss of working days, has
been largely replaced by percutaneous office-based procedures that can be performed under local or tumescent
anesthesia with similar early and midterm results but with
less discomfort to the patient, improved early QOL, and
earlier return to work.11-13
The purpose of this document is to report recently
formulated current recommendations for the evaluation
and treatment of patients with varicose veins of the lower
limbs and pelvis. These Guidelines also include recommendations for management of superficial and perforating vein
incompetence in patients with associated, more advanced
CVDs, such as venous edema, skin changes, or ulcerations.
To accomplish this task, a joint Venous Guideline Committee of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and the
American Venous Forum (AVF) was established.
Under no circumstance should these Guidelines be
construed in practice or legal terms as defining the “standard of care,” which is solely determined by the condition
of the individual patient, treatment
