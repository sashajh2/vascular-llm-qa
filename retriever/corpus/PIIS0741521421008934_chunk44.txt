 artery of $125 cm/s to denote angiographic stenosis of $50%. A combination of peak systolic
velocity of 230 cm/s and an end-diastolic velocity of
$100 cm/s or a peak systolic velocity ratio between the internal and common carotid artery of $4 can be used to predict a stenosis of $70%.126 Using these criteria, the reported
sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and accuracy of duplex ultrasound in
predicting 50% to 69% or $70% stenosis were 93%, 68%,

and 85% and 99%, 86%, and 95%, respectively.125 The major
limitations of duplex ultrasound include its dependence on
a skilled operator and its inability to completely image the
proximal and intracranial vasculature. Certain anatomic
features can also reduce the accuracy of duplex ultrasound
imaging, including severe vascular calciﬁcation and arterial
tortuosity.15
At present, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) can provide three-dimensional images that can rival those of formal arteriography.75 Its
main advantages include the absence of radiation and
the avoidance of iodinated-based contrast materials.
Additionally, MRA can be combined with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, delineating clinically silent
cerebral infarction. It can also evaluate plaque
morphology, in particular, the presence of intraplaque
hemorrhage.127 Contraindications include the presence
of metallic implants, including some pacemakers and
deﬁbrillators. MRA has no role, however, in screening for
carotid artery disease, owing to its considerable expense.
Multidimensional CTA can be used to rapidly and accurately evaluate soft tissue, bone, and vascular structures
simultaneously. It is also able to evaluate the extent of vessel
calciﬁcation, especially in the aortic arch. CTA is less likely to
overestimate the severity of carotid stenosis compared
with MRA.15,75 The requirement for radiation and the use
of contrast remain its most signiﬁcant limitations. CTA is
not appropriate for screening purposes, because of its signiﬁcant cost
