 venous disease (CEAP C3 to C6) in only
14.8%.66 Although such limbs may show plethysmographic
evidence of venous outflow obstruction,66 this is usually

well compensated due to axial transformation of the profunda femoris vein through remnants of the axial limb
vein.67
Multicenter registries have further suggested a less
favorable outcome for femoropopliteal than for iliofemoral
DVT treated with thrombolytic therapy.16 Although an
effect of thrombus chronicity cannot be excluded, 1-year
patency was achieved in only 47% of limbs with femoropopliteal thrombosis compared with 64% of limbs with iliofemoral thrombosis. Complete lysis was not achieved in any
patient with femoropopliteal DVT present for â¬Ž10 days.
Although recommendations may change with the availability of better-quality evidence, there is currently little evidence supporting a role for early thrombus removal strategies in the treatment of femoropopliteal DVT. However,
we must acknowledge that the beneficial effects of early
thrombus removal were not substantially changed if studies
not explicitly evaluating the treatment of iliofemoral DVT
were included in the systematic review.19 This at least raises
the possibility that these strategies may have some role in
the treatment of femoropopliteal DVT.
3. Techniques for early thrombus removal
3.1. We suggest percutaneous catheter-based techniques (pharmacologic or pharmacomechanical) as
first-line therapy for early thrombus removal in patients meeting the criteria in 1.1 (Grade 2C). Compared with standard anticoagulant therapy, catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolytic therapy is associated
with significant reductions in the risks of the postthrombotic syndrome (relative risk [RR], 0.19; 95% CI .07.48), venous reflux (RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.09-0.53), and
venous obstruction (RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.3
