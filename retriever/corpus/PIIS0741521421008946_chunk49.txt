% (all ipsilateral) and 2.9% for group B (P ¼
.85 and P ¼.60, respectively). The risk of all neurologic
events (stroke and TIA) and perioperative events was
18.4% and 2% for group A and 9.7% and 5.4% for group
B (P ¼ .113 and P ¼.27, respectively). At 5 years, the cumulative stroke-free survival was 84% in group A and
77% in group B (P > .1). Notably, all patients were
routinely shunted. In this report, survival rates and risk
of perioperative and all late strokes were comparable
in patients with contralateral occlusion and to those
without.196
Because there is a demonstrable risk of CNI after CEA
that is absent after transfemoral CAS, patients with a history of a contralateral vocal cord paralysis are at
increased risk with CEA vs transfemoral CAS. Thus, transfemoral CAS may be preferred in these patients.
High risk for transfemoral CAS.
Hostile nonvascular anatomy. Because of the remote
location in which the carotid bifurcation is accessed,
the impact of hostile nonvascular anatomy on
transfemoral-CAS stroke risk is minimal and in many instances is the preferred approach for treating these
patients.

Medical high risk. Transfemoral CAS is associated with
higher stroke risk than CEA in patients aged more than
80 years,5,197-199 and in the CREST study, transfemoral
CAS was associated with increased stroke risk in patients
aged more than 70 years.5 This was conﬁrmed in a metaanalysis of four randomized trials comparing CEA and
transfemoral CAS.199 Similarly, a study by Hicks et al200
using VQI data demonstrated a higher risk of stroke
and death in patients meeting Medicare high-risk criteria
(HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.05-2.60; P ¼ .03) undergoing
