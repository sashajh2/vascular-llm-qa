EVLA of thigh IPVs,
followed by
ablation of GSV
(IPVA) below IPV
(n ¼ 34)

EVLA of GSV

(n ¼ 35)

Technical success
signiﬁcantly lower
with IPVA (76.5%) vs
GSVA (100%; P ¼ .002;
no signiﬁcant
difference in clinical
success (continued
closure of treated vein)
between IPVA and
GSVA (1 week: 96.1% vs
100%; 1 month: 100%
vs 97.1%; 3, 6, and
12 months: 100% for
both groups); no
signiﬁcant difference
in occurrence and
degree of
complications
between both groups

RCT

38 Limbs in 35
patients with
incompetent
GSVs and $1
IPV

GSV stripping and
phlebectomy
with open
ligation of IPV
(n ¼ 21)

GSV stripping and
phlebectomy
only (n ¼ 17)

No signiﬁcant difference
between groups in
either preoperative or
postoperative venous
function (venous
volume, venous ﬁlling
index, ejection
fraction); at 3 months,
DUS failed to identify
previously seen IPVs in
w50% of patients (8/
17) without open
ligation of IPV
