Evidence. In a recent Cochrane systematic review and
meta-analysis 3632 patients from 35 RCTs were studied.186 Treatments of telangiectasias and reticular veins
included sclerosing agents, laser and compression. There
was moderate-certainty evidence that sclerotherapy was
better than placebo (SMD, 3.08; 95% CI, 2.68-3.48), but it
resulted in more hyperpigmentation, matting and pain.

Polidocanol had results similar to other sclerosing
agents, but it was less painful. Sodium tetradecyl sulphate sclerotherapy resulted in resolution or improvement of telangiectasias similar to other agents but there
was more hyperpigmentation, matting and probably
more pain. Foam likely caused more matting than liquid
sclerosing agents.
