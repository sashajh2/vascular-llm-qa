 calf muscle
pump; the role of advanced dressings; and preventing progression to VLU. These areas received special attention in
review for the current guidelines.
The surgery/endovascular and compression sections
were selected for a de novo development of speciﬁc guideline recommendations based on several of these key questions. For additional systematic review involving these
critical areas, the Venous Ulcer Guidelines Committee
commissioned an independent group of researchers to
conduct two systematic reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of different compression strategies and endovascular
and open surgical approaches. The Committee helped
develop a priori the protocols of these reviews in terms of
outcome selection and criteria for including studies with
additional analysis by the Knowledge and Evaluations
Research Unit at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minn).30,31
In the literature review, several processes were used to
minimize heterogeneity:
- Languagedall would be included.
- Type of Studies Revieweddrandomized controlled
trials, controlled clinical trials with cohort, and retrospective large observational case series. The studies
should be published in peer-reviewed journals.
- Target Audiencedthis Guideline document is intended for specialists who treat vascular disease and
wounds.
Through an iterative process, the committee developed
guidelines based on the grading of recommendation assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) system
(Table I).32,33 The strength of the recommendations is
