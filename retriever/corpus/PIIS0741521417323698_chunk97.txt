 degeneration at or
above the graft.
The transperitoneal approach is typically performed using a midline incision from the xiphoid to the symphysis
pubis or, in select cases, a minilaparotomy incision. After
placement of a self-retaining retractor, the transverse colon is retracted cephalad and the small bowel mesentery
to the right side of the abdomen, splaying the retroperitoneum and aortic aneurysm. The retroperitoneum is

incised to the left side of the aorta, avoiding the IMA. The
inferior mesenteric vein may need to be divided to avoid
inadvertent traction injury or avulsion by ﬁxed retractors
used to assist in exposing the infrarenal aortic neck.
The left renal vein may need to be mobilized, and if
suprarenal clamp placement is required, division of the
