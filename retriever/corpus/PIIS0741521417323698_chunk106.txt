OSR is signiﬁcantly higher compared with EVAR, particularly cardiac, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, and
wound-related complications (Table VIII). Finally, recent
studies have shown that >20% of the patients treated
by OSR require reoperations for laparotomy-related
complications within 8 years.364
The impact of individual surgeon and hospital volume
on outcomes of AAA OSR has been documented in
several studies.145,434,440,441 A review of national Medicare
claims by Birkmeyer and coworkers indicated that 30day mortality was 8% for low-volume hospitals (<17/y)
compared with 4.4% in high-volume hospitals (>79/
y).440 Surgeon volume and prior dedicated vascular
training also affect mortality of OSR. Dimick and associates reported that elective AAA mortality was lowest
when operations were performed by vascular surgeons
(2.2%) compared with cardiac surgeons (4%) and general
surgeons (5.5%; P < .001).442 Using a risk-adjusted analysis, high hospital volume, vascular surgery specialty,
and high surgeon volume were independent predictors
for lower risk of in-hospital mortality after elective AAA
repair. In that study, absolute risk reduction for operations performed in high-volume hospitals and by highvolume surgeons was 30% and 40%, respectively. AAA
repair performed by a general surgeon increased risk of
death by 76% compared with repair performed by a
vascular surgeon.442 A recent risk-adjusted analysis of
122,495 Medicare patients undergoing elective AAA
repair between 2001 and 2008 noted that the mortality
for OSR is directly related to medical center volume.367
