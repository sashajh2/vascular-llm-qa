For clinical examination of the lower limbs for chronic venous disease, we recommend
inspection (telangiectasia, varicosity, edema, skin discoloration, corona
phlebectatica, lipodermatosclerosis, ulcer), palpation (cord, varicosity, tenderness,
induration, reflux, pulses, thrill, groin or abdominal masses) auscultation (bruit),
and examination of ankle mobility. Patients should be asked for symptoms of
chronic venous disease, which may include tingling, aching, burning, pain, muscle
cramps, swelling, sensations of throbbing or heaviness, itching skin, restless legs, leg
tiredness, and fatigue.

We recommend that in patients with chronic venous disease, a complete history and
detailed physical examination are complemented by duplex scanning of the deep
and superficial veins. The test is safe, noninvasive, cost-effective, and reliable.
We recommend that the four components of a complete duplex scanning
examination for chronic venous disease should be visualization, compressibility,
venous flow, including measurement of duration of reflux, and augmentation.
We recommend that reflux to confirm valvular incompetence in the upright
position of the patients be elicited in one of two ways: either with increased intraabdominal pressure using a Valsalva maneuver to assess the common femoral vein
and the saphenofemoral junction, or for the more distal veins, use of manual or
cuff compression and release of the limb distal to the point of examination.
We recommend a cutoff value of 1 second for abnormally reversed flow (reflux) in
the femoral and popliteal veins and of 500 ms for the great saphenous vein, the
small saphenous vein, the tibial, deep femoral, and the perforating veins.
We recommend that in patients with chronic venous insufficiency, duplex scanning
of
