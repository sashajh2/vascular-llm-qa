agulation or
antiplatelet medication, or had a comorbidity such as
dementia or liver failure. These rare case reports describe
pulsatile bleeding both from the thin-wall veins themselves and from exposed veins in a venous ulcer bed
leading to hypovolemic shock and death, especially in
the presence of ischemic heart disease.270 Another
single-center study found that patients with bleeding
episodes had decreased access to basic ﬁrst aid or hemorrhage control techniques.264
As many of the fatal hemorrhagic events can be prevented, it is critical that patients be asked about prior
bleeding episodes, be warned about the possibility,
and be instructed in ﬁrst aid and hemorrhage control
techniques, such as leg elevation and direct compression on the bleeding varicose veins. The danger of
applying venous tourniquets and increasing venous
pressure has often been emphasized in the literature.266

Evidence. Both because of the infrequency of
bleeding events and the difﬁculty in leaving such patients untreated, no studies comparing intervention to
conservative management have been performed. However, very limited evidence does suggest that fatal hemorrhage usually occurs after a previous untreated
episode of bleeding266 and there is general consensus
that patients should be treated after the ﬁrst episode of
hemorrhage.267,271 Furthermore, there is evidence from
single-center series that superﬁcial venous intervention
reduces recurrent hemorrhage. Selection of an appropriate treatment modality is somewhat dependent of
the patient’s venous anatomy and size of the bleeding
vein. Among 5 patients reported in one series, acute
control of venous hemorrhage was successfully achieved with direct injection of 1% polidocanol foam into
the bleeding varicosity with or without FS (3% polidocanol) of the associated saphenous trunk. No recurrent
bleeding was noted after a mean follow-up of
17.4 months.272 A larger series reported successful acute
control of bleeding in 72 patients treated with FS.271 In
comparison with 52 patients treated with simple suture
ligation, FS was associated with faster wound healing (7
vs 14 days; P < .001) and a lower risk of recurrent
bleeding at
