 varicose veins of the pelvis and in 18% to 22% of pregnant
women.82

Seventy-two symptomatic patients with pelvic source
varicose veins, however, only 7% had chronic pelvic
pain.84 In a systematic review of 13 studies on ovarian
vein embolization in 866 women, technical success was
99.8%; signiﬁcant improvement of pelvic pain was reported in nine studies.85 In one study, lower extremity
varicosities recurred only in 13% at 5 years after embolization.85 Hartung et al86 reported 51% improvement in
lower extremity varicosity following ovarian vein embolization in 119 women, who had both pelvic symptoms and
lower extremity varicose veins. In another study of 43 patients, Castenmiller et al87 showed improvement after
ovarian vein embolization in the lower extremity varicose
veins in 14%, but the success rate was 88% for treatment
of vulvar varicose veins.
Gavrilov reported good clinical results with direct treatment of vulvar varicosities with FS and phlebectomy.82 In
32 patients with asymptomatic pelvic varicose veins,
phlebectomy alone for vulvar varices resulted in no recurrence at 3 to 8 years after the procedure. Sclerotherapy
was effective at 1 year in 10 of 12 patients.82 Current
consensus of experts supports the strategy of direct
treatment of pelvic origin varicose veins in patients with
asymptomatic pelvic reﬂux using liquid or FS, phlebectomy, or pelvic escape points ligation, without the need
for pelvic vein embolization.56,82,83
2. Compression therapy
2.1. Compression therapy vs intervention.
2.1.1. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the superﬁcial truncal veins, we suggest compression therapy for primary treatment if the
patient’s ambulatory status or underlying medical conditions warrant a conservative approach or, if the patient prefers conservative treatment, for either a trial
period or deﬁnitive management.
