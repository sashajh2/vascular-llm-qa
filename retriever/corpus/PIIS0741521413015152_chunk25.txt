IfI 030.
Example 2: A 55-year-old man with diabetes, dry gangrene of two toes, and a <2-cm rim of cellulitis at the base of the toes, but without
systemic or metabolic toxicity has absent pedal pulses. The ABI is 1.5. The toe pressure is 35 mm Hg. He would be classiﬁed as Wound 2
Ischemia 2 foot Infection 1 or WIfI 221.
IV. Stages: The four clinical stages were derived by Delphi Consensus (Table IV) and will require prospective validation. This process is
intended to be iterative and is meant to reduce the number of clinical stages to a manageable and meaningful number; the stages should
correlate with amputation risk (natural history of limb with that given clinical stage in the absence of revascularization). Using the same
patient examples as above:
Example 1: A patient with ischemic rest pain, an ABI of 0.30, no wound, and no signs of infection would be classiﬁed as: Wound
0 Ischemia 3 foot Infection 0 or WIfI 030. The consensus clinical stage is 2 (low) with respect to risk of major limb amputation at one
year.
Example 2: A 55-year-old man with diabetes, dry gangrene of two toes, and a <2-cm rim of cellulitis at the base of the toes, but without
systemic or metabolic toxicity has absent pedal pulses. The ABI is 1.5. The toe pressure is 35 mm Hg. He would be classiﬁed as Wound 2
Ischemia 2 foot Infection 1 or WIfI 221. The clinical stage would be 4 (high risk of amputation).
ABI, Ankle-brachial index.

produces a grid with 64 theoretically possible clinical
combinations (WIfI classes). To deﬁne initially the system’s
potential clinical applicability, a Delphi consensus process
was carried out by members of the SVS Lower Extremity
Guidelines Committee and recognized experts in the ﬁeld
of chronic limb ischemia. This 12-member group was
instructed to use the classiﬁcation system to
