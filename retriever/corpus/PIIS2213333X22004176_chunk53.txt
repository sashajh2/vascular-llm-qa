eter-based techniques. Long-term results
and comparative studies with PEM are needed.
Early adverse events were reported to be more frequent
after EVLA or RFA than after CAC (Table III).92,188 Some
clinical advantages of CAC compared with thermal techniques for #1 year, have been demonstrated in several
reports.92,172,179,188 However, a prospective study by Ay
et al150 found that the QoL (CIVIQ-14) was better for a
group of 70 patients who had undergone RFA than for
the 85 patients who had been treated with CAC (P <
.05). However, RFA at 1 year was associated with an
increased risk of recurrent incompetence compared
with CAC (RR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.07-9.64; I2 ¼ 0.00%).179,188
In a systematic review, Vos et al192 reported that the
pooled anatomic success for MOCA and CAC was
94.7% and 94.8% at 6 months and 94.1% and 89.0% at
1 year, respectively. In a network meta-analysis, Kolluri
et al193 compared the early outcomes with VenaSeal
(Medtronic) with those after EVLA, RFA, MOCA, sclerotherapy, and open surgery. At 6 months, VenaSeal had
had the highest probability of anatomic success, ranked
ﬁrst in the reduction of the postoperative pain score from
baseline (P ¼ .690), and had had the lowest incidence of
adverse events (P ¼ .650). The 3-year occlusion rate after
CAC treatment was 94.7% (95% CI, 87.9%-100%) in a prospective study by Almeida et al.90 An allergic reaction to
cyanoacrylate is rare but has been reported,194 and those

with previous hypersensitivity reactions to cyanoacrylates
and patients with acute superﬁcial thrombophlebitis or
sepsis should not
