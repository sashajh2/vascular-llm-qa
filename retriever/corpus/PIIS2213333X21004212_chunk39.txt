 SFJ; however, in assessing 90% of
limbs, DUS examination did not affect surgical management. Nevertheless, it should be noted that a DUS examination is performed routinely during endovenous
procedures, which allows a surgeon to modify their
approach, even when a preprocedure study is inaccurate.
Four other diagnostic studies121-124 did not meet the
eligibility criteria of deﬁning retrograde ﬂow in the GSV
of more than 500 ms, but overall adds to the body of
evidence supporting duplex scanning for evaluation of
patients with varicose veins. One study121 compared
DUS examination with HHD examination and clinical examination and demonstrated that the sensitivity of the
HHD to detect saphenous vein reﬂux was 56% at the
SFJ and 23% at the SPJ. Clinical examination failed to
correctly plan the treatment in 26% of proposed operations. In 9% of limbs, a HHD examination-based treatment plan was modiﬁed based on DUS ﬁndings. The
second study123 compared HHD examination with
diagnostic-quality portable color Doppler ultrasound examination and conventional DUS examination as the
gold standard for venous reﬂux disease assessment. The
study demonstrated that sensitivity of HHD examination
improves from moderate to good from the above-knee
level (68%) to the below-knee level (94%), but suffers
poor speciﬁcity. The third study122 compared HHD examination with DUS examination in assessing primary and
uncomplicated varicose veins and suggested a high
sensitivity and speciﬁcity for GSV incompetence identiﬁed by HHD examination. However, HHD examination
incorrectly diagnosed reﬂux at SPJ in some patients.
The fourth study124 compared color ﬂow duplex
scanning with venography and suggested that venographic reﬂux correlates best with duplex scan ﬁndings
of a reﬂux duration of greater than 0.5 second.
The second key question was about the effectiveness,
safety, and durability of HL/S compared with any endovenous ablation technique. To collect evidence, we
analyzed data of 30 RCTs26-60,1
