valve, or one that can be made competent, be placed above
the site where the incompetent venous systems are
implanted into the axial vein. One example would be the
presence of a competent valve in the proximal deep femoral
vein, below which the incompetent femoral vein can be
implanted to result in a then competent femoral venous
system. In the select cohort of patients who are amenable
to this intervention, a 40% to 50% competency rate with
similar freedom from ulcer recurrence has been reported
in a number of case series reports at 5 years of follow-up
(Table XI).376,391,395,399-405
Venous valve transplantation involves harvesting of a
competent segment of vein that contains a competent valve
from another extremity and implanting it into the femoral or
popliteal position to provide a functioning valve in the
affected extremity. Adjunctive use of endophlebectomy
and the need for an arteriovenous ﬁstula to increase ﬂow
through the reconstruction sites are additional considerations. The long-term competency rate at 2 to 5 years is
w50%, with a slightly higher freedom from ulcer recurrence
rate.359-368,377,405,406 Table XII includes representative
