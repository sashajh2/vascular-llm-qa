 identiﬁcation of medical conditions that affect ulcer healing and other nonvenous causes of
ulcers. [BEST PRACTICE]
Guideline 3.3: Wound Documentation
We recommend serial venous leg ulcer wound measurement and documentation. [BEST PRACTICE]
Guideline 3.4: Wound Culture
We suggest against routine culture of venous leg ulcers and only to obtain wound culture specimens when clinical evidence of infection is present. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 3.5: Wound Biopsy
We recommend wound biopsy for leg ulcers that do not improve with standard wound and compression
therapy after 4 to 6 weeks of treatment and for all ulcers with atypical features. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 3.6: Laboratory Evaluation
We suggest laboratory evaluation for thrombophilia for patients with a history of recurrent venous thrombosis
and chronic recurrent venous leg ulcers. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 3.7: Arterial Testing
We recommend arterial pulse examination and measurement of ankle-brachial index on all patients with venous
leg ulcer. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 3.8: Microcirculation Assessment
We suggest against routine microcirculation assessment of venous leg ulcers but suggest selective consideration
as an adjunctive assessment for monitoring of advanced wound therapy. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 3.9: Venous Duplex Ultrasound
We recommend comprehensive venous duplex ultrasound examination of the lower extremity in all patients
with suspected venous leg ulcer. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 3.10: Venous Plethysmography
We suggest selective use of venous plethysmography in the evaluation of patients with suspected venous leg
ulcer if venous duplex ultrasound does not provide deﬁnitive diagnostic information. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE - B]
Guideline 3.11: Venous Imaging
We suggest selective computed tomography venography, magnetic resonance venography, contrast venography,
and/or intravascular ultrasound in patients with suspected venous leg ulcer
