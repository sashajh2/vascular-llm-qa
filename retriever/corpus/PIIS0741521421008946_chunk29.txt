 reducing overall ischemic events.131 However,
analysis of a subset of patients with a prior history of
stroke in the CAPRIE trial demonstrated no difference
in incidence of vascular events.131 In the European/Australasian Stroke Prevention in Reversible Ischemia Trial,
patients were randomized to aspirin or aspirin þ
extended release dipyridamole therapy within 6 months
of a TIA or stroke. The study showed a statistically significant lower rate of vascular events in patients who
received the combination regimen.132
In the Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes trial, patients received either clopidogrel or
aspirin þ extended release dipyridamole. This trial
showed no difference in the rate of recurrent strokes,
but there was a lower incidence of major hemorrhagic
events in the clopidogrel group.133 In a recent metaanalysis of 13 randomized clinical trials of patients with
cerebral infarction, patients who received aspirin þ dipyridamole had lower mortality compared with those who
received aspirin þ clopidogrel (OR , 0.46; 95% CI, 0.180.99).134
There is considerable evidence supporting dual antiplatelet therapy in secondary stroke prevention. In the Clopidogrel in High Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling
Cerebrovascular events (CHANCE) trial, patients were randomized to aspirin þ clopidogrel or aspirin alone within
24 hours of experiencing a TIA or minor stroke. Stroke
occurred in 8.2% of patients in the aspirin þ clopidogrel
group, compared with 11.7% of patients who took aspirin
alone (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57-0.81; P < .001). Moderate or severe hemorrhage occurred in seven patients (0.3%) in the

clopidogrel-aspirin group and in eight (0.3%) in the aspirin
group (P ¼ .73) and the rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.3%
in each group.135 A subsequent meta-analysis assessed trials including the following regimens: Aspirin þ clopidogrel
