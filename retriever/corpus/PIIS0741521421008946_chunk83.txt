This is meta-analysis of several randomized trials.

CREST, patching was also associated with a signiﬁcant
reduction in 30-day risk of perioperative stroke (1.2% vs
4% for no patching; P ¼ .02), reduction in perioperative
stroke and death (1.2% vs 4%; P ¼ .02).290 At 4 years,
patching was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in
late stroke (3.5% vs 6.6% for no patching; P ¼ .047), and
stroke and death (3.5% vs 6.6%; P ¼ .047). Restenosis
risk was also signiﬁcantly higher at 2 years in patients
with no patching (10.7% vs 3.1% with patching) (Table IV).
Recently, Edenﬁeld et al291 reported on the long-term
impact of the Vascular Study Group of New England carotid patch quality initiative (14,636 CEA), showing that
patch use increased from 71% to 91% (P < .001) between
2003 and 2014. The rate of return to the operating room
for bleeding (P < .001), 1-year restenosis or occlusion (P <
.001), and 1-year stroke or TIA (P < .003) were statistically
lower with patch closure. High-volume surgeons
increased patch use from 50% to 90%, and decreased
their 1-year stroke or TIA risk from 4.9% to 1.9% (P <
.001) and restenosis risk from 9.0% to 1.2%.
