Horse chestnut seed extract. A separate Cochrane
review of 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found
that horse chestnut seed extract (aescin) was effective to
decrease edema, pain, and itching.129
Pentoxifylline. The effect of pentoxifylline on ulcer
healing was investigated in an RCT by Dale et al.133 In a
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, complete healing of
venous ulcers was observed in 64% of patients receiving
pentoxifylline and in 53% of the patients receiving placebo.
However, the difference was not statistically significant.
In another RCT, Falanga et al134 investigated the effect
of pentoxifylline on ulcer healing in 133 patients. Patients
who were given 800 mg of pentoxifylline three times a day
healed faster than those receiving placebo (P ⫽ .043). The
median time to complete healing was 100, 83, and 71 days
for placebo, pentoxifylline (400 mg), and pentoxifylline
(800 mg) three times a day, respectively. A higher dose of
pentoxifylline (800 mg three times a day) was more effective than the lower dose, although the higher dose had
more significant gastrointestinal upset. The study concluded that pentoxifylline is effective in accelerating healing
of leg ulcers.
In a more recent RCT, evidence to add pentoxifylline
to a regimen of high-compression therapy to increase the
chances of wound healing was of moderate quality.135
Pentoxifylline increased the proportion of ulcer healing
compared with placebo, although this finding was only
statistically significant (P ⫽ .046) when a secondary adjusted analysis was conducted. Pentoxifylline in an oral dose
of 400 mg three times daily is suggested to patients with
venous ulcers in addition to local care, compression garment, or intermittent compression pump (ICP) in the
venous guidelines of
