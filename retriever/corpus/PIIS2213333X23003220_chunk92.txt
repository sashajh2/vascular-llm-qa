 of evidence was
low in the systematic review, ambulatory phlebectomy of
varicose tributaries creating a venous reservoir may have a
positive effect on truncal reﬂux and ASVAL may be an
effective minimally invasive treatment of CVD. Best results were seen in those patients who had a competent
terminal valve at the SFJ.177 The level of evidence for
ASVAL was upgraded to B (moderate) because of the
recently published SAPTAP RCT.176 In this multicenter,
noninferiority RCT single ambulatory phlebectomy (SAP)
was performed in 227 patients and RFA with phlebectomy was done in 237 patients, all with truncal reﬂux and
varicose veins. At 1 year, VEINES-QOL/Sym scores were
noninferior after SAP compared with thermal truncal
ablation and SAP was a cost-effective alternative to
thermal truncal ablation. Twenty-six percent of the SAP
patients underwent additional truncal ablation.176

we suggest preserving the GSV using the ambulatory
conservative hemodynamic correction of venous
