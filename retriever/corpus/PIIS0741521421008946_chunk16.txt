OPTIMAL MEDICAL THERAPY AND RISK FACTOR
MODIFICATION
Treatment of hypertension
Hypertension is a well-recognized risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including carotid artery
disease and stroke. The association between blood pressure and stroke is independent of other risk factors for
stroke, and blood pressure reduction decreases this
risk.54,55 Each 10 mm Hg increase in blood pressure is associated with a 30% to 45% increased risk of stroke and each
10 mm Hg blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients decreased the risk of stroke by 33%.56 There is no
Level 1 evidence from randomized clinical trials assessing
the inﬂuence of blood pressure reduction on stroke prevention among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenoses.
However, a meta-analysis of 25 randomized clinical trials
including patients without documented vascular disease
demonstrated signiﬁcant decreases in the incidence of
late strokes (relative risk reduction 45%; 95% CI, 35-55),
and stroke reduction was proportional to the reduction in
systolic blood pressure.57 In addition, a meta-analysis of
147 randomized clinical trials of hypertensive therapy
among patients with a history of stroke demonstrated a
signiﬁcant relative risk reduction in stroke incidence with
antihypertensive therapy (34%; 95% CI, 15-32).57
However, there is no convincing evidence supporting
