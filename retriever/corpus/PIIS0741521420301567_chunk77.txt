 for cases of acute rupture and gastrointestinal
bleeding.1,7,111,186-188 Endovascular interventions offer precise localization of the aneurysm, assessment of collateral
ﬂow, lower risk for patients who are not good operative
candidates, easier approach to aneurysms for which surgical exposure would be difﬁcult, and decreased length of
stay.1,111 These beneﬁts are balanced with a risk of intestinal
necrosis, perforation, and late stricture requiring reoperation in addition to primary technical failures and failed hemostasis in the setting of rupture.189-193
Regression of aneurysms resulting from polyarteritis
nodosa after cytotoxic or immunosuppressive treatment
is well documented.107 As such, medical therapy should
be considered ﬁrst line for these patients with nonruptured, asymptomatic aneurysms, with repeated arteriography staged at 3 to 4 months to ascertain regression.

arterial mediolysis is suspected, given the systemic nature of this arterial dysplasia, with one-time screening
CTA or MRA of the head, neck, and chest.146
We recommend routine interval surveillance (ie, every
12 months) with axial imaging (ie, CTA or MRA) in cases
of segmental medial arteriolysis in light of reported cases
of rapid arterial transformation.147
We recommend postembolization surveillance every 1
to 2 years with axial imaging to assess for vascular
remodeling.1
