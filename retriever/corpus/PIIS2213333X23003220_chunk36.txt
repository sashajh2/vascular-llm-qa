001).74 Gianesini et al75 retrospectively analyzed long-term results of the CHIVA procedure in 381 patients and found an increased risk of GSV
reﬂux recurrence among those patients who initially had
reﬂuxing common femoral veins.75 Other investigators
found that ablation of superﬁcial reﬂux may restore
segmental competence of the deep veins76 and that
clinical outcome is excellent after superﬁcial ablation,
despite the presence of deep venous reﬂux.60,71 In one
study, those with persistent symptoms after superﬁcial
vein ablation had femoral or popliteal vein reﬂux velocities
of >10 cm/second.60
Data on infrainguinal deep vein obstruction and interventions on superﬁcial veins are sparse because many
vascular specialists avoid superﬁcial truncal ablation in
patients with extensive post-thrombotic deep vein
obstruction. There is a very low level of evidence that
saphenous ablation can be performed in patients with
femoropopliteal venous occlusion.77 It is important to
remember that, in severely symptomatic patients with
infrainguinal obstruction, the GSV may be used for
deep vein reconstruction.78 Occasionally, reconstruction
of the femoral vein is needed after superﬁcial truncal
ablation in patients, who have congenital absence or severe hypoplasia of the deep veins.79
In a systematic review of superﬁcial venous reﬂux in patients with deep venous obstruction, Benfor and Peden25
suggested that superﬁcial ablation can be performed in
patients with deep vein occlusions, but noted that the evidence to support this recommendation was weak. Most
patients in this review had suprainguinal/iliofemoral
obstruction and most had advanced CVD. In a series of
29 patients with a history of previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) Puggioni et al80 did not ﬁnd an increased
incidence of thrombotic complications after RFA.
