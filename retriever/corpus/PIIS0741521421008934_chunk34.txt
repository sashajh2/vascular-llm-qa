id bruit; and known peripheral arterial
disease (PAD).78 Based on these and other reports, the
SVS does advocate carotid artery screening for high-risk
patients aged $55 years with appropriate cardiovascular
risk factors.75,79
Other investigators have noted that the prevalence of
occult carotid stenosis is increased in those with diabetes
compared with those without diabetes (8.7% vs 2.8%; P <
.01)80 and in patients requiring hemodialysis and undergoing tunneled catheter placement (9.8%).81 In a study of
1500 subjects speciﬁcally recruited for carotid screening,
the overall prevalence of signiﬁcant stenosis was 5.2%.
The independent predictors of an increased prevalence
of carotid stenosis included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and a
family history of stroke.82 One investigator reported that
screening of asymptomatic patients is appropriate if
they were aged $60 years and had three or more traditional atherosclerotic risk factors.83
However, few direct comparative studies have evaluated the efﬁcacy of screening with respect to the actual
clinical outcomes of stroke or death. Most reported
studies have used the prevalence of signiﬁcant carotid
stenosis in the studied populations as the actual
outcome measure. In a report by Berens et al,84 >1000
patients aged $65 years who were undergoing cardiac
surgery were screened with carotid duplex ultrasound
scans before surgery. The prevalence of disease was
17% for those with $50% stenosis and 5.9% those with
$80% stenosis. Using multivariate analysis, ﬁve variables
were found to be signiﬁcant independent predictors of
$80% stenosis: female sex, peripheral vascular disease,
a history of TIA or stroke, a positive smoking history,
and the presence of left main coronary disease. If all patients with at least one of those risk factors were
screened, the mathematical model predicted that 95%
of the patients with $80% stenosis would be identiﬁed
before their cardiac operation.84
