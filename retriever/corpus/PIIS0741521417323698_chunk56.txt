184 Transabdominal ultrasound is ideal for
screening and surveillance185 but insufﬁciently precise for
procedural planning or more complex morphologic analyses.186-188
CT imaging is more reproducible than ultrasound, with
>90% of measurements within 2 mm of the initial
reading.189 Both techniques suffer from a lack of standardization in terms of determining the degree and
rate of disease progression.190 An aneurysm measured
by standard axial CT is generally >2 mm larger in diameter than when it is measured by ultrasound. Most
commonly, the cross-sectional measurement obtained
by CT is not necessarily perpendicular to the path of
the aorta, which presumably contributes to an overestimation of aneurysm size. There is also signiﬁcant
