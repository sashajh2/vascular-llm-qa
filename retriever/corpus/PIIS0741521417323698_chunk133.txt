 the time of repair, every attempt should
be made to treat it before the conclusion of the procedure. Balloon molding of the proximal seal zone, placement of a proximal cuff, and endostaples have all been
used with varying degrees of success.643 Endostaples
may reduce the risk of endograft migration and a type
IA endoleak, but long-term data are limited.643,644
Other options for type IA endoleak treatment include
embolization with coils or glue,645,646 proximal extension
with a chimney approach,376 and conversion to a fenestrated endograft.375 A type IB endoleak is treated with distal
extension of the iliac limb if repeated angioplasty fails to
eliminate the endoleak. It may be necessary to extend the
endograft to the external iliac artery with coil occlusion of
the HA. Conversion to open repair should be considered
in the presence of a persistent type IA endoleak.647
Type II endoleak. Persistent ﬁlling of the aneurysm
sac from patent lumbar arteries or the IMA constitutes
a type II endoleak.634-636 Type II endoleaks are the most
common endoleak, present at the time of repair in up to
one-fourth of patients. When a type II endoleak is identiﬁed at the time of the procedure, treatment is not
indicated as at least 50% will spontaneously
resolve.640,645,646,648 The incidence of type II endoleak at 6
months is 10% to 15%.649-651 Factors that increase the risk
of a persistent type II endoleak include a patent IMA,
number and diameter of patent lumbar arteries (especially L3 and L4 lumbar arteries), and ongoing anticoagulation.652-655
The fate of persistent type II endoleaks is variable. Aneurysm sac size may decrease in up to 25%,649,656 remain stable in 50% to 70%,657 or increase in up to 25%
