Treatment of an endograft infection poses unique challenges. A dense inﬂammatory reaction can completely
obliterate natural tissue planes, and endograft hooks or
suprarenal ﬁxation may dictate the need for supraceliac
cross-clamping to explant the device. Furthermore,
hooks and the suprarenal segment may be embedded
into the aortic wall or covered with a pseudointima,
requiring careful removal to avoid injury to the operator
and aortic wall as well as to preserve the aortic neck for
closure or in situ reconstruction. Despite the introduction
of endograft resheathing techniques, attendant renal
ischemia is an established risk. Percutaneous drainage
and antibiotic therapy have been suggested for patients
unﬁt to undergo open repair.696,710-712
An aortoenteric ﬁstula can complicate a graft infection
in 1% to 2% of patients.694,699 Although the duodenum is
most frequently affected, all viscera, including small and
large bowel, have been implicated.695,699 A common presentation is upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as a herald
bleed, which may progress to exsanguinating hemorrhage.713 Any upper gastrointestinal bleeding in a patient
with an aortic graft should raise the suspicion of an aortoenteric ﬁstula. The diagnosis may occasionally be
conﬁrmed by endoscopy or CT imaging.714-716 Bleeding
is more common when the anastomosis erodes into
the gastrointestinal tract, whereas sepsis and abscess formation are more common with paraprosthetic ﬁstula
involving the body of the graft. Treatment strategies are
similar to those for primary graft infections but must
include closure of the visceral defect.717 Whereas endovascular repair of an aortoenteric ﬁstula is uniformly unsuccessful, severe hemorrhage may necessitate the use
