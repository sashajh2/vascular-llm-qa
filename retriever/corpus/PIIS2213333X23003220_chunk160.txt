.1.1. For patients with SVT of the main saphenous
trunks and tributaries above the knee >3 cm from
the SFJ and $5 cm in length, whether or not associated with varicose veins, we recommend fondaparinux
2.5 mg subcutaneously daily for 45 days; alternatively,
rivaroxaban 10 mg/d for 45 days may be appropriate
for patients unwilling or unable to perform subcutaneous injections.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence: A (high)
12.1.2. For patients with SVT of the main saphenous
trunks #3 cm from the SFJ, treatment with full anticoagulation for a minimum of 6 weeks should be continued.
Consensus statement.
12.1.3 For patients with SVT of the main saphenous
trunks we suggest against using prophylactic or

therapeutic dose low-molecular weight heparin
(LMWH) and nonsteroid anti-inﬂammatory drugs
(NSAIDs). While both have been found to reduce
SVT pain and extension, they have failed to prevent
VTE. If NSAIDs are used for treatment of short
segment distal SVT, surveillance with DUS for VTE
extension is recommended due to the high prevalence of concomitant DVT.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 1 (strong),
Quality of Evidence: A (high)
12.1.4. For selected patients with isolated thrombosis
of varicose tributaries or limited involvement of the
GSV, we suggest phlebectomy as a safe alternative.
GUIDELINE. Grade of recommendation: 2 (weak),
Quality of Evidence: B (moderate)
12.1.5. In patients with saphenous thrombophlebitis,
ablation should be performed once the inﬂammation
has resolved if there is evidence of pathologic reﬂux
on DUS.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Despite recognition that superﬁcial thrombophlebitis, also known as SVT, is more common than
DVT, there is less awareness of its associated morbidity
and little consensus on its management.254 While traditionally thought of as benign, recent studies have
