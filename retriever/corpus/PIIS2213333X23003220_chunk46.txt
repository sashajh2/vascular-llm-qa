meta-analysis including six RCTs with patients Class C2
or higher, those treated with compression had less pain
within the ﬁrst 10 days postoperatively, and earlier return
to daily activities.13 No differences were noted in bruising
score, VCSS, QOL, complications, or vein occlusion rate. A
subgroup analysis of a meta-analysis, encompassing 1147
patients, suggested that the greatest beneﬁts in pain
reduction were in patients undergoing endovenous laser
