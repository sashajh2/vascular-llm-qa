compared with placebo (SMD, e0.35; 95% CI, e0.54 to
e0.17; 12 studies; 2232 participants). Thirty-seven studies
reported on adverse events; the most frequent were
gastrointestinal symptoms. Findings for speciﬁc groups
of VADs were limited due to small study numbers in
some studies and the heterogeneous results. The authors
downgraded certainty in the evidence from high to
moderate because of risk of bias concerns, and further to
low because of imprecision. It is clear from this review
and multiple other meta-analyses,14-16,112 however, that
some of these drugs or supplements are better than the
others.
The clinical beneﬁts of two compounds, MPFF and Ruscus extracts, have been studied more extensively in
double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs and metaanalyses and they are discussed in more detail here.
For evidence of clinical efﬁcacy of other VADs, including
hydroxyethylrutosides, calcium dobesilate, horse chestnut extract, red vine leaf extract and sulodexide for treatment of CVD, see Appendix I. Most studies with these
products have short (3-6 months) follow-ups; therefore,
long-term efﬁcacy and possible side effects of longterm treatment have not been formally assessed.
Clinical beneﬁt of MPFF.
Rationale. MPFF is composed of 90% diosmin and
