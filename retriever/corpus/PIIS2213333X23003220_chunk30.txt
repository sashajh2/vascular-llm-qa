.4.4. We recommend that a complete DUS examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities includes
measurement of the spectral Doppler waveform using
calipers. Reﬂux at baseline and in response to Valsalva
or distal augmentation in the common femoral vein
and at the SFJ should be documented. Reﬂux in
response to distal augmentation in the midfemoral
and popliteal veins, GSV at the proximal thigh and
knee, and in the AAGSV and SSV at the SPJ or proximal
calf should also be documented.
1.4.5. We recommend that a complete DUS examination for venous reﬂux in the lower extremities includes
diameter measurements with the patient’s leg in the
dependent position, from the anterior to posterior
wall, at the SFJ, in the GSV 1 cm distal to the SFJ, at
the proximal thigh and knee, in the AAGSV, and in
the SSV at the SPJ or proximal calf. Images of both
normal and abnormal ﬁndings should be documented
in the patient’s records.

vein guidelines.8
