 the third edition of the Handbook
of Venous Disorders, Guidelines of the American Venous
Forum.47
The guidelines in this publication are based on the
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development,
and Evaluation (GRADE) system, as it was described by
Guyatt et al (Table I).48 For each guideline, the letter A, B,
or C marks the level of current evidence. The grade of
recommendation of a guideline can be strong (1) or weak
(2), depending on the risk and burden of a particular
diagnostic test or a therapeutic procedure to the patient vs
the expected benefit. The words “we recommend” are used
for GRADE 1—strong recommendations—if the benefits
clearly outweigh risks and burdens, or vice versa; the words
“we suggest” are used for GRADE 2—weak recommendations—when the benefits are closely balanced with risks and
burdens.
DEFINITIONS
In this document, the updated terminology for superficial, perforating, and deep veins of the leg and pelvis are
used.49,50 Definitions of varicose and spider veins as well
as other manifestations of CVD follow recommendations
of the CEAP classification and the recent update on
venous terminology of the International Committee of
the AVF.51,52
Varicose veins of the lower limbs are dilated subcutaneous veins that are ⱖ3 mm in diameter measured in the
upright position.53 Synonyms include varix, varices, and
varicosities. Varicosity can involve the main axial superficial
veins—the great saphenous vein (GSV) or the small saphenous vein (SSV)— or any other superficial vein tributaries of
the lower limbs.
Most varicose veins are due to primary venous disease.
The most frequent cause is likely an intrinsic morphologic
or biochemical abnormality in the vein wall, although the
etiology can also be multifactorial. Labropoulos et al54
proposed that the origin of venous reflux in patients with
primary varicose veins can be local or multifocal structural
weakness of the vein wall and that this can occur together or
independently of proximal saphenous vein valvular incompetence. Varicosities can also develop as a result of secondary causes, such
