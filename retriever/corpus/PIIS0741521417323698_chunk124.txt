 in a 1:1:1 ratio and warm fresh whole blood instead of component
therapy have each been advocated.457,575,576 However,
retrospective studies have not consistently demonstrated a survival beneﬁt to a lower ratio of red cell transfusion to plasma transfusion for patients undergoing
open repair of a ruptured aneurysm.573,577 Furthermore,
withholding plasma and platelet transfusion until surgical repair is complete is not supported by clinical evidence. Optimal blood replacement therapy during
open repair has not been well deﬁned nor indications
established for administration of cryoprecipitate, plasma,
and platelets.578 A retrospective study has suggested
that administration of recombinant factor VIIa in the
setting of intractable intraoperative and postoperative
bleeding during vascular surgery has a survival beneﬁt.579
A Cochrane review of perioperative administration of
crystalloid and colloid ﬂuids for open abdominal aortic
surgery did not identify a superior regimen.580 However,
a recent prospective randomized study of elective open
repair of AAA concluded that a more restrictive perioperative ﬂuid regimen reduces complications and length of
hospital stay.581
We recommend using cell salvage or an ultraﬁltration device if
large blood loss is anticipated.

If the intraoperative hemoglobin level is <10 g/dL and blood
loss is ongoing, we recommend transfusion of packed blood
cells along with fresh frozen plasma and platelets in a ratio
of 1:1:1.

However, multiple randomized trials have shown no
measurable beneﬁt to the routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in nonselected patients.583-586 Whereas
transesophageal echocardiography is useful for those
