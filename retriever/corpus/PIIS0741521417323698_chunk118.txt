retroperitoneal approach is recommended to avoid
dissection of the duodenum. A systematic review of 999
patients with inﬂammatory aortic aneurysm conﬁrmed
that EVAR is associated with decreased mortality
compared with open repair.495-500
Horseshoe kidney. A horseshoe kidney occurs in 0.25%
of the general population and in 0.12% of patients
presenting with an aortic aneurysm.501 Preoperative
evaluation requires careful determination of the renal
arterial anatomy, which can be highly variable, with
accessory renal arteries originating from the aorta,
aneurysm sac, and iliac arteries.502-504 If the main renal
arteries are located proximal to the aneurysm, EVAR can
be safely performed.505,506 Small accessory renal arteries
may be covered by EVAR.507,508 In cases with anomalous
blood supply, OSR (preferably through a retroperitoneal
approach), hybrid repair, or fenestrated or branched
EVAR may be considered.509-511 Multiple renal arteries
can be surgically reimplanted using a Carrel patch or
through an inclusion technique.512 Should open repair
be required and CT imaging reveal that the horseshoe
kidney is associated with a thin ﬁbrous isthmus, a transperitoneal approach may be considered with division of
the “isthmus.”513-515 A hybrid approach has been
described using a bifurcated Dacron graft based off the
external iliac artery to revascularize the horseshoe kidney,
followed by EVAR.516,517 Likewise, repair has also been
described using a fenestrated endograft and snorkel
grafts.5
