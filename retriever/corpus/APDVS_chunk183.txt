ocytic leukemia (CLL). (Leuraud et al. 2015)
 Specifically, the study highlighted a direct correlation between cumulative red bone
marrow dose over a two-year period and the excess relative risk of developing leukemia.
 Their findings indicated that the relative risk of leukemia mortality was approximately
2.96 per Gy of exposure (RR = 2.94 per Gy).
While we won’t delve into the intricate details of these findings in this chapter, they underscore
the critical importance of considering lifelong radiation exposure and the need for effective
protective measures.



Pregnant Populations
When it comes to radiation exposure during pregnancy, there are important guidelines
and considerations to keep in mind.
 To monitor the radiation dose absorbed by the fetus, a dosimeter or radiation badge is
typically worn under the lead apron at the level of the abdomen.
 This dosimeter is checked monthly, and the absorbed dose is calculated accordingly.
 Fetal Harm Threshold: Ensure that the radiation dose does not exceed 0.5 mSv per
month or a maximum fetal dose of 5 mSv throughout the entire pregnancy


Lead Thickness Considerations for Pregnant Providers:
 Minimum Thickness: Pregnant individuals should wear a lead apron with a minimum
thickness of 0.5 mm. This ensures proper coverage of the abdomen, shielding the fetus
from radiation exposure.
 Double-Thickness Option: Alternatively, a double-thickness lead apron (1.0 mm) can
be worn. According to Vu et al. ((Elder and Vu 2013)), this reduces the absorbed dose
from 9 mrem to 3 mrem.
 Weight Consideration: However, it’s essential to recognize that wearing a thicker
lead apron may increase the risk of back injury due to the added weight. Balancing
protection and comfort is crucial.
As always, healthcare providers should adhere to the ALARA principles outlined above
(i.e. maintaining a maximum reasonable distance from the source, using the collimator, pulse
imaging, etc.).

Scenario
A 75-year-old male is scheduled for an angiogram of the left lower extremity to investigate and
potentially treat claudication symptoms. The attending vascular surgeon, with over 25 years
of experience in endovascular therapy, takes precautionary measures by wearing a thyroid
shield, prescription glasses, and a 2-piece
