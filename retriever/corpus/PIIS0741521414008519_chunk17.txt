 absence of structurally preserved axial deep venous valves when competent outﬂow venous pathways are
anatomically appropriate for surgical anastomosis in addition to standard compression therapy to aid in venous
leg ulcer healing and to prevent recurrence. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 6.13: Deep Venous Reﬂux With Skin Changes at Risk for Venous Leg Ulcer (C4b), Healed (C5) or
Active (C6) Venous Leg UlcerdAutogenous Valve Substitute
In a patient with infrainguinal deep venous reﬂux and skin changes at risk for venous leg ulcer (C4b), healed
venous leg ulcer (C5), or active venous leg ulcer (C6), we suggest consideration of autogenous valve substitutes
by surgeons experienced in these techniques to facilitate ulcer healing and to prevent recurrence in those with
no other option available in addition to standard compression therapy to aid in venous ulcer healing and to prevent
recurrence. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 6.14: Proximal Chronic Total Venous Occlusion/Severe Stenosis With Skin Changes at Risk for
Venous Leg Ulcer (C4b), Healed (C5) or Active (C6) Venous Leg UlcerdEndovascular Repair
In a patient with inferior vena cava or iliac vein chronic total occlusion or severe stenosis, with or without lower
extremity deep venous reﬂux disease, that is associated with skin changes at risk for venous leg ulcer (C4b), healed
venous leg ulcer (C5), or active venous leg ulcer (C6), we recommend venous angioplasty and stent recanalization in
addition to standard compression therapy to aid in venous ulcer healing and to prevent recurrence. [GRADE - 1;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Guideline 6.15: Proximal Chronic Venous Occlusion/Severe Stenosis (Bilateral) With Recalcitrant Venous
UlcerdOpen Repair
In a patient with inferior vena cava or iliac vein chronic occlusion or severe stenosis, with or without lower extremity deep venous reﬂux disease, that is associated with a rec
