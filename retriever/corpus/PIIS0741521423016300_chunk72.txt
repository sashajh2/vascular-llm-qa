 mL/min/1.73m2, these drugs are contraindicated. Therefore, it is advised to consider these drugs
in type 2 diabetes mellitus and peripheral artery disease
with an eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73m2 after careful review
and possibly adjustment of other blood glucose lowering
medication to prevent hypoglycaemia, but for SGLT-2
inhibitors there are additional caveats.
The SGLT-2 inhibitor canagliﬂozin was associated with
an increased risk of amputation in an RCT. This was not
a pre-speciﬁed endpoint and was not observed in the
other SGLT-2 inhibitor trials143 or in long term prospective
studies, as concluded in the ADA-EASD 2022 consensus
report.144 In addition, in post hoc analyses, these drugs
had beneﬁcial cardiovascular and renal effects in people
with peripheral artery disease.145 However, individuals
with foot ulcers were frequently excluded in SGLT-2 inhibitor trials and there is a second caveat to be considered.
Diabetes related ketoacidosis is a rare but serious side effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors and prolonged fasting, acute
illness and the peri-operative period predispose to developing ketoacidosis. In these situations, the ADA-EASD
recommend temporary discontinuation of the medication, i.e., three days prior to surgery.144 Like those with
PAD, a diabetes related foot ulcer or gangrene have a
high risk of developing a foot infection or to undergo
one or more (urgent) surgical procedures, it is suggested
for pragmatic reasons that SGLT-2 inhibitors should not
be started in drug naïve individuals and that temporary
discontinuation should be considered in those already using these drugs, until the affected foot is healed.
Postscript
The targets discussed in this text are based on reduction of cardiovascular events, but it should be noted
that this is a composite endpoint and the deﬁnition between trials differs. MALE is also sometimes differently
deﬁned and the evidence for reducing lower limb events
in persons with diabetes, PAD, and a foot ulcer by pharmacological treatment is scarce. For this reason, a speciﬁc recommendation on this topic could not be made.
