 vein,
AAGSV and PAGSV (when identiﬁed), and SSV at the
SPJ or at the mid-calf, if SPJ is not identiﬁed.65 Measurements of reﬂux in the calf veins is optional. Axial
reﬂux is deﬁned as uninterrupted retrograde venous
ﬂow from the groin to the calf, either to the upper calf
or to the ankle. Superﬁcial reﬂux will be conﬁned to the
superﬁcial venous system, deep reﬂux to the deep
venous system, and combined reﬂux can involve any
combination of the three main venous systems (superﬁcial, deep, perforating). Some investigators have suggested documenting the extent (length) of the
incompetent veins and the distance of the incompetent
truncal vein from the skin.66
Evidence. Several studies have investigated the association of the vein diameter with reﬂux, CEAP clinical
class, and outcome of intervention for patients with
varicose veins.67-74 Kim et al67 evaluated 198 limbs of
99 patients and found that the diameter of the GSV in
the lower thigh with reﬂux >0.5 seconds with rapid
cuff deﬂation in standing patients was signiﬁcantly
larger than that of the GSVs without reﬂux (4.7 mm vs
4.2 mm; P < .001). The cutoff value for the GSV
diameter that was associated with reﬂux in their study
was 5 mm (P ¼ .025).67 Another study from Korea
investigated 777 patients and found 5.05 mm and
3.5 mm to be the best positive predictive value for
reﬂux in the GSV and SSV, respectively.70 Others,
however, found that ablation of small (<5 mm)
symptomatic GSVs provided clinical success in 83% of
the limbs at 3 months, with signiﬁcant improvement
in the venous clinical severity score (VCSS; median
change, 2; interquartile range, 3 to 1).64
