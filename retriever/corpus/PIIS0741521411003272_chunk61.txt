 avoids the need for
deep dissection in the popliteal fossa, with the potential for
associated wound complications or nerve injury.
Cryostripping of the GSV. To decrease hemorrhage
within the saphenous tunnel and avoid any incision placed
at the level of the knee, the technique of cryostripping has
been suggested by some investigators.179 Cryostripping is
an alternative method to invagination stripping.180 The
technique is new in the United States and has not been fully
evaluated.
For cryostripping, a cryosurgical system (Erbokryo CA,
ERBE Elektromedizin GmbH, Tübingen, Germany),
powered by liquid nitrogen, is used. After high ligation is
completed, the cryoprobe is inserted into the saphenous
vein and passed down to the level of the knee. As soon as
the probe tip reaches the desired segment of the GSV,
freezing is initiated. After the freezing cycle is maintained
for a couple of seconds, the GSV is invaginated with an
upward tug and is stripped toward the groin.
Phlebectomy
Ambulatory phlebectomy. Ambulatory phlebectomy
(stab or hook phlebectomy or miniphlebectomy) includes
removal or avulsion of varicose veins through small stab
wounds, made with a No. 11 Beaver blade or a 15° ophthalmologic blade, or through the puncture hole made
with a larger, 19-gauge needle. Avulsion of the varicose
veins is performed with hooks or forceps.172,173 The
most widely known hooks are Müller, Oesch, Tretbar,
Ramelet, Varady, and Dortu-Martimbeau phlebectomy
hooks.172,173,181 The veins are marked before surgery on
the patient’s skin with a marker, with the patient standing.
The operation is usually performed under tumescent local
anesthesia, using a solution of 445 mL of 0.9% saline, 50
