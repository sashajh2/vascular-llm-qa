numbness in the region of the incision in up to one-third
of patients, as well as bulging of the lateral abdominal
wall with muscle atrophy in 7% to 15%.405,727 Transperitoneal repair is associated with a higher incidence of
late small bowel obstruction, and approximately 10% of
patients may develop a ventral hernia within the ﬁrst 6
years after repair, particularly among those who are
obese.728,729 Should a midline incision be used, continuous suturing technique and avoidance of rapidly
absorbable sutures are recommended.730 Wound
infections of the abdominal incisions are rare (0.4%).729
Para-anastomotic aneurysm. Para-anastomotic aneurysms after aortic aneurysm repair include both false
aneurysms resulting from a disruption of the anastomosis and true aneurysms that develop adjacent to the
anastomosis. True metachronous aneurysms occur at a
greater frequency than anastomotic pseudoaneurysms.
However, the incidence of para-anastomotic aneurysms
is not well deﬁned. Predisposing factors include hypertension, COPD, and tobacco use.731-735 In the era before
CT imaging, Szilagyi and colleagues analyzed a 15-year
experience in which anastomoses at the femoral artery
were at highest risk (3%), followed by the iliac artery
(1.2%) and infrarenal aorta (0.2%).734 Subsequent studies
have reported an incidence after open repair of between
4% and 10% at 10-year follow-up.732 In one study of 511
patients, Kaplan-Me
