Recurrent stenosis after CEA seems to have two distinct
patterns of presentation. Early recurrent stenosis usually
develops within two years of primary CEA and typically
results from neointimal hyperplasia.3,417,455 This usually
develops at the site of endarterectomy and is felt to
have a lower thromboembolic potential to cause stroke
than recurrent frank atherosclerotic disease. Therefore,
the threshold for reintervention is high, and these lesions
are typically observed unless they become pre-occlusive
or symptomatic, which is infrequent. Restenoses that
occur after 2 to 3 years after primary CEA typically represent recurrent atherosclerotic lesions.417,455 Indications
for treatment of late recurrent carotid stenosis owing to
atherosclerotic disease are typically similar to those for
de novo carotid lesions.
Before the advent of carotid stenting, repeat carotid
surgery was the standard treatment for symptomatic or
severe recurrent stenosis that required reintervention
for stroke prevention. However, scar tissue in the reoperative ﬁeld can make the operation more technically
demanding, and a higher incidence of CNI and other
complications have been reported.417 However, in general, reoperative carotid surgery can be performed safely,
and has good durability.455
Nevertheless, the increased technical difﬁculty with reoperative carotid surgery has led many to recommend
CAS as the preferred procedure for recurrent carotid stenosis.417 A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of
4399 patients who underwent either redo carotid surgery
or CAS for recurrent carotid stenosis found no differences
in risk of perioperative mortality or stroke.460 Patients
who underwent redo CEA had higher risk of cranial nerve
injuries, but most recovered in three months. However,
risk of a secondary episode of recurrent stenosis was
greater in patients whose initial restenosis was treated
with CAS.
Several studies addressed perioperative and late outcomes of open surgical and endovascular treatment of
post-CEA restenosis
