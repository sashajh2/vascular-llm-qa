, resulted
in ulcer healing in 88% and a low ulcer recurrence of 13% at
21 months.340 Another meta-analysis concluded that perforator interruption used as a part of a treatment regimen for
severe CVI beneﬁts most patients in the short term regarding
ulcer healing and the prevention of ulcer.345
Guideline 6.6: Combined Superﬁcial and Perforator Venous Reﬂux With or Without Deep Venous
Disease and Skin Changes at Risk for Venous Leg Ulcer
(C4b) or Healed Venous Ulcer (C5)
In a patient with skin changes at risk for venous leg
ulcer (C4b) or healed venous ulcer (C5) and incompetent superﬁcial veins that have reﬂux to the ulcer bed in
addition to pathologic perforating veins (outward ﬂow
of >500 ms duration, with a diameter of >3.5 mm)
located beneath or associated with the healed ulcer
bed, we suggest ablation of the incompetent superﬁcial
veins to prevent the development or recurrence of a
venous leg ulcer. [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C] Treatment of the incompetent perforating veins can be performed simultaneously with
correction of axial reﬂux or can be staged with reevaluation of perforator veins for persistent incompetence after correction of axial reﬂux. [GRADE - 2;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
A recent systematic review that included analysis of 12
practice guidelines and four RCTs concluded that perforating
vein interruption should be reserved for patients with large
pathologic perforators with advanced CVI, and evidence suggests no added beneﬁt in patients with less severe disease (C2,
C3).340 The procedure can be performed either combined
with or staged to follow superﬁcial vein ablations, and those
with long-standing and large medial ulcers or recurrent ulcerations have the chance to beneﬁt most. In the North American SEPS registry, factors associated with ulcer healing
included SEPS with concomitant ablation of superﬁcial reﬂux
and lack of deep venous obstruction (P < .05).354,355
