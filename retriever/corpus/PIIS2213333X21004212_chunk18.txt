In the observational studies, 17 studies25,63-66,70-73,
92,95,97,109,110,116,117,119
had an overall low risk of bias, and 11
studies24,62,67-69,93,94,96,98,99,111 had an intermediate risk of
bias. One study61 had a high risk of bias mainly owing to
lack of ascertainment of exposure, comparability, and adequacy of follow-up. Follow-up was adequate for all of
the studies except for ﬁve studies.61,62,65,99,117 Ascertainment of outcomes was arbitrated to be adequate in all
studies (outcomes were ascertained by the clinical
encounter, linkage medical records, or standardized questionnaire assessment). Details of the methodologic quality
of the included studies supporting the overall risk of bias
assessment for each study are summarized in

Key Question 1. DUS examination to diagnose saphenous vein incompetence in patients with varicose veins
(CEAP class C2-C6)
No studies directly compared plethysmography,
computed tomography scan or MR imaging, or venogram to clinical examination or duplex. We included
two comparative observational studies24,25 that included
110 patients (151 limbs), a mean age of 45.5 years, and predominantly women. The primary outcomes were the
incompetence of the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ),

saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ), GSV, which was deﬁned
as (retrograde ﬂow in the GSV of >500 ms).
One study24 had an intermediate risk of bias,
compared DUS with HHD examination (deﬁned as
continuous wave Doppler only with no color or gray
scale imaging or use of pulsed Doppler examination).
The study demonstrated that the sensitivity of the
HHD technique was 73% at the SFJ, 77% at the SPJ,
and 51% for thigh perforators. In primary
