) and European Carotid Surgery
Trial (ECST) clearly demonstrated the efficacy of CEA in
reducing stroke in patients with symptoms of carotid territory cerebral ischemia and carotid bifurcation stenosis that
reduced luminal diameter by ⬎50%.2-4 In these studies, the
risk of stroke was higher in patients with a clear history of

e4 Ricotta et al

carotid territory ischemic events (as opposed to amaurosis
fugax), and stroke risk increased with the severity of stenosis. Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS)
and Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial (ACST)5,6 found
that CEA was also effective in reducing stroke risk in
patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis ⬎60%, although the stroke risk inherent in an asymptomatic stenosis
was much less than that in a symptomatic lesion. It follows
then that neurologically symptomatic patients and neurologically asymptomatic patients at high risk for harboring a
carotid stenosis of ⱖ60% would be candidates for carotid
bifurcation imaging.
A. Indications for imaging the neurologically
symptomatic patient
Typical carotid territory ischemic symptoms include
contralateral weakness of the face, arm, or leg, or both;
contralateral sensory deficit or paresthesia of the face, arm,
or leg, or both; or transient ipsilateral blindness (amaurosis
fugax). If the right cerebral hemisphere is involved, other
manifestations may be noted, including anosognosia, asomatognosia, neglect, visual, or sensory extinction. If the left
hemisphere is involved, patients may show manifestation of
aphasia, alexia, anomia, and agraphesthesia. Symptoms not
typically associated with carotid territory events include
vertigo, ataxia, diplopia, visual disturbances, dysarthria,
nausea, vomiting, decreased consciousness, and weakness,
which may include quadriparesis.
The physical examination may show signs of stroke:
facial/eyelid drooping, motor or sensory deficits, and
speech disturbances. Ocular examinations can occasionally
