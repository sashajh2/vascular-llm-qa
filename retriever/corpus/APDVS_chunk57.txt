D. Aortic disease
E. Tibial artery disease
Answer
E. Tibial artery disease.
Discussion: Risk factors for peripheral arterial disease include age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia, family history, and homocysteinemia. Individuals
who are heavy smokers tend to develop superficial femoral artery disease, whereas those
with diabetes and renal failure tend to develop infrapopliteal disease. Of the answers
listed, only the tibial artery is infrapopliteal.
The following prompt will be used for questions 4, 5, and 6.
A 65-year old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and tobacco abuse presents
to the vascular surgery clinic with complaints of pain in his legs. Patient states that the pain
is crampy in quality, mostly in his calf muscles, it starts after he walks 4 blocks, and is worse
on the right as compared to the left. He notices that when he stops walking, the pain resolves.
This pain is keeping him from being able to participate in social events and spend quality time
with his family.
