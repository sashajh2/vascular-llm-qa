and a far higher risk for women than for men (hazard
ratio, 3.76; 95% CI, 2.58-5.47; P < .001). Rupture risk
was increased in older participants, those enrolled in
earlier studies, those with lower body mass index, and
those with higher mean arterial or pulse pressure. The
effect of any class of drug was difﬁcult to evaluate
because of the low incidence of rupture.9
Thompson and associates performed a metaregression of growth estimates based on aneurysm
diameter (Fig 3) and time to a 10% probability of

attaining an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm (Fig 4).273 Integrating cost-effectiveness data, the authors proposed
recommendations for surveillance intervals based on
aortic size. Several years was recommended for men
with an initial AAA diameter between 3.0 and 4.0 cm,
whereas an interval of 1 year was recommended for
AAAs between 4.0 and 4.9 cm and 6 months for those
between 5.0 and 5.4 cm. However, the presence of diabetes, female sex, and current smoking history were
not accounted for by the model or considered within
this set of recommendations.273 The increased risk of
aneurysm rupture in women and patients with a smoking history has confounded attempts at standardizing
surveillance intervals.
We suggest surveillance imaging at 3-year intervals for
patients with an AAA between 3.0 and 3.9 cm.
