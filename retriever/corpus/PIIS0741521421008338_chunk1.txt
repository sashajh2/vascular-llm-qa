1.23-3.09) and more wound complications (OR, 5.18; 95% CI, 2.19-12.26). There was no statistically signiÔ¨Åcant difference in
primary patency at 3 years (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.97-1.97), secondary patency (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.84-3.03), mortality at the
longest follow-up (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.21-1.17), mortality at 30 days (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.06-1.36), or amputation (incidence rate
ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.56-1.31). The certainty in these estimates was, in general, low. Studies of PAA natural history suggest that
thromboembolic complications and amputation develop at a mean observation time of 18 months and they are frequent.
One study showed that at 5 years, approximately one-half of the patients had complications.
Conclusions: This systematic review provides event rates for outcomes important to patients with PAAs. Despite the low
certainty of the evidence, these rates along with surgical expertise and anatomic feasibility can help patients and
surgeons to engage in shared decision-making. (J Vasc Surg 2022;75:121S-5S.)

Although peripheral artery aneurysms are rare, popliteal
artery aneurysms (PAAs) are the most common type of
peripheral arterial aneurysm with a reported prevalence
rate of 0.007% in men, and 0.001% in women. Patients
with PAAs are at increased risk of concomitant abdominal
aortic aneurysms (33%) and contralateral PAA disease
(50%).1,2 Given the anatomic location of the popliteal
