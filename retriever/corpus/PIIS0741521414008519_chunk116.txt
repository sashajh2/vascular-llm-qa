Guideline 6.14: Proximal Chronic Total Venous
Occlusion/Severe Stenosis With Skin Changes at Risk
for Venous Leg Ulcer (C4b), Healed (C5) or Active
(C6) Venous Leg UlcerdEndovascular Repair
In a patient with inferior vena cava or iliac vein
chronic total occlusion or severe stenosis, with or
without lower extremity deep venous reﬂux disease,
that is associated with skin changes at risk for venous
leg ulcer (C4b), healed venous leg ulcer (C5), or active
venous leg ulcer (C6), we recommend venous angioplasty
and stent recanalization in addition to standard compression therapy to aid in venous ulcer healing and to prevent
recurrence. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]

There is recognition of the importance of iliac vein
obstruction in both primary and post-thrombotic
CVD.175,411,412 Profound proximal obstruction in the iliocaval veins appears to be the predominant hemodynamic
pathophysiologic process compared with peripheral reﬂux
when both exist, although deﬁnitive proof of this has not
been tested. As a result, treatment priority is generally
accorded to the proximal occlusive disease when one is
faced with combined proximal obstruction and distal
valvular reﬂux. Percutaneous iliac and caval vein stenting
has been proved safe, with low morbidity, high patency,
and satisfactory efﬁcacy. Current results demonstrate a cumulative patency rate of 90% with ulcer healing rates of
60% to 80%, depending on the cohort being treated
(Table XIII).173,413-418 Percutaneous iliac and caval vein
stenting has become the preferred technique of many centers for iliocaval and some common femoral vein occlusive/
stenotic conditions, such as the post-thrombotic condition
or that of the May-Thurner primary disorder when it is
technically achievable.419-427 Extension of the iliac vein
