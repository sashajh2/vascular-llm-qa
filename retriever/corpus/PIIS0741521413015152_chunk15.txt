With respect to wound categorization, both the Fontaine14 and Rutherford8 classiﬁcations of lower extremity
ischemia lack sufﬁcient detail. DFU classiﬁcations such as
perfusion, extent/size, depth/tissue loss, infection, sensation (PEDIS),43 University of Texas (UT),34 variants
of sepsis, arteriopathy, denervation (SAD),37,38,40,41 and
St Elian39 offer the beneﬁt of having been validated.
However, most DFU systems fail to provide sufﬁcient
detail with regard to perfusion status and are ulcer systems,
with no speciﬁc mention of gangrene. Gangrene increases
risk of amputation compared with ulceration.44,45,56,58,61-65
Although the Wagner classiﬁcation35,36 includes gangrene, it does not differentiate gangrene because of infection from that resulting from ischemia. It also fails to
characterize the degree of infection, ischemia, or wound
extent. Table I summarizes multiple existing classiﬁcation
systems; strengths and limitations of each system are
noted in the comments column.
