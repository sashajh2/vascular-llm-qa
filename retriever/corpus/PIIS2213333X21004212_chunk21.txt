Pigmentation. HL/S was associated with a lower risk of
pigmentation than RFA (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.83;
I2 ¼ 0.00%; 4 studies39,71,72,104).

Quality of life. No signiﬁcant difference was found in
the disease-speciﬁc QoL score when HL/S compared
with RFA at one month (SMD, e0.03; 95% CI, e0.66 to
0.59; I2 ¼ 77.8%; 2 studies40,58).
Recurrent varicosity. HL/S was associated with a lower
risk of recurrent varicosity compared with UGFS (RR, 0.24;
95% CI, 0.07-0.79; 1 study111).
Outcomes at 1 year.
Anatomic closure. HL/S was associated with lower
anatomic closure rates compared with EVLA (RR, 0.90;
95% CI, 0.83-0.97; I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies104,108), and a
better anatomic closure rates when compared with RFA
(RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.04-1.26; 1 study109). Anatomic closure
failures were described in Rasmussen et al104 as four
stripping procedures that failed because the stripper
perforated the GSV, and the vein could not be accessed
from below. In the series reported by Venermo et al,108
failure was owing to partial occlusion of GSV.
Pigmentation. HL/S was associated with a lower risk of
pigmentation than EVLA (RR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0
