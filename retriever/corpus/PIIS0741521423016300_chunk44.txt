 feasibility of the different
revascularisation options, and their risks.
As discussed in other parts of the IWGDF guidelines,
restoration of perfusion in the foot is only part of the
treatment required to optimise wound healing and to
prevent or limit tissue loss, which should be provided
by a multidisciplinary team.43 Any revascularisation procedure should be part of a comprehensive care plan
that addresses other important issues including: prompt
treatment of concurrent infection, regular wound
debridement, biomechanical ofﬂoading, control of blood
glucose, assessment and improvement of nutritional status, as well as treatment of oedema and co-morbidities.43 The decision to perform a revascularisation
procedure and which procedure is preferred depends
therefore on several factors and in each individual the
balance should be made between expected beneﬁts,
potential risks, harms and costs, in a shared decision
making process. For these reasons a Best Practice
Recommendation was made. The care of persons with
a DFU is frequently managed by healthcare professionals
who are not speciﬁcally trained in the treatment of PAD.
Care for people with PAD is differently organised in many
countries, with different medical disciplines involved,

Recommendation 12
In a person with diabetes, peripheral artery disease, a foot
ulcer, and clinical ﬁndings of ischaemia, a revascularisation
procedure should be considered. Findings of ischaemia
include absent pulses, monophasic or absent pedal Doppler
waveforms, ankle pressure < 100 mmHg or toe pressure < 60
mmHg. Consult a vascular specialist unless major amputation
is considered medically urgent.

Best Practice Statement

Rationale
The natural history of people with diabetes, PAD, and a
DFU or gangrene remains poorly deﬁned, but in two
studies reporting the outcomes of participants with diabetes and limb ischaemia who were not revascularised,
the limb salvage rate was around 50% at one year.73,100
Analysis of the evidence for revascularisation suggests
that revascularisation in appropriately selected people
with diabetes and haemodynamically signiﬁcant PAD,
can improve perfusion, expedite wound healing, and
reduce major limb amputations.6
