 8 RCTs (9
publications)30,31,33,37,39-41,58,60 had a high risk of bias mainly
owing to inadequate randomization, inadequate random
sequence generation, allocation concealment, unclear
blinding of outcome assessors, possible selective reporting,
and other sources of bias such as funding sources; 3
RCTs32,36,42 had a low risk of bias. Ten observational
studies63-66,70-73,109,110 had a low overall risk of bias, ﬁve
studies62,67-69,111 had an intermediate risk of bias, and one
study61 had a high risk of bias owing to lack of ascertainment of exposure, comparability of cohort, assessment of
outcomes, and lack of follow-up. The mean age was
47.5 years, with 65.3% women. Most of the patients had a
CEAP classiﬁcation of C2 to C6 (Supplementary Tables I-III,
online only).
Outcomes at 1 month.
Anatomic closure. HL/S was associated with higher
anatomic closure rates than RFA (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.011.18; 1 study109).
Pain. Compared with endovenous laser ablation
(EVLA), HL/S was associated with lower likelihood of being pain free (RR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.29-0.54; I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2
studies61,69), and increased need for analgesia (RR, 1.83;
95% CI, 1.17-2.86; I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies28,64).
Pigmentation. HL/S was associated with a lower risk of
pigmentation than RFA (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.83;
I2 ¼ 0.00%; 4 studies39,71,72,104).
