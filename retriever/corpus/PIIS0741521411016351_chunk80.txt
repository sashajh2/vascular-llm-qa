combined CAS and CABG (2.4%), with an OR of 1.62
(95% CI, 1.1-2.5).278
If a sequential strategy is planned, CABG may need to
be deferred for 2 to 4 weeks because of the need for
dual-antiplatelet therapy after CAS. This has resulted in

some logistical difficulties in patients who require urgent
coronary revascularization. A meta-analysis of all published
results280 suggested that the stroke/death rate of 9.1% seen
with CAS and CABG is not significantly different than the
results with CEA and CABG. One must conclude that data
are insufficient to support a clear recommendation for
treating patients with unilateral asymptomatic carotid stenosis who need CABG.
‚óè Recommendations for management of combined
carotid and coronary disease
1. Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis will benefit
from CEA before or concomitant with CABG. The
timing of the intervention depends on clinical presentation and institutional experience (GRADE 1, Level of
Evidence B).
2. Patients with severe bilateral asymptomatic carotid stenosis, including stenosis and contralateral occlusion,
should be considered for CEA before or concomitant
with CABG (GRADE 2, Level of Evidence B).
