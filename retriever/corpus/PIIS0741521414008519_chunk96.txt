tic system and showed promise in decreasing VLU healing time in patients who had
previously failed to respond to conservative treatment.313,314 However, this theory remains to be rigorously tested. To date, only 387 patients have been
enrolled in RCTs comparing IPC with other treatment
modalities.36 Whereas it is advantageous to use IPC
compared with no compression therapy, currently there
is limited evidence to suggest that the addition of IPC
to compression therapy offers beneﬁt.315 Thus, the patients likely to beneﬁt most from IPC are those who
cannot tolerate or do not have access to compression

therapy or who have failed to respond to prolonged
compression therapy alone. Further studies need to be undertaken to evaluate the beneﬁt of IPC in this particular
cohort. In circumstances in which IPC is used, there is
some evidence to suggest that proportion of ulcers healed
(86% vs 61% at 6 months; P ¼ .003) is improved with
rapid compared with slow cycling.316
OPERATIVE/ENDOVASCULAR MANAGEMENT
Guidelines for operative and endovascular management are categorized anatomically as superﬁcial venous disease, perforator venous disease, deep infrainguinal venous
disease, and iliocaval disease. Each category can be
managed with open surgical or endovascular techniques.
The rare occurrence of congenital venous disease leading
to VLU and its treatment lacks deﬁnitive reporting.
These guidelines for operative and endovascular management also address the twofold goal of VLU treatment,
which includes ulcer healing and prevention of ulcer recurrence. The separate pathologic processes of primary degenerative reﬂux disease and inﬂammatory thrombotic disease
provide different challenges for the treating physician
because the surgeon or interventionalist must provide a
speciﬁc procedure to correct the pathologic state.
In general, quality of the evidence available to support
recommendations for operative and endovascular management is mostly limited to level C evidence because of an
absence of comparative prospective RCTs of treatment
techniques, with the exception of superﬁcial venous treatments. The strength of the clinical recommendations for
operative and endovascular management can be increased
by concurrence of results from individual case
