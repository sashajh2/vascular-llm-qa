ow through diseased and collateral vessels thereby reducing ischemia and pain.

Physical Exam
Common physical exam findings on the lower extremities include:
 Cyanosis
 Cool Extremities
 Hair loss
 Dry skin
 Muscle atrophy
 Dystrophic toenails (thick toenails)
 Capillary refill > 5 seconds
 Non-palpable distal pulses
 Non-healing wounds

Non-invasive Hemodynamic Testing
In terms of non-invasive testing, as stated above, a combination of ABI and PVR is the gold
standard in establishing a diagnosis. As a review, the ABI is a non-invasive test that compares
blood pressure in the ankle with blood pressure in the arm. ABIs are calculated by dividing
the systolic ankle pressure by the highest systolic arm/brachial pressure (between the two
arms).
An ABI value: - X > 1.2 is non-compressible, calcification of arteries


 0.9 < x < 1.2 is normal
 0.7 < x < 0.9 refects a mild disease burden
 0.4 < x < 0.7 refects a moderate disease burden
 x < 0.4 refects a severe disease burden
Here is an example of ABI/PVR recordings. Patient A (left) shows a normal ABI/PVR
recording, while patient B (right) shows an abnormal ABI with diminished waveforms.
Arterial Doppler ultrasound can also be utilized to evaluate blood fow and detect arterial
stenosis or occlusion.
For a definitive CLTI diagnosis, pain should be present for more than two weeks and associated
with at least one of the following abnormal hemodynamic parametersI:
1. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) < 0.5.
2. Absolute toe pressure (TP) < 30 mmHg.
3. Absolute Ankle Pressure (AP) < 50 mmHg.
4. Transcutaneous pressure of oxygen (TcPO2) < 30 mmHg.
5. Flat or minimal pulsatile volume recording (PVR) waveforms.

Angiography
CT Angiography (CTA) with tri-vessel runoff (i.e. anterior tibial, posterior tibial, peroneal
arteries) of lower extremities can help identify the location(s) of disease. However,
