,98,99,111 had an intermediate overall risk of
bias, and six observational studies92,93,95,97,109,110 had a
low risk of bias. The mean age was 47.5 years, with
59.5% women. Most of the patients had CEAP classiﬁcation of C2 to C6 (Supplementary Tables I-III, online only).
Outcomes at 1 month.
Anatomic closure. EVLA was associated with lower
anatomic closure rates than CAC (RR, 0.90; 95% CI,
0.84-0.97; 1 study75).
Pain. EVLA was associated with a higher VAS pain score
when compared with CAC and UGFS (SMD, 0.76; 95% CI,
0.56-0.96; 1 study76) and (SMD, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.42-0.98;
I2 ¼ 0.00%; 2 studies81,94).
Quality of life. EVLA was associated with worse generic
QoL scores when compared with MOCA and UGFS (SMD,
e22.22; 95% CI, e24.83 to e19.62; 1 study84) and
(SMD, e11.57; 95% CI, e12.31 to e10.84; 1 study101),
respectively. Compared with CAC, RFA was associated
with a worse generic QoL score (weighted mean difference, e17.56; 95% CI, e19.22 to e15.90; 1 study85).

Skin complications. EVLA was associated with an
increased risk of ecchymosis than CAC (RR, 2.17; 95% CI,
1.39-3.37; 1 study76).
Outcomes at 1 year.
Anatomic closure. EVLA was associated with higher
anatomic closure rates than UGFS (RR, 1
