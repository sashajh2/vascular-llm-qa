9; P ¼ .012) and greater than 1.5 times the risk
of stroke (OR, 1.6; P ¼ .008) than vascular surgery patients.
But general surgery patients had less than half the risk of
MI (OR, 0.34; P ¼ .031) compared with vascular surgery
patient. The authors concluded that surgical specialty
was associated with a wide range of postoperative clinical outcomes after CEA.570
Lieber et al571 reported on the impact of surgical specialty on outcomes following CEA. using the National
Surgical Quality Inpatient database that included
42,369 patients across all specialties. Patient demographics were similar between the specialty groups. Results showed that compared with vascular surgeons,
general surgery patients had signiﬁcantly a higher postoperative stroke risk (2.3% vs 1.5%; OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.172.21). However, surgical specialty was not a signiﬁcant
risk factor for 30-day postoperative mortality (0% for
cardiothoracic surgeons; 0.8% for vascular surgeons;
1.1% for general surgeons; and 1.8% for neurosurgeons;
P ¼ .995). Length of stay (P < .001), operative duration
(P < .001), and postoperative requirement for a ventilator
greater than 48 hours (P ¼ .004) were all greatest among
neurosurgeons. The authors concluded that although
there was a difference in postoperative stroke and other
secondary outcomes, no differences in mortality risk
were observed among specialties after CEA.571
AbuRahma et al572 reported on the effect of surgeon’s
specialty and volume on CEA perioperative outcomes
in a retrospective analysis of 953 CEA during a 2-year
period. Surgeons were classiﬁed into general surgeons,
cardiothoracic surgeons, and vascular surgeons, and their
volume was categorized into low volume (<10 CEAs),
medium volume (10 to <30 CEAs) and high volume
($30 CEAs). Perioperative stroke and death risk were
