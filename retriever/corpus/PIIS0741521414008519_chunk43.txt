 important observations

are a family history, female gender, pregnancy, estrogen,
prolonged standing, sitting postures, and obesity. Genetic
conditions, such as Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome, cerebral
autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts
and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) and FOXC2 gene
mutations, desmulin dysregulation, and Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome, display early onset of varicose veins.46,52 However, most individuals with primary venous disease do not
have these genetic conditions, and a speciﬁc gene leading
to primary venous disease and varicose veins has not been
identiﬁed, although it appears that the trait is autosomal
dominant with variable penetrance.52,53 Further studies
have focused on genetic polymorphism in populations
with CVD in the development and healing potential of
venous ulcers.54 Hemochromatosis C282Y (HFE) gene
mutation and certain factor XIII V34L gene variants
have been demonstrated in patients with CVD and varicose veins and may have long-term implications for
increased risk of the more severe forms of CVD as well
as the size of venous ulcers.55,56 Factor XIII is an important cross-linking protein that plays a key role during ulcer healing.57 HFE and factor XIII genes were also
evaluated in predicting VLU healing after superﬁcial
venous surgery in patients with CVD. It was demonstrated that speciﬁc factor XIII genotypes had favorable
ulcer healing rates, whereas the HFE gene mutation,
despite its importance in venous ulcer risk, had no inﬂuence on healing time.58
It is clear from biochemical, immunohistochemical,
and functional studies that both the vein wall and the
valve are involved in the primary events leading to venous
disease. Whether the vein wall changes precede valve
insufﬁciency or the valve insufﬁciency causes wall distention and wall changes is less clear.46 More important, evidence demonstrates that both vein wall and vein valve
are pathologically altered to cause primary venous disease. The perturbation in the microcirculation is a critical
component in the pathoph
