 and high or low porosity. Polyester grafts
can be rendered impermeable by various biologic coatings, including collagen, gelatin, and albumin. Graft
impregnation with silver or rifampin has been used to
enhance resistance to infection. Routine use of
rifampin-impregnated polyester grafts, in which gelatincoated polyester grafts are soaked in rifampin solution
(1 mg/mL) for 15 to 30 minutes, or of silver-impregnated
grafts to limit the risk of device-associated infection has
not proved to be beneﬁcial in prospective or multicenter
studies.414-417
Graft conﬁguration can be a straight tube or bifurcated.

bifurcation, iliac artery, or femoral artery. A tube graft is
preferable when it is feasible because of shortened operative time and reduced blood loss and need for dissection, minimizing risk of inadvertent injury to the ureter,
iliac veins, and autonomic nerves. In the era before widespread adoption of EVAR, approximately 40% to 50% of
patients could be treated with a tube graft.418 In the Canadian aneurysm trial, graft conﬁguration was straight
in 39%, aortobi-iliac in 31%, aortobifemoral in 24%, and
aortoiliac and femoral in 7%.419 Bifurcated grafts are indicated when the distal aorta and common iliac arteries are
aneurysmal, which occurs in one-third of patients.420 In
the presence of iliac aneurysmal disease, the distal
anastomosis should be performed immediately proximal
to the iliac bifurcation to reduce the risk of late
aneurysmal degeneration. Patients with symptomatic
aortoiliac occlusive disease may beneﬁt from distal graft
anastomosis to the distal external iliac or common
femoral arteries. However, graft extension to the femoral
arteries increases
