 of cerebral infarction associated with plaques of
the large extracranial (including the aortic arch) and
intracranial arteries. Stroke owing to perfusion failure
occurs with severe stenosis of the carotid and basilar artery, and when there is microstenosis of the small deep
arteries, the latter being a common cause of lacunar
infarction. In situ thrombosis may also occur owing to
a severely stenotic lesion, plaque rupture, or less
frequently to a prothrombotic state.
Atherosclerotic lesions are not randomly distributed
along the cerebral arterial tree. The carotid artery system
is mostly affected at the common carotid artery (CCA)
bifurcation, the siphon, and the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Along the vertebrobasilar circulation, the ﬁrst and fourth segments of the vertebral
artery and the ﬁrst segment of the basilar artery are
frequently affected. Factors that lead these lesions to
become symptomatic are not well-understood, but stenoses are linearly associated with increased risk of distal
brain infarct. Extra-cranial carotid artery disease

(ipsilateral stenosis of $50%) has been linked to 9% to
36% of ischemic strokes.22,23 Yet, carotid artery plaques
that cause less severe stenosis have a potentially causative association with embolism of undetermined source
(cryptogenic).24

CAROTID IMAGING INDICATIONS
Most experts believe that at least 20% of ischemic
strokes are likely related to extracranial carotid artery
atherosclerosis.3,25 It is for this reason that the goal of
carotid bifurcation imaging is to detect “high-risk” patients with signiﬁcant carotid bifurcation plaque who
would be likely to beneﬁt from therapy to reduce their
stroke risk.3
Many factors drive stroke risk, but among patients with
atherosclerosis of the carotid bifurcation, the most
important seem to be a
