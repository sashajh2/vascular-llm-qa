 with
one stent. The mean lesion treated was 7.1 cm in stent
cohort and 6.4 cm in the angioplasty cohort. The reported
observed patency at 1 year was 81.3% and 36.7%, respectively, for the stent and angioplasty groups.194 In a 3year follow-up of the RESILIENT study, freedom from
target lesion revascularization and clinical success was
signiﬁcantly higher in the primary stent cohort, but no
data were available on patency.210
The Study for Evaluating Endovascular Treatments of
Lesions in the Superﬁcial Femoral Artery and Proximal
Popliteal By Using the Protege EverfLex Nitinol Stent System II (DURABILITY II) trial was a single-arm trial investigating the efﬁcacy of a single self-expanding nitinol stent in
the treatment of occlusive lesions in the SFA >4 and <
20 cm. Duplex-derived primary patency at 1 year was
77.2% for lesions with a mean length of 8.9 cm.211 The Zilver PTX trial randomly assigned 471 patients with SFA lesions averaging 6.5 cm to treatment with a paclitaxel DES
or PTA as a primary procedure and to BMS in a subset of
110 study patients who required further treatment for immediate failure of PTA alone. Patency at 1 year was 83.1%
for DES and 32.8% for PTA. In the 110 patients undergoing
salvage stenting for failed PTA, 1-year patency was signiﬁcantly better for DES compared with BMS (89.9% vs
73%).204 The patency superiority of paclitaxel DES over
PTA (74.8% vs 26.5%) and BMS (83.4% vs 64.1%) was sustained in a 2-year follow-up report of the same study.212
PTFE-covered self-expanding stents have been used to
treat long-segment lesions within the SFA for patients
with claudication, although their superiority to B
