 cost-effectiveness of screening for
younger cohorts, women, and reimaging intervals for
small aneurysms remains uncertain. Early treatment of
a small aneurysm, <5 cm in diameter, is not costeffective in comparison to serial imaging.772
Because of the lower perioperative complication rates
with EVAR, patients who could not undergo open repair
are being offered EVAR or hybrid procedures. In the
setting of constrained costs and capitated care, expensive procedures for asymptomatic elderly patients with
signiﬁcant comorbidities who will not derive a meaningful survival beneﬁt are not cost-effective.

EVAR implants are a major component of costs of treatment. As additional devices have been introduced to the
market, it had been speculated that competition would
lower price and incentivize further innovation. However,
a decrease in device cost has not been observed. Several
institutions have reported that EVAR confers a negative
operating margin in Medicare beneﬁciaries.773,774
Whereas cost-effectiveness results can vary among
different populations of patients and health care systems
and over time, the factors that inﬂuence cost and outcomes remain consistent. In a future of rising costs and
constrained resources, cost-effectiveness analysis will
provide a basis to guide health care policy that sustains
health care coverage for all.

CARE OF THE PATIENT WITH AN AAA: AREAS IN
NEED OF FURTHER RESEARCH
Advances in biotechnology, drug discovery, and the engineering sciences hold signiﬁcant promise for the development of new diagnostic tests, bioactive compounds,
and intraoperative tools and devices that will enhance
the care of the patient with an aortic aneurysm. Research
is needed (1) to ascertain genetic or other biologic factors
that accurately measure the lifelong risk for development of an aortic aneurysm; (2) to discover pharmacologic agents to limit aneurysm enlargement; (3) to
characterize biomarkers or imaging-derived determinants of rupture risk; (4) to design prostheses that resist
infection and thrombosis; (5) to develop tools, intraoperative imaging or robotic systems, and improved endovascular grafts that facilitate repair in
