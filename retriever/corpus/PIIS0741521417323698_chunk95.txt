iologic beneﬁts, including signiﬁcant reduction in
ﬂuid losses, cardiac stress, pulmonary complications, and
ileus. However, prospective randomized studies have
generated conﬂicting results.404,405 The measurable
beneﬁts attributed to retroperitoneal exposure were
primarily a shorter duration of ileus and earlier resumption of oral intake. Sieunarine and colleagues reported no
difference in a randomized comparison of transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches for infrarenal
AAA repair, except for higher rates of incisional pain,
bulge, and hernias in the retroperitoneal group.406
The retroperitoneal approach may be preferred for
repair of a suprarenal aneurysm because exposure can
be facilitated by division of the left diaphragmatic crus.
However, in a majority of patients, repair of juxtarenal
and pararenal aneurysms can be performed using a

transperitoneal approach with excellent outcomes.407,408
Although some surgeons routinely ligate or divide the
left renal vein to expose the suprarenal aorta in the
course of using a transperitoneal approach, others do
not.407,408 An important indication for the retroperitoneal
approach is the presence of a hostile abdomen because
of prior intra-abdominal operations, irradiation, incisional
hernia, stoma, or enterocutaneous ﬁstula. In addition, a
retroperitoneal approach can facilitate repair of an inﬂammatory aneurysm or aneurysm associated with a
horseshoe kidney.409,410
We recommend a retroperitoneal approach for patients
requiring OSR of an inﬂammatory aneurysm, a horseshoe
kidney, or an aortic aneurysm in the presence of a hostile
abdomen.

We suggest a retroperitoneal exposure or a transperitoneal
approach with a transverse abdominal incision for patients
with signiﬁcant pulmonary disease requiring OSR.
