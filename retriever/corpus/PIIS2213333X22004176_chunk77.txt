Evidence. Harlander-Locke et al207 performed a retrospective review of 1000 consecutive RFAs of truncal veins
(916 limbs with class C2-C6). Five hundred seven limbs
had large (>3mm) symptomatic varicose tributaries of
which 355 (70%) underwent concomitant phlebectomy,
145 (25%) limbs had staged phlebectomy. Twenty-six
limbs (5%) did not require staged phlebectomy because
of symptom resolution after saphenous ablation. The
authors concluded that patients with incompetent,
symptomatic tributary veins measuring 3 mm or greater
and axial reﬂux may beneﬁt from endovenous ablation
with concomitant phlebectomy.
Brown et al208 used data from the Varicose Vein Registry from 2015 to 2019 for 3375 C2 patients who had undergone thermal ablation of the saphenous veins.

Patients who had undergone concomitant sclerotherapy
were excluded. Of the 2026 remaining patients, 1013
were included in each of two groups: ablation alone
and ablation with phlebectomy. The preprocedural
VCSSs were similar in both groups. However, the median
improvement in the VCSSs was higher for those who had
undergone ablation and phlebectomy. In addition, the
investigators had examined patient-reported symptoms.
After the procedure, improvement had occurred in all
symptoms (heaviness, achiness, throbbing, swelling, itching, appearance, pain, and effect on work). However, the
change in the scores was higher for the ablation plus
phlebectomy group than for the ablation alone group.
Conway et al209 in a 2020 study of data from the varicose vein module of the American Venous Registry
examined 526 patients with CEAP clinical class C2
without prior venous treatment. Combined treatment
(CT) in this cohort consisted of phlebectomy
