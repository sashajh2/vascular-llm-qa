 disease, including PAD;
however, the relative risk is less for hypertension than for
smoking or diabetes. Treatment of hypertension is indicated
to reduce cardiovascular events, including congestive heart
failure, stroke, and death.76 There is no evidence that badrenergic blockers worsen the symptoms of IC.77
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) reduce
the risk of death and nonfatal cardiac events in patients with
left ventricular dysfunction.78,79 In the Heart Outcomes
Prevention Evaluation study, 4051 patients with PAD treated
with ramipril had a 25% reduction of cardiac events.80 This is
notable, particularly in the context of a recent trial examining
the effects of ramipril on walking performance (Section 4B).
Antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents. Numerous
studies have demonstrated the beneÔ¨Åt of antiplatelet therapy,
especially aspirin, in doses of 75 to 325 mg/d in reducing
rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and vascular-related
deaths in individuals with symptomatic lower extremity
atherosclerosis.81 The American Heart Association practice
guidelines for lower extremity ischemia rated this treatment

recommendation class I-A.43 In the 6452 patients with PAD
in the Clopidogrel vs Aspirin In Patients At Risk of Ischaemic
Events trial, clopidogrel reduced the myocardial infarction,
stroke, or vascular death rate by 23.8% more than aspirin
alone.82 Although a single study demonstrated that combination aspirin and clopidogrel therapy was associated with a
20% relative risk reduction for myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, or stroke,83 there is no evidence to date
that combination therapy is a more effective treatment for
PAD than a single agent, and bleeding risks are increased.84
Warfarin has been demonstrated to reduce myocardial
infarction or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease,
although at the cost of a 4.5-fold increase in major
bleeding.85,86 There is no evidence that warfarin decreases
the likelihood of adverse events related to PAD alone. Only
