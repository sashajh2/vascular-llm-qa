 to the level of the knee. Clinical and ultrasonographic residual varicose veins at 6 months were not significantly related to the presence of preoperative incompetent
perforating veins.
Chronic venous insufficiency (CEAP class C3-C6). The
North American SEPS registry reported the results of SEPS
performed in 17 U.S. centers on 155 limbs, 85% with class
C5 and C6 disease. Ulcer healing at 1 year was 88%, with the
median time to ulcer healing of 54 days.62,350 Ulcer recurrence was 16% at 1 year and 28% at 2 years. This registry
contained data on 27 patients with class C6 disease who
underwent SEPS alone. The ulcer recurrence rate (35%) in
the SEPS-only group at 2 years was not significantly higher
than recurrence in patients who underwent SEPS and superficial ablation alone (25%).
Nelzen363 prospectively collected data from 149 SEPS
procedures in 138 patients, of whom 89% underwent saphenous surgery as well. During a median follow-up of 32
months, 32 of 36 ulcers healed, more than half (19 of 36)
â±•1 month. Three ulcers recurred, one of which subsequently healed during follow-up. In a subsequent series
from the same group, 97 limbs with class C5 and C6 disease
were treated with SEPS. Superficial ablation was also performed in 87%. All patients were monitored for at least 5
years. Ulcers healed in 87%, and the 3- and 5-year recurrence rates were 8% and 18%. Long-term data in 51 limbs
with class C5 and C6 disease were published by Iafrati et
al,364 who performed SEPS alone in 23 limbs and SEPS
with stripping in 28. The ulcers healed rapidly, and the
5-year ulcer recurrence rate was low (13%).
Post-thrombotic patients do worse than those with
primary incompetence. In the Mayo Clinic series, 5-year
ulcer recurrence was 5
