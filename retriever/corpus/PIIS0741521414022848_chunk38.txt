The effect of ramipril on walking performance in patients with IC was originally included but has subsequently been deleted (see Supplementary Material on

5. THE ROLE OF REVASCULARIZATION FOR IC
Patient selection for intervention
The natural history of IC is usually one of a slowly progressive decline in the ability to walk a distance before the
onset of pain. With intensive medical management, <5% of
patients will develop symptoms of advanced ischemia, such
as ischemic rest pain and tissue loss, or will ultimately
require amputation.9,122 The relatively benign natural history of claudication must be weighed against the effect of
the loss of ambulatory function on activities of daily living,
occupation, and QoL. Consequently, the decision to intervene should be individualized, taking into consideration
these factors as well as the clinical response to noninterventional therapies, and
