Varicose veins were listed in the inclusion criteria of
some of the trials (eg, Capelli121), most of them
focusing on CVI with CEAP class from C2 to C5. Data
quality was heterogeneous, but the study concluded
that Ruscus extracts signiﬁcantly improved symptoms
compared with placebo. The best effects were
observed on leg heaviness (P ¼ .001), pain (P ¼ .02),
cramps (P ¼ .025), and paresthesia (P ¼ .031). Venous
capacity, assessed by plethysmography, decreased by
0.7 mL/100 mL compared with placebo (P ¼ .014).
Comparison with hydroxyrutoside and MPFF showed
similar effects on the symptoms. A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis16 included 10 highquality, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs with a
total number of 719 patients (CEAP C2-C5). Compared
with placebo, the RR for pain was 0.35 (P < .00,001),
for heaviness 0.26 (P < .00001), for sensation of
swelling 0.53 (P < .0001), for paresthesia 0.27 (P <
.0001), and for global symptoms 0.54 (P < .00001).
Ankle circumference and leg volume were signiﬁcant
reduced, and the study concluded that Ruscus extracts were effective in reducing symptoms and
edema in patients with CVD.16 In a meta-analysis,112
