illary permeability, although a precise mechanism of action of most of these
drugs is unknown. Flavonoids appear to affect leukocytes
and the endothelium by modifying the degree of inflammation and reducing edema.56
A recent Cochrane review of 110 publications selected
44 well-documented studies for analysis.132 The metaanalysis found that there appeared to be an effect on edema
and on restless leg syndrome. Diosmin, hesperidin, and
MPFF have been the most effective venoactive drugs. Calcium dobesilate reduced cramps and restless legs. Diosmin
and hesperidin helped healing of trophic skin changes and
were useful in treatment of cramps and swelling. Rutosides
decreased venous edema. This meta-analysis, however,
concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the
global use of venoactive drugs in the treatment of CVD.132

We recommend that the revised Venous Clinical Severity Score is used for
assessment of clinical outcome after therapy for varicose veins and more
advanced chronic venous disease.
We recommend that quality-of-life assessment is performed with a
disease-specific instrument to evaluate patient-reported outcome and
the severity of chronic venous disease.
We recommend duplex scanning for follow-up of patients after venous
procedures who have symptoms or recurrence of varicose veins.
We recommend reporting procedure-related minor and major
complications after therapy.

Horse chestnut seed extract. A separate Cochrane
review of 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found
that horse chestnut seed extract (aescin) was effective to
decrease edema, pain, and itching.129
