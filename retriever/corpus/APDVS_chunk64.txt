 tender
of extensor hallucis longus. It plays a crucial role in supplying blood to the dorsal surface
of the foot and the toes. The presence and palpability of the dorsalis pedis pulse are

foot.
In summary, the common femoral artery is the arterial origin of the leg. It gives rise to the
superficial femoral artery, and subsequently, the popliteal artery. The popliteal artery then
divides into the anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries, each supplying specific
regions of the leg and foot. Understanding this anatomy is crucial for diagnosing and treating
arterial diseases and vascular disorders in the lower extremities.

Here is a review of the lower extremity vascular anatomy and here are two sample diagnostic angiograms of these vessels (Sample 1, Sample 2).

Process of Atherosclerosis
As previously mentioned, atherosclerosis is a fundamental process that underlies the development of peripheral vascular disease in the lower extremities. The pathological process is
precisely the same as with carotid disease leading to increasing stroke risk and coronary artery
disease leading to increased risk of cardiac events.
Atherosclerosis is a progressive, infammatory condition characterized by the accumulation
of fatty deposits, cholesterol, infammatory cells, and fibrous tissue within the inner layers
of arteries, forming plaques. The process typically begins with damage or dysfunction of the
endothelial lining of the arterial walls. This can be caused by risk factors such as hypertension,
smoking, or high cholesterol levels. In response to endothelial injury, low-density lipoproteins
(LDL) or “bad” cholesterol molecules penetrate the arterial wall and become oxidized. These
oxidized lipids trigger an infammatory response. The body’s immune system responds to the
infammatory signals by sending white blood cells (macrophages) to the site. These cells engulf
the oxidized lipids and form foam cells within the arterial wall. The infammation leads to
the proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Over time, the combination of lipids, immune cells,
and smooth muscle cell proliferation results in
