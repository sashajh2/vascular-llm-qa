GSV, Great saphenous vein; SSV, small saphenous vein.

For treatment of recurrent or residual veins due to
IPVs, several techniques of IPV occlusion were reported (Table XXI). Park et al used EVLA to occlude
the saphenous vein that had retrograde ﬂow from
an IPV of the thigh in 69 patients.229 This RCT
concluded that direct IPV treatment was not justiﬁed
since the technical success of the perforator ablation
was signiﬁcantly lower than just closure of the GSV
(76.5% vs 100%). The outcomes were not different
for either clinical success or complications between
the two groups (one with direct IPV treatment, one
without). FS for IPVs has also been analyzed in
conjunction with GSV ablation in a prospective trial231;
at 6 months it showed a closure rate of 75% for IPVs
vs a 98% closure of GSV. A prospective trial on 296
IPV closures in 112 patients compared three methods
(RFA, EVLA, and FS); most patients had C5 or C6
disease.223 Closure success was signiﬁcantly better
with RFA (73% P¼ .05) vs FS (57%), but failed to reach
signiﬁcance vs EVLA (61% P ¼ .09). More recently, a
technique for cyanoacrylate closure of perforating
veins was described in a retrospective series of 83
patients with C2 to C6 disease (27% C2 patients).
IPV closure rates were excellent, 96 % at 16 days
and 86% at 72 days. There were no DVTs, but
one patient needed antibiotic treatment for septic
thrombophlebitis.224

In summary, there is little to no randomized data for
the perforator treatment of choice for patients with
recurrent/persistent C2 disease, with an associated
IPV. When treatment of an IPV in a C2 patient is
desired, one should rely on experience, patient wishes,
and the availability of the various techniques reviewed
above.
