 the emphasis of
this guideline was on varicose vein management. In 2012,
SVS and AVF clinical practice guidelines addressing early
thrombus removal strategies for acute venous thrombosis
were published.24 Again, whereas there is some crossover
regarding the impact of early venous thrombosis on
restored venous patency, potential preserved valvular
function, and decreased post-thrombotic morbidity, there
was little direct attention on VLUs. The objective of the
current SVS and AVF clinical practice guidelines is to focus
on complete management of VLUs at all levels of care
based on strength and quality of supporting evidence to
guide speciﬁc recommendations. Combined with these
other SVS and AVF clinical practice guidelines, a more
complete evidence-based strategy is available for management of patients with chronic venous disease.

METHODOLOGY OF VENOUS LEG ULCER
GUIDELINES
The Institute of Medicine, in Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust, has deﬁned clinical practice guidelines
as “systematically developed statements to assist the practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate healthcare
for speciﬁc clinical circumstances.”25 The underlying principle is to use evidence-based medicine to the greatest
extent to develop these guidelines so that the assessment
of the optimal treatment plan is based on the best current
available knowledge. Evidence-based medicine allows one
to assess the statistical strength of a treatment or intervention and, most important, reduces bias in evaluating a
particular therapy.26 Bias is deﬁned as the predisposition
of prejudice toward either the experimental or control
group, which can lead to either an overestimation or an underestimation of the true beneﬁts and harm of the intervention.27 This method reduces uncertainty, which is the
largest single cause of misinterpretation of data.28 This
process has been further stated in the recent Institute of
Medicine document: “Hence, critically appraised and synthesized scientiﬁc evidence has become fundamental to
clinical practice. At the same time, and particularly under
conditions of uncertainty regarding optimal decisions,
clinician experiential knowledge and skill (the “art of medicine”) and patient values and preferences remain essential
contributors to quality healthcare practice, in a
