0.4% vs 2.3% 6 0.6%; HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.18-1.11; P < .08);
however, the differences were not signiﬁcant. The CSTC
(Carotid Stenosis Trialists’ Collaboration) performed a
meta-analysis of 4754 patients from the four randomized
trials comparing CEA and TF-CAS. These investigators
demonstrated a CEA vs TF-CAS periprocedural HR of 1.61
(95% CI, 0.90-2.88), in favor of CEA for patients aged 65
to 69 years and an HR of 2.09 (95% CI, 1.32-3.32) for patients aged 70 to 74 years.37 If octogenarians (>80 years)
were removed from the data to allow the CREST ﬁndings
to be compared with those from other trials in which such
patients were not enrolled, the results demonstrated that
the 30-day stroke and death rate was signiﬁcantly lower
for patients undergoing CEA (2.6% 6 0.7% for CEA and
5.6% 6 1.0% for CAS; P ¼ .006).37 The pooled analysis of
30-day outcomes of stroke and death were lower for
symptomatic patients treated with CEA vs TF-CAS14 (Fig 1).
The long-term outcomes of CAS vs CEA for symptomatic patients were examined using a preplanned pooled
analysis of individual patient data from the EVA-3S,
SPACE, ICSS, and CREST studies.38 These four trials randomized a total of 4754 symptomatic patients with
>50% internal carotid artery stenosis. The median length
of follow-up was 2 to 6.9 years. The risk of stroke or death
within 120 days of the index procedure was 5.5% for CEA
and 8.7% for CAS (risk difference, 3
