 stenosis greater than 50% internal carotid stenoses
were randomized to daily aspirin (325 mg) or placebo. At a
median follow-up of 2.3 years, there was no signiﬁcant differences between groups in incidence of any ischemic event or
death.113 Conversely, in the Asymptomatic Carotid Emboli
Study that focused on patients with a 70-99% asymptomatic stenosis, antiplatelet therapy was associated with lower
rates of ipsilateral stroke/TIA and any stroke/cardiovascular
death.114 In addition, a multicenter stroke registry of 10,433 individuals of whom 1914 (18.3%) were taking aspirin, aspirin
use was associated with reduced stroke severity and
improved functional outcome.115
Several studies offer strong evidence supporting the efﬁcacy of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention
among patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease116-122 and a meta-regression analysis of 11 trials
demonstrated an approximate 15% reduction in stroke
risk associated with aspirin use.123 Because patients
who have experienced a symptomatic episode are at
greatest risk of a second event in the ﬁrst few days after
the initial event, it is important to initiate antiplatelet
therapy as soon as possible. In a meta-analysis
comparing aspirin vs control that included 12 randomized clinical trials with nearly 16,000 patients, at 6 weeks
there was a 60% decrease in the risk of recurrent stroke
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.32-0.55, P < .0001)
and a 70% decrease in the risk of a fatal stroke (HR,
0.29; 95% CI, 0.2-0.42; P < .0001).124

Breakthrough ischemic events may occur in some patients who are compliant with aspirin therapy owing to
aspirin resistance. There is some
