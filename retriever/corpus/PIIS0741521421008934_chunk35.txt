 to be signiﬁcant independent predictors of
$80% stenosis: female sex, peripheral vascular disease,
a history of TIA or stroke, a positive smoking history,
and the presence of left main coronary disease. If all patients with at least one of those risk factors were
screened, the mathematical model predicted that 95%
of the patients with $80% stenosis would be identiﬁed
before their cardiac operation.84
Lin et al85 reported the outcomes of 3233 patients
who had undergone cardiac surgery. They performed
comparisons between those who had undergone preoperative carotid duplex ultrasound scanning (n ¼
515) and those who had not (n ¼ 2718). No difference
was found in the risk factors or a history of previous
TIA between the two cohorts. Among the patients
who had undergone screening with ultrasound before
isolated CABG (n ¼ 306), the incidence of signiﬁcant
disease was relatively low: 25 (8.2%) had had unilateral
moderate (50%-69%) stenosis, 10 (3.3%) bilateral moderate stenosis, 9 (2.9%) unilateral severe (70%-99%) stenosis, 2 (0.7%) bilateral severe stenosis, 5 (1.6%)
unilateral total occlusion, and 1 (0.3%) bilateral total

occlusion. The outcomes regarding perioperative mortality and stroke did not differ between those who
had and those who had not undergone duplex ultrasound. Operative intervention of severe carotid stenosis
before CABG was performed in 2 of 17 patients identiﬁed (11.8%).85
When the results of these two studies were combined
in a systematic review and meta-analysis, screening in
these deﬁned populations did reveal a beneﬁt with regard to the mortality outcome and less so for the stroke
outcome (Fig 4). Additionally, the systematic review
revealed that certain patient cohort populations might
be expected to have an approximate prevalence of
$20% of signiﬁcant carotid artery stenosis even if asymptomatic, making them appropriate to consider for
screening (Fig 5)14:
