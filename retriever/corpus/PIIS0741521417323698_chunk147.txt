 was insufﬁcient to recommend an optimal frequency of surveillance. Magnetic
resonance imaging was more sensitive than CT angiography and contrast-enhanced CT, although the difference
was small. Duplex ultrasound was inferior to CT and
contrast-enhanced ultrasound in terms of detection rate,
although leaks missed on ultrasound did not require intervention or were not considered to be clinically signiﬁcant.

The goal of postoperative surveillance is to prevent late
rupture and aneurysm-related death. After OSR, an anastomotic aneurysm or aneurysmal dilation in the adjacent
visceral aorta or iliac arteries may occur in 1%, 5%, and
20% of patients at 5, 10, and 15 years.732,735 Thus, abdominal and pelvic CT imaging is recommend every 5 years
after OSR.
Surveillance after EVAR is performed to identify sac
growth, endoleak, device migration, or device failure. A
comprehensive analysis of contemporary Medicare patients revealed that the incidence of late rupture 8 years
after EVAR is >5%.364 Unfavorable anatomy for endovascular repair predisposed to most ruptures, which developed from type I or type III endoleaks with sac
enlargement.743-745
Surveillance imaging modality. Initially recommended surveillance protocols were consistent with those
used by FDA-sponsored pivotal trials, with CT imaging
at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months and yearly thereafter. The 6-month CT scan can be eliminated from
routine surveillance if the 1-month scan shows no concerning endoleak or sac enlargement.746,747
Color duplex ultrasound, contrast-enhanced color
duplex ultrasound, and three-dimensional contrastenhanced ultrasound have all been shown to be accurate in detecting type I and type III endoleaks as well
as sac enlargement.748-752 Ultrasound eliminates radiation exposure, reduces cost, and avoids use of a nephrotoxic contrast agent. Further surveillance with ultrasound
is safe if CT imaging 1 year after EVAR demonstrates no
endoleak and stable sac size747,752 or for those patients
with a type II endoleak and a stable aneurysm size.751 A
