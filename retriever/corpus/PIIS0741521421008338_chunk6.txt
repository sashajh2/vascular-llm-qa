 of
study selection. Thirty original studies in 31
publications10-20,22-34,36-42 were included in the quantitative synthesis comparing OAR and EVAR. These
studies included 5381 patients with mean age range of
63 to 68 years; 91.6% of patients were male (descriptive
data are from studies that reported outcomes per
patient, not per aneurysm). All studies were nonrandomized,11-20,22-34,36-42 except for one randomized
trial.10 Supplementary Table II (online only) includes the

Supplementary Table III (online only) includes the evaluation of the risk of bias of these studies. We also identiﬁed three systematic reviews that reported the
outcomes of reintervention rate, wound complications,
and hospital length of stay.43-45 These analyses were
deemed adequate and the most recent dataset43 was
used to extract these outcomes (14 studies, 4880
aneurysms). In terms of natural history outcomes, we
identiﬁed an existing systematic review of 13 surgical
case series (437 aneurysms)1 and 2 additional series with
additional 399 aneurysms.21,35
Comparison of open vs endovascular approaches. A
meta-analysis showed that, compared with EVAR, OAR
was associated with higher primary patency at 1 year (OR,

difference in primary patency at 3 years, secondary patency,
mortality, or the amputation rate. The open approach was
associated with lower embolic and thrombotic occlusions
at 30 days (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.24, 0.68). Forest plots are in
