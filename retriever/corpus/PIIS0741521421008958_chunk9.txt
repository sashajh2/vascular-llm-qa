demonstrated that, at the 3.3-year follow-up, medical
therapy was associated with signiﬁcantly higher risk of
stroke/death (RR, 5.81; 95% CI, 1.38-24.45; Supplementary
Table I, online only). After 5 years of follow-up, medical
therapy was associated with a higher risk of stroke (ACST
200411) (RR, 2.86; 95% CI, 2.02-4.03; Supplementary
Table I, online only) and ipsilateral stroke (ACST 200411)
(RR, 4.77; 95% CI, 2.63-8.64) (Supplementary Table I,
online only). Certainty in these estimates was moderate
to high. The estimates for the outcomes of death, stroke,
stroke/death, MI, and ipsilateral stroke at the 1-year
follow-up were reported by Reiff et al13 and were highly

imprecise to derive conclusions. A meta-analysis was not
feasible on stroke outcomes owing to the heterogeneity
of reporting and follow-up durations.
Howard et al107 conducted a systematic review and
meta-analysis that analyzed the correlation between
the degree of asymptomatic carotid stenosis and ipsilateral stroke in patients treated with contemporary
best medical therapy. The ipsilateral stroke rate was
signiﬁcantly greater for patients with 80% to 99% carotid stenosis than those with 50% to less than 80%
stenosis (18% vs 1%; P < .0001). Patients with 70% to
