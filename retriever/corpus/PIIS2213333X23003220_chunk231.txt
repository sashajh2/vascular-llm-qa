 (7 RCT).
Evaluation of the leg volume change in 6 placebocontrolled trials reported a 32.1 mL weighted mean difference (95% CI, 13.49-50.72) in favor of horse chestnut
extract. This efﬁcacy was found comparable to
compression stockings in another trial.301 The treatment
safety was excellent. The authors concluded that “horse
chestnut extract is an efﬁcacious and safe short-term
treatment for CVI.” The most recent systematic review
and meta-analysis on VAD effectiveness15 conﬁrmed
value of horse chestnut extract therapy, although the
other VAD were found more effective, MPFF in reducing
leg volume and pain, and improving QOL; calcium
dobesilate and Ruscus extracts in reducing foot volume
and ankle circumference.
Clinical beneﬁt of red vine leaf extract.
Rationale. Red vine leaf extract was found to improve
cutaneous microcirculation in patients with CVI, thanks
to the increased nitric oxide synthase and decreased
oxidative stress.302
Evidence. A review paper estimated a statistically signiﬁcant and clinically relevant efﬁcacy of red vine leaf
extract.303 on leg edema reduction assessed by

volumetry, and on symptoms (heaviness, tingling and
pain). Three double-blind vs placebo RCTs support these
ﬁndings. One304 crossover trial vs placebo, in 71 patients
with CVI Widmer grade I to II, reported a signiﬁcantly
decreased leg circumference (P < .0001) and an
increased cutaneous microvascular blood ﬂow (P <
.0001) as well as transcutaneous oxygen pressure (P <
.0001). Another RCT, in 260 patients CEAP C2 to C4,305
evaluated leg volume by water displacement volumetry
and noted marked dose-dependent difference favoring

circumference pattern (P < .
