 has been used to treat a GDAA. At
6 months, the Cardiatis stent was patent with complete
thrombosis of the aneurysm sac.227 Patients are treated
with dual antiplatelet regimens postoperatively. In patients with suitable anatomy, ï¬‚ow-diverting, multilayered
stents may become a treatment option for GDAA and
PDAA, although these have not been adequately studied
to be recommended as a primary treatment modality at
this point.
Open surgical treatment of GDAA and PDAA is technically feasible with a perioperative morbidity and mortality for nonruptured aneurysms of approximately 9.4%
and 1.3%, respectively.59 Techniques include ligation
and excision with end-to-end anastomosis.59,211,212,223
However, mortality for ruptured GDAA and PDAA undergoing open repair approaches 30%.4,209
Celiac axis stenosis or occlusion is frequently associated
with aneurysms of the pancreaticoduodenal arcade.228

Few data exist regarding screening for GDAA and
PDAA. However, based on the fact that celiac stenosis
is associated with 50% to 60% of these aneurysms, it
would seem prudent to examine the gastroduodenal
artery and pancreaticoduodenal arcade by either
duplex ultrasound or CTA once a celiac stenosis is
diagnosed.232 Pulsed Doppler ultrasound can distinguish between aneurysms and other masses of the
pancreas, although it may be limited by patient factors
such as bowel gas.233
There is no association of GDAA or PDAA with aneurysms outside the visceral circulation. Therefore,
screening for concomitant aneurysms outside the
abdomen is of little value.
It is well known that endovascular treatment of GDAA
and PDAA may be associated with the long-term
complication of aneurysm reperfusion.6,209 Although no
studies have evaluated the recurrence rates of GDAA or
PDAA after endovascular co
