 The risks associated with bilateral HA occlusion are restricted to more severe, persistent, and
frequent
buttock
claudication
and
erectile
dysfunction.341
Technical considerations that may reduce the incidence of adverse events when bilateral HA embolization
is required include a staged approach, embolization of
only the proximal main trunk of the HA, and preservation
of collateral branches from the common and deep
femoral arteries.329,340 An alternative consideration to
avoid bilateral HA embolization during EVAR is open or
endovascular revascularization of at least one internal
iliac artery.342,343 FDA-approved iliac branch graft devices
to maintain ipsilateral internal iliac perfusion have been
developed or are under review.344-346 These devices
have displayed satisfactory early outcomes and should
be considered before embolization in appropriate
circumstances.
With the advent of endovascular repair techniques,
the continued necessity of maintaining pelvic blood
ﬂow has been called into question. Several clinical series have used internal iliac artery embolization as an
adjunct to extend the indications of EVAR in patients
with aneurysms involving the iliac bifurcation. Mehta
and associates reported no mortality or increased
morbidity in 48 patients who had interruption of
both internal iliac arteries during open or endovascular
aortic repair.338 However, buttock claudication and
new-onset erectile dysfunction were noted in 42%
and 14% of the patients, respectively. The incidence of
postoperative sexual dysfunction and buttock claudication varies widely in the literature, ranging from 16% to
50% for unilateral and 16% to 80% for bilateral internal
iliac artery embolization, underscoring the difﬁculty of
causal association in the setting of signiﬁcant comorbidities present in the older patient demographic at
risk for AAA disease.347 Several endovascular techniques have been described to preserve internal iliac
artery ﬂow, including the development of commercially
available aortoiliac endografts that incorporate an iliac
branch.348-351
