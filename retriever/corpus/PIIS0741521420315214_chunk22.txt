are variably associated with wall thinning, loss of elastic
and muscle ﬁbers in the aortic media, accumulation of
mucopolysaccharide cysts between the ﬁbers, and subsequent wall expansion. Common risk factors include
hypertension and connective tissue disease. Atherosclerosis, on the other hand, is typically characterized by
intimal plaques composed of variable combinations of
ﬁbrous tissue and lipid with calciﬁcation. Inﬂammation
manifested by the accumulation of macrophages and
lymphocytes and their secretory products contributes
to the progression of disease.
Aortic vasculitides and inﬂammatory diseases. Inﬂammatory aortitis is characterized by the presence of
inﬂammation of the adventitia and media.34 Histologic
ﬁndings may show thickened adventitia with inﬁltration
of adventitia and media with clusters of plasma cells and
lymphocytes.
Takayasu (necrotizing) aortitis usually is manifested as
panaortitis with granulomatous inﬂammation and stenosis of the aortic arch and its major branches.34 Initially,
the inﬂammation is around the vasa vasorum and at the
medial-adventitial site and advances into the intima.
Rapid and severe inﬂammation can lead to the loss of
smooth muscle cells and may advance to produce aortic
arch syndrome, segmental stenosis, occlusion, and aneurysm. Disintegration of elastic ﬁbers is prominent, as are
reactive ﬁbrosis and increased ground substance within
