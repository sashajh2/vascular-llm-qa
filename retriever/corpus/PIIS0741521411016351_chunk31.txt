cholesterolemia and incident stroke is less clear. A metaanalysis of 45 studies of strokes in patients with hypercholesterolemia did not suggest an increased risk for stroke in
patients with elevated serum cholesterol.113 However, several other prospective studies in men and women have
subsequently identified an increase in incident stroke associated with elevated cholesterol levels.114-116
Patients with known atherosclerosis have demonstrated
reduced stroke rates when treated with lipid-lowering therapy. The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial of statin
therapy in hypercholesterolemic patients observed that
greater reductions in levels of low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) were associated with a reduction in stroke risk. A

e10 Ricotta et al

meta-analysis of 26 trials observed that the risk of stroke
decreased by ⬎15% for every 10% reduction in serum
LDL117 in patients with known coronary or other atherosclerosis.
Further meta-analyses of statin trials that also reported
on stroke as an outcome have shown that statin therapy
reduces the risk of stroke by 15% to 30%.118 The Stroke
Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol trial
found that atorvastatin treatment of patients with a recent
stroke or TIA resulted in a reduction in stroke rate by 16%
over 5 years.119
It is less clear if aggressive lipid-lowering therapy results
in regression of carotid artery atherosclerosis. Aggressive
statin therapy in the Measuring Effects on Intima-Media
Thickness: an Evaluation of Rosuvastatin study,120 the
Arterial Biology for the Investigation of the Treatment
Effects of Reducing Cholesterol121 study, and the Atorvastatin vs Simvastatin on Atherosclerosis Progression122
study all showed increased regression of the carotid artery
intima-media thickness compared with controls.
Although LDL is the primary determinant of cardiovascular and stroke risk, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol also influence stroke risk, and elevation of HDL has been shown to reduce the risk of
stroke.123 In an analysis of a large (⬎9200) series of patients, treated by dual therapy
