 EVLA. At
1 year, however, EVLA was associated with higher
anatomic closure rates than UGFS (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.111.37; I2 ¼ 0.00%).133,177,185 Compared with physiciancompounded UGFS, EVLA and RFA were also associated with a lower risk of recurrence (RR, 0.18; 95% CI,
0.05-0.59; and RR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01-0.44, respectively). In
the CLASS study, UGFS using physician-compounded
foam had resulted in a lower anatomic closure rate
(RR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.89-4.49) and an increased risk of reinterventions at 1 and 5 years.10 At 5 years, the diseasespeciﬁc QoL was better for EVLA than for UGFS.10 The
scores for the generic QoL measures were similar.5
A British RCT, reported by Lattimer et al176 found that
physician-compounded UGFS was 3.15 times less expensive than EVLA (£230.24 vs £724.72) with comparable
effectiveness. However, 56% (vs 6%) of the patients who
had undergone UGFS had required additional treatment. Although the potential for reintervention was
clearly higher owing the higher rates of recanalization after UGFS, when performed with physician-compounded
foam, this technique remains an important tool because
of the much lower cost and easy availability, compared
with other catheter-based techniques. Long-term results
and comparative studies with PEM are needed.
Early adverse events were reported to be more frequent
after EVLA or RFA than after CAC (Table III).92,188 Some
clinical advantages of CAC compared with thermal techniques for #1 year, have been demonstrated in several
reports.92,172,179,188 However, a prospective study by Ay
et al150 found that the
