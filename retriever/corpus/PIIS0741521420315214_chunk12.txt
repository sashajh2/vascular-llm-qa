 routine. Level of
recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 28: We recommend pre-emptive
superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenting with a
balloon-expandable stent in cases of >50% stenosis of
the SMA in the following conditions: before or after celiac
artery (CA) coverage or encroachment, with TEVAR that
is encroaching on the SMA origin, or in any patient otherwise considered at high risk for post-TEVAR mesenteric
ischemia. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong),
Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 29: In anticipation of high risk for CA
territory ischemia (nonvisualization of CA collateral
branches by CTA or dedicated SMA angiography), we
recommend open or endovascular revascularization of
the CA before TEVAR. Level of recommendation: Grade
1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 30: If an open approach for access is
used, we recommend transverse or oblique incisions in
performing open femoral access for TEVAR. Level of
recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 31: We recommend using ultrasound guidance for percutaneous access to improve procedural success and to decrease the rate of major
complications. Level of recommendation: Grade 1
(Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 32: We recommend that percutaneous access for TEVAR is safe and an acceptable alternative to open common femoral artery exposure if
certain anatomic criteria are met (eg, diameter of common femoral artery, lack of front wall calcium). Level of
recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)
Recommendation 33: We recommend the use of iliac
conduits or direct iliac/aortic punctures for TEVAR delivery to facilitate access in patients with small (relative to
the chosen device), tortuous, or calciÔ¨Åed iliac vessels.
The decision to perform a conduit should be made in
the preoperative setting, when possible. Level of recommendation: Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B
(Moderate)
