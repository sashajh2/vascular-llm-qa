 vascular laboratory for CVD, isolated nonsaphenous origin reﬂux was found in 84 (10%).228 Ninety
percent of these limbs were CEAP class 1 t 3. Thigh perforators were found in 36 limbs (43%, although only 53% of
these demonstrated reﬂux) while 8% of limbs had reﬂux
arising from the vein of the popliteal fossa, and 4% from
knee or posterior tibial perforators.

Evidence/panel input

Judgment

How substantial are desirable
effects of the strategy?

Recommendations for superﬁcial venous intervention over
compression for patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the GSV or SSV are based on the Cochrane
Review for compression effectiveness and two comparative
randomized trials with consistent results.

Yes

How substantial are the
undesirable anticipated
effects?

Possible side effects are related to the surgical interventions.
However, these interventions are considered as safe with low
rate of complications.

Probably yes

Do the desirable effects
outweigh the undesirable
effects?

Probably

GSV, Great saphenous vein; SSV, small saphenous vein.

For treatment of recurrent or residual veins due to
IPVs, several techniques of IPV occlusion were reported (Table XXI). Park et al used EVLA to occlude
the saphenous vein that had retrograde ﬂow from
an IPV of the thigh in 69 patients.229 This RCT
concluded that direct IPV treatment was not justi
