ned, but in two
studies reporting the outcomes of participants with diabetes and limb ischaemia who were not revascularised,
the limb salvage rate was around 50% at one year.73,100
Analysis of the evidence for revascularisation suggests
that revascularisation in appropriately selected people
with diabetes and haemodynamically signiﬁcant PAD,
can improve perfusion, expedite wound healing, and
reduce major limb amputations.6 After a revascularisation procedure, most studies report limb salvage rates
of 80 e 85% and ulcer healing in > 60% at 12 months.101
On the other hand, performing a revascularisation is not
without risks. As summarised in the systematic review
performed by the IWGDF in 2019,101 the peri-operative
or 30 day mortality rate was around 2% in people with
diabetes undergoing either endovascular or surgical
revascularisation.101 The highest risk group includes
