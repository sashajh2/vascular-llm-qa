 reducing cerebral perfusion. In fact, the
Joint National Committee for the Prevention, Detection,
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure-VII has
remained ambiguous regarding recommendations for
antihypertensive management in patients with a recent
stroke.103 However, antihypertensive therapy aimed at reducing blood pressures to ⬍140/90 is recommended for
patients who have had an ischemic stroke or TIA and are
beyond the hyperacute period.100
B. Treatment of diabetes mellitus
In the Cardiovascular Health Study, an elevated fasting
glucose level was associated with an increased risk for stroke
in patients with carotid atherosclerosis.107 The Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study108 and the Atherosclerosis
Risk in the Community study109 showed that diabetes was
associated with intima-media thickness of the carotid artery
and with progression in intima-media thickness. The
United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS),110
the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes
(ACCORD)111 study, and the Action in Diabetes and
Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled
Evaluation (ADVANCE)112 trial all tested whether tight
control of serum glucose levels in diabetic patients would
reduce the risk for stroke. Despite achieving hemoglobin
A1C levels ⬍6.5%, no reduction in stroke risk was identified
in these trials. Glucose control to nearly normoglycemic
levels (target hemoglobin A1C ⬍7%) is recommended
among diabetic patients to reduce microvascular complications and, with lesser certainty, macrovascular complications other than stroke.
C. Treatment of lipid abnormalities
The relationship between elevated cholesterol and incident MI in patients with coronary artery atherosclerosis is
well established; however, the relationship between hypercholesterolemia and incident stroke is less clear. A metaanalysis of 45 studies of strokes in patients with hypercholesterolemia did not suggest an increased risk for stroke in
patients with elevated serum cholesterol.113 However, several other prospective studies in men and women have
subsequently identified an increase in incident stroke associated with elevated cholesterol levels.114-116
Patients with known atherosclerosis have demonstrated
reduced stroke rates when treated with
