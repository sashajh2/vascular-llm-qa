 by Myers and Jolley,264 thromboembolic
complications occurred in 3%. Knipp et al268 observed a
DVT rate of 2.2% in patients who underwent EVLA with
phlebectomy or perforator ligation and a thrombus extension rate into the femoral veins of 5.9%. When EVLA alone
was performed, there was 0% true DVT but a high thrombus extension rate (7.8%) into the femoral vein. The riskadjusted thrombosis prevention protocol in this study had
no effect on thrombus extension rate into the femoral vein.
Puggioni et al246 observed a 2.3% rate of thrombus extension into the femoral vein after EVLT.
Laser treatment of the SSV may result in sural nerve
paresthesia, with an incidence of 1.3% in the series of
Huisman et al.267 Superficial thrombophlebitis developed
in 6 of 169 patients (3.5%) in this study, but serious
complications did not occur.
Laser wavelength, radial fiber, and efficiency. Evidence to support the efficiency of higher-wavelength vs
lower-wavelength laser fibers has been controversial. A
prospective, randomized, single-center, single-surgeon
trial evaluated lasers with 810- or 980-nm wavelengths.243
Thirty legs were treated for each group by a surgeon
blinded for the type of laser. Patients in the 980-nm group
showed less bruising than those in the 810-nm group (P ‚¨ç
.005). Saphenous occlusion rates at 1 year, however, were
identical, and no major complications occurred in either
group. Studies by Proebstle et al240 and Pannier et al,269
however, suggest that laser light with longer wavelengths
(1320-nm Nd:YAG laser, 1470-nm diode laser) may reduce adverse effects without compromising abolition of
reflux.
Another recent development is the introduction of the
ELVeS Radial Fiber, a fiber with a radial emitting laser tip
