SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Is CEA recommended over maximal medical therapy for asymptomatic carotid stenosis in low surgical risk patients?
1.1. For low surgical risk patients with asymptomatic
carotid bifurcation atherosclerosis and stenosis of
>70% (documented by validated duplex ultrasound or CTA/angiography), we recommend CEA
with best medical therapy instead of maximal
medical therapy alone for the long-term prevention of stroke and death. Level of recommendation: grade 1 (strong); quality of evidence: B
(moderate).
2. Is CEA recommended over TF-CAS for low surgical
risk patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis of >50%?
2.1. We recommend CEA over TF-CAS in low- and
standard-risk patients with >50% symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Level of recommendation: grade
1 (strong); quality of evidence: A (high).

3. What is the optimal timing of carotid intervention
for patients presenting with acute stroke? Management of acute neurologic syndrome:
3.1. In patients with recent stable stroke (modiﬁed Rank
