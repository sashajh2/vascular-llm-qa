 ablation
because the data are indeterminate and the
nonthermal group is heterogeneous

Unknown

How substantial are the undesirable
anticipated effects?

Unclear difference in outcomes; thermal
interventions could be associated with lower
generic QoL scores and an increased risk of adverse
events compared with CAC or n-butyl
cyanoacrylate, but the evidence is uncertain

Small

Do the desirable effects outweigh the
undesirable effects?

e

Probably no

Is there important uncertainty or variability
about how much people value the main
outcomes?

Uncertainty exists regarding the value patients place
on procedural pain vs closure rates or long-term
QoL; these leave the available expertise of the
treating physician and preference of the patient as
important components of the decision

Possibly important
uncertainty or
variability

What is the overall certainty of the evidence
of effects?

e

Very low when
comparing the two
strategies; moderate
for either strategy

Unknown

Unknown

How large is the incremental cost relative to
the net beneÔ¨Åt?

Some data suggest that CAC might not be as costeffective as other ablation techniques; cost factors
do remain important in some settings and are an
important part of the decision-making process

Unknown

What would be the effect on health
inequities?

No data available; allowing physicians and patients
to determine which might be the better route
should help minimize inequity

Unknown

Is the option acceptable to key stakeholders?

No data available

Probably yes

Is the option feasible to implement?

Prior RCTs do suggest that choosing between
thermal and nonthermal options is often feasible

Probably yes

How large are the resource requirements
associated with the intervention?

CAC, Cyanoacrylate closure; QoL, quality of life; RCT, randomized controlled trial.

How substantial are the desirable
anticipated effects of the strategy?

Not substantial; intervention for IPVs does not improve
hemodynamic status, clinical presentation, or QoL
