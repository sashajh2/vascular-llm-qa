 might be of beneﬁt.73 Multiple societies, including the American College of Cardiology Foundation and others, have recommended
screening for asymptomatic patients with a carotid bruit
found on physical examination and for those for whom
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is planned.74 The
SVS has advocated for consideration of carotid artery
screening of high-risk patients aged $55 years with cardiovascular risk factors.75
Several groups have attempted to further reﬁne and
identify the population subsets for whom the prevalence
of carotid stenosis is $20%, which would possibly justify
screening of asymptomatic patients. In a report of a
single-institution screening program, a model identifying
patients at high risk of $50% asymptomatic stenosis was
proposed. The patients screened were >60 years old and
had had one or more of the following risk factors: hypertension, CAD, current cigarette smoking, and/or a
ﬁrst-degree family member with a history of stroke. The
prevalence of signiﬁcant stenosis was only 2% if none of
these risk factors were present but increased dramatically with the coexisting presence of additional risk factors. The prevalence of carotid stenosis was 14% with
two risk factors, 16% with three risk factors, and 67%
with four risk factors.76 In another analysis from the
same institution, patients with both hypertension and
known cardiac disease of any type had a prevalence of
carotid stenosis of $50% of 22.1%.77
Similarly, a report from the Western New York stroke
screening program identiﬁed the following variables to
