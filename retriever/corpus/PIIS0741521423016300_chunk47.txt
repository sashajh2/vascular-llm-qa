such as vascular surgeons, angiologists, interventional radiologists, nephrologists, cardiac surgeons, and cardiologists. For this reason, the term vascular specialist
consultation is used in the recommendation, but whatever the organisation of care all people with diabetes
and PAD should have access to both bypass surgery
and endovascular procedures.

Recommendation 14
In a person with diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and a foot
ulcer with infection or gangrene involving any portion of the
foot, urgently consult a vascular specialist in order to determine the timing of a drainage procedure and a revascularisation procedure.

Recommendation 13
In a person with diabetes, peripheral artery disease, a foot
ulcer, and severe ischaemia i.e., an ankle brachial index < 0.4,
ankle pressure < 50 mmHg, toe pressure < 30 mmHg or
transcutaneous oxygen pressure < 30 mmHg or monophasic
or absent pedal Doppler waveforms, urgently consult a
vascular specialist regarding possible revascularisation.

Rationale
Severe ischaemia is deﬁned in the GVG as an ABI <
0.4, AP pressure < 50 mmHg, TP < 30 mmHg or
TcPO2 < 30 mmHg or monophasic or absent pedal
Doppler waveforms.20,84 Such perfusion deﬁcits are,
as also stated in the GVG, an indication for revascularisation, unless contraindicated
