capita cigarette consumption in American adults has
been paralleled by a similar decline in deaths from
ruptured AAA (Fig 1).49
Estimates of the incidence of death from ruptured AAA
have declined by >50% in the last 20 years, probably
because of multiple factors including declining cigarette
consumption, increased public awareness of AAA disease, improved surgical outcomes and access to treatment afforded by endovascular repair techniques, and
general improvement in management of cardiovascular
disease risk factors.50-52 However, in countries where
cigarette consumption remains high or is increasing,
aneurysm-related mortality continues to increase.53
Although the risk of inhaled, vaporized nicotine from
e-cigarettes and similar nicotine delivery devices has
yet to be determined, multiple investigations suggest
that exposure to nicotine alone may promote the development and progression of an AAA.54-56
Risk factors for rupture are also relevant in evaluating
and managing patients with a known or suspected
AAA. In the UK Small Aneurysm Trial (UKSAT), the annual
risk of rupture was 2.2%. Factors signiﬁcantly and independently associated with rupture included female
gender, large initial aneurysm diameter, low forced expiratory volume in 1 second, current smoking history, and
elevated mean blood pressure.57,58 Multiple studies
have suggested that women are at greater risk for
rupture,59,60 as are patients receiving immunomodulatory therapy after major organ transplantation.61-63
Women who smoke are at high risk for an AAA. In a
recent Swedish population study, women with a history
of smoking of >20 pack-years were nearly twice as likely

to develop AAA as men with a similar smoking history.64
However, the risk of AAA after smoking cessation
declines more rapidly in women than in men.64
