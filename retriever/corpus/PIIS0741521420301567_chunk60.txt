3. Treatment options
Recommended criteria for invasive intervention in gastric and gastroepiploic aneurysms
Recommendation
3.1

We recommend endovascular embolization for Ô¨Årst-line treatment of gastric
artery and gastroepiploic artery aneurysms

Surgical management has historically relied on simple
arterial ligation or excision without reconstruction, whereas
intramural aneurysms required a wedge excision of
involved gastric wall.2,56,87,140 Contemporary literature

Recommendation

Strength of
recommendation

Quality of
evidence

5.1

We suggest interval surveillance (ie, every 12-24 months) with axial imaging
(ie, CTA or MRA) in cases of segmental medial arteriolysis in light of
reported cases of rapid arterial transformation.

B (Moderate)

5.2

We suggest postembolization surveillance every 1 to 2 years with axial
imaging to assess for vascular remodeling and evidence of aneurysm
reperfusion.
