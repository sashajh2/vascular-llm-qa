PAA repair

Meta-analysis of 14
studies, including
4880 PAA repairs
(OPAR, 3915; EPAR,
1210)

OPAR had longer LOS (SMD, 2.158; 95%
CI, 1.225-3.090; P < .001) and fewer
reinterventions (OR, 0.275; 95% CI,
0.166-0.454; P < .001); primary
patency was better for OPAR at 1 and
3 years (RR, 0.607 [P ¼ .01]; RR, 0.580
[P ¼ .006], respectively); no difference
in secondary patency at 1 and 3 years
(RR, 0.770 [P ¼ .458]; RR, 0.642
[P ¼ .073], respectively)

Recommendation 5: We recommend that intervention for thrombotic and/or embolic complications of PAA be stratiﬁed by the severity of
ALI at presentation. We recommend that patients with mild to moderate ALI (Rutherford grade I and IIa) and severely obstructed
tibiopedal arteries undergo thrombolysis or pharmacomechanical intervention to improve runoff status, with prompt transition to
deﬁnitive PAA repair. We recommend that patients with severe ALI (Rutherford grade IIb) should undergo prompt surgical or
endovascular PAA repair, with the use
