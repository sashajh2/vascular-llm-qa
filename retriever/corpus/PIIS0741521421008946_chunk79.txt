In contrast, Al-Rawi et al266 reported results supporting
primary (direct) closure. In this study, the 30-day perioperative stroke risk was similar for microscopic patch angioplasty (3.9%) and direct arteriotomy closure (2.9%). In

7 RCTs
1281 CEAs (1193 patients)

Patch angioplasty associated with reduction in:
Ipsilateral stroke (1.6% vs 4.8%; P ¼ .001)
Any stroke (1.6% v 4.5%; P ¼ .004)
Stroke/death (2.5% vs 6.1%; P ¼ .07)
Arterial occlusion (0.5% vs 3.6%; P ¼ .0001)
Long-term follow-up reduction in:
Ipsilateral stroke (1.6% vs 4.8%; P ¼ .001)
Any stroke (1.9% vs 5.9%; P ¼ .0009)
Stroke/death (14.6% vs 24%; P ¼ .004)
Late post-CEA stenosis (4.8% vs 18.6%; P <
