beneﬁt for VLUs. Microcirculation assessment may be useful as an adjunct for mixed arterial and VLUs, when there is
concern for adequate microcirculation related to other
medical conditions involving capillary perfusion, or for
monitoring of advanced wound therapy.142-144
Guideline 3.9: Venous Duplex Ultrasound
We recommend comprehensive venous duplex ultrasound examination of the lower extremity in all patients with suspected venous leg ulcer. [GRADE - 1 ;
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B]
For a leg ulcer to be classiﬁed as a VLU, there needs to
be objective documented evidence of venous disease. Ultrasound assessment needs to include evaluation for both
obstructive and reﬂux patterns of venous disease. Whereas
continuous-wave Doppler ultrasonography can be used,
comprehensive color ﬂow venous duplex ultrasound
including B-mode gray-scale imaging, pulsed Doppler sampling, and color ﬂow analysis has improved diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility and is the preferred ﬁrst-line
diagnostic test for all patients with suspected VLU.145-148
Comprehensive venous duplex ultrasound evaluates for
both venous obstruction/DVT and venous reﬂux and includes the following components: direct visualization of
deep, superﬁcial, and perforator venous anatomic segments;
compressibility; phasic venous ﬂow with and without
augmentation maneuvers; and documentation of venous
reﬂux with measurement of valve closure time.149,150
Venous obstruction is present when thrombosis is directly
visualized, noncompressibility of vein segment is present,
phasic venous ﬂow is absent with and without augmentation
maneuvers, and extensive collateral vessels are present
around the segment. To identify valvular incompetence, a
portion of the venous duplex ultrasound examination should
be performed in the upright or standing position. Augmentation maneuvers include Valsalva maneuver for common
femoral vein and saphenofemoral junction and use of
manual or cuff compression/release placed distal to the
point of examination for lower extremity veins below the
femoral junction.151,152 Most studies suggest criteria for
valvular incompetence when valve closure time exceeds
