 of
aortic stent placement down to the bifurcation and then
kissing stents placed at the iliac vessel origins.153,154 The
use of aortic stent grafts for occlusive disease142 has been
described in only limited situations, and the routine use
of this approach awaits further data acquisition.

Caution should be exercised in the treatment of AIOD
where concomitant aneurysm disease is also present. If an
aneurysm is of sufﬁcient size to meet treatment guidelines,
therapy should be primarily guided by appropriate aneurysm
exclusion with concomitant restoration of unimpeded blood
ﬂow to the lower extremities. In the case of small aneurysms,
any treatment considered for symptomatic AIOD should
achieve simultaneous aneurysm exclusion or not impede
any future open or endovascular aneurysm repair options.
