ablation is low, with the combined incidence of ARTE,
DVT, and pulmonary embolism (PE) being 1.3% to
1.7%.234-236 Given this low incidence, the potential

magnitude of effect of any intervention such as routine
ultrasound surveillance after venous ablation would be
classiﬁed as “trivial” to “small” (<5 events per 1000

Evidence/panel input

Judgment

How substantial are desirable effects of
the strategy?

Overall, there was a moderate Quality of Evidence to determine
whether MPFF or Ruscus are effective in symptomatic patients with
varicose veins for treatment of vein related pain, leg heaviness and/or
sensation of swelling.

Yes

How substantial are the undesirable
anticipated effects?

Main side effects are mild gastro-intestinal disturbances potentially
alleviated by administration with a meal.

Probably
no

Do the desirable effects outweigh the
undesirable effects?

Probably

Yes

What is the overall certainty of the
evidence of effects?

Moderate, as most of the studies address the cohort of patients with
Chronic Venous Disease and varicose veins patients are only part of
them

Moderate

How large are the resource requirements
associated with the intervention?

MPFF or Ruscus nutritional supplements are not expensive and
available in the US

Low

How large is the incremental cost relative
to the net beneﬁt?

No available data for the varicose veins

Unknown

What would be the effect on health
inequalities?

None

None

Is the opinion acceptable to key
stakeholders?

No data available

Probably
yes

Is the opinion feasible to implement?

Yes

Yes
