 potential venous outﬂow obstruction, diagnosis should be conﬁrmed by contrast
venography and intravascular ultrasound. Imaging with
intravascular ultrasound with cross-sectional views of the
vein and adjacent structures has high diagnostic accuracy
in determining presence of iliocaval thrombus burden or
iliocaval compression due to May-Thurner syndrome or
other adjacent structures, which may have bearing on additional therapeutic options.181-183
Guideline 3.12: Venous Disease Classiﬁcation
We recommend that all patients with venous leg ulcer be classiﬁed on the basis of venous disease classiﬁcation assessment, including clinical CEAP, revised
Venous Clinical Severity Score, and venous diseasee
speciﬁc quality of life assessment. [BEST PRACTICE]
Accurate classiﬁcation of venous disease is critically
important for standardization of venous disease severity
and assessment of treatment effectiveness. Classiﬁcation
systems for reporting of venous disease severity have been
in existence for many years, with recent emphasis on
both patient- and physician-generated assessment tools
that can be used to follow clinically deﬁned end points
and changes over time.
The Clinical class, Etiology, Anatomy, and Pathophysiology (CEAP) classiﬁcation, introduced in 1994 and revised
in 2004, forms the basis for CVD documentation, and should
be used for all patients with VLUs.184-186 The basic CEAP
classiﬁcation (Table V) is a simpliﬁed version of the more
comprehensive CEAP and is recommended for clinical practice, with the more comprehensive CEAP reserved for
research purposes. Whereas the CEAP classiﬁcation system
