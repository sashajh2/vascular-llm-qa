ectomy or bypass
surgery who are not at high risk of bleeding should be
considered for aspirin (75 e 100 mg daily) and low dose
rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) to reduce the risk of
MACE and MALE. Those persons undergoing infrainguinal
bypass surgery with autogenous vein who are not at high
bleeding risk may be considered for treatment with
vitamin K antagonist to improve graft patency.137,142
Those undergoing infrainguinal bypass with a prosthetic graft may be considered for single antiplatelet
therapy. Persons at high risk of bleeding undergoing
lower extremity bypass surgery using an autogenous or
prosthetic conduit may be considered for single antiplatelet therapy to improve graft patency.137
Arterial duplex scanning post-autologous vein bypass
surgery is generally advised post-procedure to detect
graft stenoses. The beneﬁts of post-procedure surveillance following endovascular intervention remain uncertain; following local protocols is suggested.

Glucose lowering therapies. In recent years it has
become increasingly clear that several sodium glucose
cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon like
peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1) agonists, which were originally
developed to lower blood glucose levels, can also have
beneﬁcial cardiovascular effects in persons with type 2
diabetes.21 These effects are independent of their blood
glucose lowering effect. To what extent this beneﬁt can
also be observed in those with type 1 diabetes mellitus, in
whom glucose management with these drugs only has a
limited (SGLT-2 inhibitors) or no (GLP-1 agonists) role to
play, remains to be established. In individuals with an
eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2, these drugs are contraindicated. Therefore, it is advised to consider these drugs
in type 2 diabetes mellitus and peripheral artery disease
with an eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73m2 after careful review
and possibly adjustment of other blood glucose lowering
medication to prevent hypoglycaemia, but for SGLT-2
inhibitors there are additional caveats.
