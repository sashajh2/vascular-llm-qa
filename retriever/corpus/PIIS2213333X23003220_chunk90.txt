allergic reaction to cyanoacrylate,168 while other scoping
and systematic reviews and meta-analyses showed lower
phlebitis rates after cyanoacrylate treatment of truncal
veins vs thermal ablations.23,24,169 There was a large heterogeneity in these trials and patients represented
encompassed the entire spectrum of CVD (CEAP Class
2-6).
There was no difference in phlebitis rates, when
mechanochemical ablation was compared with EVLA
in the LAMA trial occurring in 7% (5/69) after EVLA
compared with 13% (9/69) after MOCA (P ¼ .262).170 In
a retrospective trial with 979 limbs, Obi et al171 found,
not surprisingly, more asymptomatic phlebitis in patients who underwent RFA plus transilluminated powered phlebectomy as compared with RFA alone.
Combined therapy of endovenous thermal ablation
with polidocanol endovenous microfoam (PEM) sclerotherapy also had higher incidence of phlebitis than
thermal ablation combined with placebo sclerotherapy
(18/79 vs 0/30).172
5.2.9. In patients with uncomplicated C2 disease (no
venous claudication, thigh swelling, or suprapubic or
abdominal wall varicosities) due to concurrent superﬁcial incompetence and iliac or iliofemoral venous
obstruction, treatment of superﬁcial incompetence
ﬁrst is indicated.
