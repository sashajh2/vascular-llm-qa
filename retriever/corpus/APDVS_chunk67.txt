 is closely associated with PAD due to hyperglycemiainduced endothelial dysfunction and microvascular damage. It accelerates atherosclerosis by promoting lipid abnormalities, systemic infammation, and the development of
neuropathy, which can mask or delay the recognition of PAD symptoms.
 Hypertension: Hypertension is a major contributor to PAD. Elevated blood pressure
damages arterial walls, rendering them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. Hypertension
also increases the risk of thrombosis and clot formation, further compromising arterial
perfusion.
 Hyperlipidemia: High levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are a known
risk factor for PAD. Elevated LDL cholesterol leads to the accumulation of lipid deposits
in arterial walls, initiating the atherosclerotic process. Dyslipidemia management, particularly the reduction of LDL cholesterol, is essential in PAD prevention and management.
 Age: Age is an independent risk factor for PAD. As individuals age, atherosclerotic
processes accumulate, contributing to a higher likelihood of PAD development.
 Family History: Genetic predisposition can infuence an individualâ€™s susceptibility to
PAD. A family history of vascular disease, particularly atherosclerosis, can confer a
higher risk.
 Obesity: Obesity is one of the multifactorial contributors to the formation of PAD.
Excess adipose tissue is associated with insulin resistance, chronic infammation, and
altered lipid profiles. These factors contribute to atherosclerosis and PAD development.
 Physical Innactivity: A sedentary lifestyle not only contributes to obesity but also
reduces overall vascular health. Regular physical activity, conversely, is associated with
better arterial function and can mitigate PAD risk.
 Diet: A diet rich in saturated and trans fats, along with a low intake of fruits and
vegetables, promotes the development of atherosclerosis. In contrast, diets emphasizing
heart-healthy components, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean protein, are
associated with reduced PAD risk.
 Metabolic Syndrome: Metabolic syndrome, which encompasses a cluster of conditions
such as obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia, is a potent risk factor
for PAD. The interplay of these factors significantly increases the risk of atherosclerosis
and impaired arterial perfusion.
 Gender and Menopause: Men generally exhibit a higher prevalence of PAD, although
the risk in women increases post-menopause
