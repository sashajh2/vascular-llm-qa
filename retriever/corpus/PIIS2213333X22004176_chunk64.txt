 of 550) and 92.8%

(482 of 520) of the PEM- and EVLA-treated patients during an average follow-up of 3 years. No neurologic or cardiac adverse events had occurred after PEM treatment.
PEM appears to be a promising new technology; however, the only RCT currently available had compared endovenous microfoam with placebo to conﬁrm its safety and
early efﬁcacy.100
For treatment of the incompetent below-the-knee
segment of the GSV, a systematic review by Sussman
et al195 found that thermal ablation had had a lower

incidence of saphenous nerve injury compared with high
ligation and saphenous stripping. Endovenous below-the
knee thermal ablations in some studies were used with
good results,196 and an RCT had failed to show any nerve
injury caused by below-the-knee EVLA.197 The recent results with nonthermal ablation, however, appeared
promising because no saphenous or sural nerve injury
had been reported by Jimenez et al154 after ablation of
49 below-the-knee GSVs and 23 SSVs using commercially prepared endovenous microfoam.
In summary, both thermal and nonthermal ablation
techniques are safe and effective; however, we cannot
recommend one technique over the others. All techniques have resulted in improved QoL scores and good
clinical effectiveness at 3 to 5 years after the procedure.
The early beneﬁt of nontumescent, nonthermal procedures over thermal ablation include less pain and discomfort; however, the decreased anatomic closure rates for
the MOCA procedure at 3 years and for UGFS with
physician-compounded foam at 5 years have made
them less durable treatment compared with thermal
ablation. It should be noted, however, that CAC was noninferior to thermal ablation at 5 years in one study.12 Prospective comparative studies with endovenous
microfoam are needed to conﬁrm the long-term clinical
efﬁcacy and a decreased incidence
