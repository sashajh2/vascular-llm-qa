 to determine the degree of stenosis in the SMA and CA may vary by vascular
laboratory and the speciﬁc imaging equipment, underscoring the importance of local validation. In a more
recent study by AbuRahma and colleagues,53 the most
accurate determination of a 50% or greater SMA stenosis
was a fasting PSV of 295 or higher (accuracy 88%, NPV
84%, PPV 91%) and for a 70% or greater stenosis, it was
400 cm/s or more (accuracy 85%, NPV 85%, PPV 84%).
For the CA, a 50% or greater stenosis correlated with a
PSV of 240 cm/s or higher (accuracy 86%) and a 70%
or greater stenosis with a PSV of 320 cm/s or more (accuracy 85%). The DUS velocities used to determine the degree of stenosis can also be affected by the presence of
collaterals and by respiration.54,55 An extensive collateral
network, as often seen in the presence of an SMA or CA
occlusion, can lead to increased ﬂow velocities in the
other, unaffected mesenteric vessels, suggesting a significant stenosis when one is not actually present.54 Similarly, signiﬁcantly high peak systolic and diastolic
velocities were found during expiration (vs inspiration),
thus, potentially impacting the accurate assessment of
the degree of stenosis.55
The IMA can serve as an important collateral when the
other mesenteric vessels have signiﬁcant occlusive disease. Unfortunately, the published experience with DUS
for the IMA is fairly limited. One study comparing DUS
imaging with angiography demonstrated that a greater
than 50% stenosis of the IMA was associated with a
greater than 250 cm/s PSV with an accuracy of 95%,

whereas an IMA to aortic PSV ratio of greater than 4.0
had an accuracy of 93%.56 A second study used greater
than 200 cm/s as the criteria for a greater than 50% stenosis, but
