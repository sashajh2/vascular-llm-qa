id stenosis, but the effectiveness over
medical therapy is not well-established.
There are conﬂicting data on the inﬂuence of contralateral occlusion on CEA or transfemoral CAS outcomes.
NASCET reported that a contralateral occlusion
increased risk of stroke after CEA from 5.8% to approximately 14%.33 However, most reports on contralateral occlusion do not support this observation, and a metaanalysis suggested a much more modest increase, from
2.4% to 3.7%.192,193 Although this increase in stroke risk
was statistically signiﬁcant, the results remain within
AHA recommended guidelines. Several single-center
studies have shown excellent results in patients with
contralateral carotid occlusion.194,195 A possible explanation for this discrepancy may be linked to inadequate
sample sizes in the single-center studies. Alternatively,
more consistent intraoperative management techniques, including algorithms for maintaining intraoperative cerebral perfusion, are more likely to occur in a
single-center experience than in multicentered studies.5
AbuRahma et al196 reported on perioperative and late
stroke rates of CEA contralateral to carotid artery occlusion. In a trial of 399 CEAs with randomization done by
arterial closure method, 49 patients had contralateral
carotid artery occlusion (group A) and 350 patients
did not (group B). Strokes were designated as contralateral if they arose from the occluded side and ipsilateral
if they arose from the same CEA side. Risk of all strokes
(operative and late) and perioperative strokes was 4.1%
and 2% (2% contralateral and 2% ipsilateral) for group
A and 3.4% (all ipsilateral) and 2.9% for group B (P ¼
.85 and P ¼.60, respectively). The risk of all neurologic
events (stroke and TIA) and perioperative events was
18.4% and 2% for group A and 9.7% and 5.4% for group
B (P ¼ .113 and P ¼.27, respectively). At
