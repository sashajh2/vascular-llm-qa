 show significant benefit. In this study, 86% of the
patients had medial or recurrent ulcers. On the basis of
these data and results of a previous RCT by Stacey et al,369
the evidence summary of O’Donnell19 concluded that further properly conducted RCTs are needed to provide highquality evidence of efficacy of perforator interruptions in
patients with leg ulcers. Previous AVF recommendations
agreed with this statement.370
A recent meta-analysis of SEPS by Luebke and Brunkwall32 reviewed data of studies published between 1985
and 2008 and concluded that SEPS, used as part of a
treatment regimen for severe CVI, benefits most patients in
the short-term regarding ulcer healing and the prevention
of ulcer recurrence. SEPS is safe and has less early postoperative complications compared with the classic Linton
procedure. Luebke and Brunkwall also concluded that further prospective RCTs are needed to define the long-term
benefits of SEPS.
Hemodynamic improvement after SEPS with superficial ablation was confirmed by Padberg et al,127 who per-

We recommend against selective treatment of incompetent perforating veins in
patients with simple varicose veins (CEAP class C2).
We suggest treatment of “pathologic” perforating veins that includes those
with outward flow of ⱖ500-ms duration, with a diameter of ⱖ3.5 mm,
located beneath healed or open venous ulcer (class C5-C6).
For treatment of “pathologic” perforating veins, we suggest subfascial
endoscopic perforating vein surgery, ultrasonographically guided
sclerotherapy, or thermal ablations.
