 Although very low LDL
levels are perhaps not achievable in all, LDL reductions
of up to 50% can be achieved in many with the aforementioned potent statins (and ezetimibe), with marked
reduction in cardiovascular risk.16
Additional therapies
Antithrombotic therapy. The subsequent advice on
antiplatelet therapy is in line with the recent ESVS antithrombotic guidelines.137 All guidelines strongly recommend treatment with a single antiplatelet agent in
persons with symptomatic cardiovascular disease, or
more speciﬁcally chronic limb threatening ischaemia
(CLTI). These drugs reduce the risk of cardiovascular
events; for the increased risk of gastric bleeding in aspirin
treated individuals, a proton pump inhibitor as additional treatment should be considered. There is less
consensus regarding which drug to choose, clopidogrel
or aspirin. The ADA and ESC-EASD guideline advises
aspirin as ﬁrst choice in persons with diabetes and a
cardiovascular event but did not specify for the presence
of PAD.18,21 In the recent ESVM, ESC-ESVS, and GVG
guidelines, clopidogrel is considered as the antiplatelet
agent of choice in those with PAD. This recommendation
is in particular based on The Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in
Patients at Risk for Ischaemic Events (CAPRIE) trial, in
which clopidogrel was more effective in reducing cardiovascular risk without an increased risk of bleeding.133
It should be noted that only a subset of participants in
this trial had PAD, of which only 21% had diabetes. Also, a
meta-analysis did not show any beneﬁt from aspirin for
those with PAD.134 A post hoc subanalysis of the CAPRIE
trial showed that clopidogrel was superior to aspirin in
reducing recurrent ischaemic events in those with diabetes.135 The relative risk reduction was comparable with
those without diabetes, but due to the greater number
of events among people with diabetes, the absolute risk
reduction was even larger. Given the potential beneﬁt, it
is suggested in a Conditional Recommendation that
clopidogrel should be considered as ﬁrst choice, in line
with the aforementioned guidelines.
