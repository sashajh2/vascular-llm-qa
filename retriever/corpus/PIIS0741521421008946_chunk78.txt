 remains somewhat controversial.259-285 However, most authorities agree that in a small carotid artery
(#4 mm), particularly in women, and in the presence of
technical difﬁculties at the ICA end of the arteriotomy,
patching may decrease the risk of future restenosis. It
has been suggested that a ﬂow characteristic of patched
arteries may be superior to those of primary closure for
minimizing
early
perioperative
carotid
thrombosis.283,286,287 Other investigators have attributed this

improvement to widening the artery with a corresponding reduction of intimal hyperplasia.288 Therefore, many
suggest that CEA with patch angioplasty decreases the
chance of technical errors. It has been shown to be
more effective than primary closure in multiple clinical
trials in decreasing the risk of perioperative
carotid thrombosis, perioperative stroke and late restenosis.261-264,267,268,271-273,276,278,289 Others believe that inclusion of a patch prolongs the operative, shunt and
clamping time and makes the procedure more technically demanding and that it may also be unnecessary
in some patients.270
Results from randomized trials. Several randomized
controlled trials published over the past two decades
compared CEA with primary closure vs patch
angioplasty.261,263,264,266,267,271-273,276,278,280,283 As noted in
Table IV, most studies showed that patch closure was
superior to primary closure in all perioperative parameters including risk of perioperative stroke, stroke/death,
and restenosis.
In contrast, Al-Rawi et al266 reported results supporting
primary (direct) closure. In this study, the 30-day perioperative stroke risk was similar for microscopic patch angioplasty (3.9%) and direct arteriotomy closure (2.9%). In
