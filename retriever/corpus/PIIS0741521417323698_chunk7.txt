 CARE OF
PATIENTS WITH AN ABDOMINAL AORTIC
ANEURYSM
Physical examination. In patients with a suspected or
known abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), we recommend performing physical examination that includes
an assessment of femoral and popliteal arteries.
In patients with a popliteal or femoral artery aneurysm,
we recommend evaluation for an AAA.

Quality of evidence

A (High)

Assessment of medical comorbidities. In patients with
active cardiac conditions, including unstable angina,
decompensated heart failure, severe valvular disease,
and signiﬁcant arrhythmia, we recommend cardiology
consultation before endovascular aneurysm repair
(EVAR) or open surgical repair (OSR).
Level of recommendation

Quality of evidence

B (Moderate)

In patients with signiﬁcant clinical risk factors, such as
coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufﬁciency, and unknown or poor functional capacity
(metabolic equivalent [MET] < 4), who are to undergo
OSR or EVAR, we suggest noninvasive stress testing.

We recommend a preoperative resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in all patients undergoing EVAR or
OSR within 30 days of planned treatment.

We recommend echocardiography before planned
operative repair in patients with dyspnea of unknown
origin or worsening dyspnea.

We suggest coronary revascularization before aneurysm
repair in patients with acute ST-segment or non-STsegment elevation myocardial infarction (MI), unstable
angina, or stable angina with left main coronary artery
or three-vessel disease.
Level of recommendation

We suggest coronary revascularization before aneurysm
repair in patients with stable angina and two-vessel disease that includes the proximal left descending artery
and either ischemia on noninvasive stress testing or
