with a diseased vertebral artery have a 5-year stroke risk
of 22% to 35%.495,499-501 In addition, patients with posterior circulation strokes have higher mortality (20%-30%)
than patients with anterior circulation strokes.502-504
The proximal vertebral artery origin (V1 segment) is the
most common site of atherosclerotic stenosis (20%40% of patients), but lesions are typically smooth with
low embolic risk.505
Despite the relatively high stroke risk, only 5%-8% of operations for cerebrovascular disease are performed for

proximal vertebral disease.506 Before treatment of symptomatic vertebral artery lesions, other overlapping causes
of symptoms, such as orthostatic hypotension, aggressive
use of antihypertensive medications, inner ear pathology,
and cardiac causes must be excluded. The most common open surgical treatment is vertebral artery to CCA
transposition, with a low morbidity and mortality akin
to CEA. However, these procedures are reserved for
symptomatic patients.506-508 Outcomes of combined
stroke and death are less than 1% for vertebral artery
operation alone, but 5.7% when combined with carotid
disease intervention.507 Endovascular treatment for proximal vertebral artery disease has been reported in multiple small case series, often with a high risk of restenosis
(40%-50%)498,509-512 Distal embolic protection is often
difÔ¨Åcult because of the small size of the vertebral artery,494,513 and both angioplasty alone and in combination with stent has been described.494,509-512 The
randomized series (CAVATAS)510 and other small
descriptive series494,509,511 failed to demonstrate superior
outcome in the endovascular management of vertebral
artery disease, with a higher incidence of carotid territory
stroke, MI, and restenosis in patients having stent
placement.
