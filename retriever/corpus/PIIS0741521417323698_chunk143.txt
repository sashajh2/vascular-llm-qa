periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa, including scaling and root canal procedures.724
Both guidelines noted that there is no compelling evidence that bacteremia resulted from respiratory tract
procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures,
and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures, and
prophylaxis was not recommended for patients undergoing these procedures unless the procedures were
performed in the presence of an infection.724 It was also
strongly recommended that any potential sources of
dental sepsis be eliminated at least 2 weeks before implantation of a prosthetic valve or other intracardiac or
intravascular foreign material, unless the procedure was
deemed urgent. Others have raised concerns that
patients undergoing colonoscopy or urologic procedures, especially the elderly and those with cancer or who
are immunocompromised, require antibiotic prophylaxis.725,726 Both the European and ACC/AHA guidelines
noted that their recommendations were not based on
strong evidence, and further prospective evaluation was
recommended.
For those patients with an aortic prosthesis, whether
placed by OSR or EVAR, we suggest antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent graft infection before any dental procedure involving the manipulation of the gingival or
periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral
mucosa, including scaling and root canal procedures.

We also suggest antibiotic prophylaxis before respiratory
tract procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures, and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures if the potential for infection exists or the patient is
immunocompromised.
