3. A 42-year-old patient with a history of an arterial thrombus four years ago presents to the
ER with severe right lower extremity pain. A CTA is obtained showing no atherosclerotic
disease but with acute thrombus along the distal SFA and popliteal artery. You take the
patient to the operating room for a lower extremity angiogram. Which catheter would
be most useful to help break up the clot over time?

A. Penumbra thrombectomy catheter
B. Cragg Mcnamara Catheter
C. Fogarty Catheter
D. Peripherally inserted central venous catheter
Answer
B. Cragg Mcnamara Catheter
Discussion: In this case, the patient has an acute thrombus in her lower extremity arteries.
Although there are many treatment options for this disease process depending on disease
burden and characteristics, the question specifically asks about a catheter that can be
used to break up the clot over time. The Cragg Macnamara catheter is a thrombolysis
catheter that remains in place infusing “clot buster” medication (tPA) over a period
of hours to days to dissolve the clot. A Penumbra thrombectomy catheter is used to
suction blood clots out of a vessel. A Fogarty catheter can be used to manually withdraw
thrombus from a vessel. A PICC line is used for long-term infusions to deliver medications
to the central venous system and is not used intra-operatively for procedures.
4. A 70-year-old male is brought to the operating room for an EVAR procedure for his 6 cm
infrarenal AAA. You have chosen a graft to use and the nurse is asking if there are any
wires that you would like opened to deliver the device into the patient’s aorta. Which
of the following wires would be most useful for this task?
A. 0.018” fexible Terumo wire
B. 0.035” Amplatz wire
C. 0.035” foppy Glidewire
D. 0.014” Pilot wire
Answer
B. 0.035”
