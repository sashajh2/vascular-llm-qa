Physical examination of the graft by trained nephrologists or dialysis staff is very effective in identifying accesses
with clinically significant underlying stenosis. Abnormalities on physical examination of the access (absent thrill,
abnormal auscultation, persistent edema of the access extremity, venous collaterals on the ipsilateral chest wall) have
a high positive predictive value for stenosis estimated at 80%
in prosthetic accesses.92-94
