complex vascular reconstructions (Table I).
Noninvasive vascular laboratory diagnosis requirements. Vascular surgery training programs must
include training in noninvasive vascular laboratory studies.
To interpret these studies, a graduating trainee must
demonstrate knowledge of vascular anatomy and
physiology, as well as ultrasound physics, through the
interpretation of noninvasive vascular studies. As suggested by the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission
(previously the Intersoci
