 on this topic it was
not possible to identify studies of sufÔ¨Åcient quality
showing that such abnormalities contribute to
impaired wound healing (Supplementary material).
One prospective study did report that microvascular
changes observed in skin biopsies in the feet in people
with diabetes and neuro-ischaemia were associated
with poorer wound healing after revascularisation.83
However, both these microvascular changes and poorer
wound healing could be due to tissue damage caused
by
