 relates to the high risk of bias in many included
studies. Another limitation is the small number of
studies included per key question, limiting the ability
to detect publication bias and exploring heterogeneity.
Our systematic review targeted patients with primary
varicose veins and indeed 88% of the included studies
have explicitly excluded patients deep venous
insufﬁciency, a previous DVT or a congenital anomaly.
Nevertheless, some studies may have included such
patients.
