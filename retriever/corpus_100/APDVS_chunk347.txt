aries in the direction of the hypoxic tissue.
 Vasodilation: When blood vessels are exposed to reduced oxygen levels, they often
dilate in an attempt to increase blood fow. This vasodilation can help mobilize and
enhance the development of collateral vessels.
 Angiogenesis and Arteriogenesis: Angiogenesis involves the formation of small capillaries, while arteriogenesis involves the enlargement and maturation of existing collateral
vessels into larger arteries. These processes
