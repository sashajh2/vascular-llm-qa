 clinical practice guidelines as a resource
to assist members in the practice of vascular surgery.
The guideline recommendations contained herein are
based on a recent review of published evidence. They
reﬂect the available body of evidence, and their applicability reﬂects the limitations of that data and are subject
to reassessment and revision as new knowledge emerges.
Given these limitations, clinical practice guidelines do not
represent a statement of the standard of care, nor do they
substitute for clinician judgment
