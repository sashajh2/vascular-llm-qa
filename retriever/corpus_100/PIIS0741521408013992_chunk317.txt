 because the
vein is quite small, unless it has been arterialized from a
prior forearm access. Further, a two-stage transposition will
result in elongation of the vein during the first stage,
providing the additional vein length that is usually required
to transpose this vein to a lateral subcutaneous tunnel.
Finally, superficialization of the vein can be done if there is
inadequate length to transpose the vein, in which case the
vein should be positioned
