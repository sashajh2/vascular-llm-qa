 accelerate ﬁbrinolysis.484 Second, the presence of an ipsilateral MCA occlusion along with the ICA
occlusion, is generally caused by artery-to-artery embolism, with a platelet-rich, lytic-resistant clot proceeding
from the carotid plaque. These clots have a poorer propensity for lysis with tPA compared with ﬁbrin-rich
clots.485 Third, because of the high clot burden and
