 a risk for malnutrition exists for patients
who undergo open aneurysm repair, particularly those
with pre-existing renal insufÔ¨Åciency.608 Early feeding reduces the likelihood of malnutrition, as demonstrated in
a randomized trial of 128 patients undergoing colorectal
and abdominal vascular surgery.609
We recommend optimization of preoperative nutritional
status before elective open aneurysm repair if repair will not
be unduly delayed.
