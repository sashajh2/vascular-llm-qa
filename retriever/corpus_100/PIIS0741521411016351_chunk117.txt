 acquisition of spiral
CT images allows excellent timing with contrast administration and provides quality images that can be viewed in
multiple planes. CTA is extremely fast and offers submillimeter spatial resolution (0.3 vs 0.8 mm for contrastenhanced MRA), is less expensive than contrast-enhanced
MRA, provides a faster processing time, and can visualize
soft tissue, bone, and blood vessels at the same time. CTA
can also demonstrate vascular anomalies, has the ability
