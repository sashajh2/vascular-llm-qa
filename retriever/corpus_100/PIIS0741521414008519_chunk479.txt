ulcer healing after prolonged compression therapy.
[GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) was
initially proposed as a method to promote VLU healing
by activation of the Ô¨Åbrinolytic system and showed promise in decreasing VLU healing time in patients who had
previously failed to
