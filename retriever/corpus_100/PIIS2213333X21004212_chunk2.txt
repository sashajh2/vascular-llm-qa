ABSTRACT
Background: Several diagnostic tests and treatment options for patients with lower extremity varicose veins have existed
for decades. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the latest evidence to support the forthcoming
updates of the clinical practice guidelines on the management of varicose veins for the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS),
the American Venous Forum (AVF) and the American Vein and Lymphatic Society.
