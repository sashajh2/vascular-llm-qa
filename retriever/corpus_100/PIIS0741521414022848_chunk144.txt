exercise therapy include are enlargement of existing collateral vessels, exercise induced angiogenesis, enhanced nitric
oxide (NO) endothelium-dependent vasodilatation of the
microcirculation, improved bioenergetics of skeletal muscle,
and improved hemorrheology.
Requirements for exercise therapy. Participation in
an exercise program for IC ﬁrst requires an objective
