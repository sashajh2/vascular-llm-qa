cation. Other important considerations include presence of concomitant visceral aortic
disease and unusual venous anatomy, such as a retroaortic renal vein or left-sided vena cava. The aortic clamp
should be placed in the most caudal position possible to
avoid unnecessary renal and visceral ischemia while
allowing a safe anastomosis into healthy aortic wall. For
repair of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm, the clamp is
placed
