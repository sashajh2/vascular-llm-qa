 whether aneurysmal
degeneration results in thrombus formation or if
thrombus formation is responsible for the development
of aneurysmal dilation. As such, surgical treatment determined by the presence of thrombus alone might lead to
unjustiÔ¨Åable interventions.
Thrombus presence paired with impaired runoff, regardless of aneurysm diameter, however, might be a better
marker to identify higher risk PAAs. Microembolism from
