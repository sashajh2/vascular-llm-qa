Statistical analysis and certainty in evidence. We
calculated the odds ratio (OR) with 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) for primary and secondary outcomes, as well as
determined an incidence rate ratio for amputations
across the studies. Thus, the OR of a bad outcome (amputation) in which the intervention reduces the outcome
would be less than one and for a beneﬁcial intervention
(patency) would be greater than one. Because
