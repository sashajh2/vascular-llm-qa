er et al259 also reported that early
DUS (1 day) ﬁndings did not correlate with clinical or
hemodynamic success 1 year after SFA-popliteal angioplasty.
In a more recent study, Humphries et al260 reported that
an abnormal duplex examination within the ﬁrst 30 days of
treatment in patients undergoing infrainguinal EVT for
CLI, was associated with an increased subsequent risk of
amputation.
