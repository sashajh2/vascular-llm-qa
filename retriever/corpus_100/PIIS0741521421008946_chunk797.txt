poor collateral circulation, functional ICA occlusions
show poor response to IV thrombolysis.486
With advances in stent retrievers, recanalization rates in
patients with ICA occlusion are increasing. Optimal
endovascular strategies for patients with acute carotid
occlusion are being elucidated. Despite the complex
