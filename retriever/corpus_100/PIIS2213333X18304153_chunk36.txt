. In this position, magnetic
resonance imaging has conﬁrmed that a compression
pressure of <10 mm Hg can narrow the great saphenous
vein (GSV).
Much higher pressures are needed to narrow veins of
the lower extremity when patients are in the sitting or
standing position. Observations using duplex ultrasound
and magnetic resonance imaging conﬁrm that in the
standing position, a compression pressure of >50 mm
Hg on
