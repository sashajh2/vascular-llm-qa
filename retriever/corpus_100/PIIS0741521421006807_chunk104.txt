METHODS
Guideline framework. Our expert panel used the
GRADE approach to rate the quality of the available evidence and to grade the strength of the recommendations. This system, adopted by many other organizations,
categorizes the recommendations as strong GRADE 1 or
weak GRADE 2 according to the quality of the evidence,
the balance between desirable and undesirable effects,
the patientâ€™s values and preferences, and the required resources, feasibility and acceptability.
