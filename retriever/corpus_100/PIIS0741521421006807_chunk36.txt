2:We recommend that patients with an asymptomatic PAA >20 mm in diameter should undergo repair to reduce the
risk of thromboembolic complications and limb loss (grade 1B). For selected patients at higher clinical risk, repair can be deferred until
the PAA has become >30 mm, especially in the absence of thrombus (grade 2C)
