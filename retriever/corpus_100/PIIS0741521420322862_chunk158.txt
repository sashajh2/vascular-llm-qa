 it was worse in patients with mesenteric ischemia
than in those with Crohnâ€™s disease. The published experience using parenteral nutrition as short-term bridge to
revascularization for patients with CMI is fairly limited,
although data extrapolated for the use of total parenteral
nutrition for severely malnourished patients before
nonvascular surgical procedures suggests that it decreases major morbidity without reducing the infectious
complications.88-90 Furthermore, it cannot replace revascularization
