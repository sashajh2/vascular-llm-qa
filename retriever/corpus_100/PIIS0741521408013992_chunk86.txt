ography. Arteriography may be useful in patients
with significant peripheral vascular disease, particularly in
those individuals with suspected proximal arterial occlusive
lesions where pre-AV access interventional procedures
might both identify and treat the problem site, gaining
adequate arterial inflow for the eventual autogenous AV
access. In patients nearing dialysis, the risk of contrastinduced nephropathy must be carefully weighed against the
need for an AV access that will mature when needed by
