.07).
VALUES
In developing the recommendation that endovascular
repair should be performed preferentially over open surgical repair or nonoperative management, the committee
placed a significantly higher value on preventing catastrophic complications of thoracic aortic repair (death,
stroke, and spinal cord ischemia) and a lower value on
potential adverse events such as endoleak, need for reintervention, and device failures.
