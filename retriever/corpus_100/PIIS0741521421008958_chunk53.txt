 high risk of bias
owing to a lack of blinding of outcome assessors, and
inadequate random sequence generation, allocation
concealment and possible selective reporting. The
studies reported on 5486 patients (mean age, 69 years;
75% males). The most common comorbidities in this
group of patients are hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and
coronary artery disease.
