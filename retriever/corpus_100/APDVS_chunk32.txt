degree of ischemia (claudication vs. chronic limb-threatening ischemia).
 Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a sudden occlusion of the blood supply with no time for
collateral vessels to develop. It is characterized by the 6 Ps. Pulselessness, pain, pallor,
paresthesia, poikilothermia (cold), and paralysis. The most common etiology of acute
limb ischemia is embolic.
