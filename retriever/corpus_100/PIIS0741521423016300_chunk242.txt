) is associated with a higher probability of DFU healing and lower likelihood of limb
loss.74 As shorter time to revascularisation was associated with higher probability of DFU healing and lower
likelihood of limb loss, a Best Practice Statement supporting urgent referral for vascular consultation in people with DFU and evidence of severe ischaemia was
made (Fig. 1).

Rationale
In the presence of PAD and infection or gangrene, an
urgent revascularisation should be considered.
