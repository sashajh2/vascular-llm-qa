 because testing could result in unnecessary
saphenous vein ablation procedures.

Rationale. Asymptomatic CEAP Class C1 venous disorder
is usually a cosmetic problem; asymptomatic telangiectasias or reticular veins should not be treated for the purpose
of preventing progression to more advanced venous disease.
Saphenous vein ablation is not indicated in these patients for
medical reasons. The GSV may need to be used in the future
