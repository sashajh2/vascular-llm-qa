Treatment failure including persistent perfusion, recanalization, and coil migration has been observed. The potential for early or late failure, such as growth in sac size
or leak that would require reintervention, requires early
and serial imaging follow-up.93,97 Because artifact due
to the radiopaque materials used may make sensitive
CT evaluation difÔ¨Åcult, some authors recommend
contrast-enhanced ultrasound or MRI as follow-up imaging techniques.6,97
