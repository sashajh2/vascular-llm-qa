.54,55 An extensive collateral
network, as often seen in the presence of an SMA or CA
occlusion, can lead to increased ﬂow velocities in the
other, unaffected mesenteric vessels, suggesting a significant stenosis when one is not actually present.54 Similarly, signiﬁcantly high peak systolic and diastolic
velocities were found during expiration (vs inspiration),
thus, potentially impacting the accurate assessment of
the degree of
