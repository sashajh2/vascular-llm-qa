5.2.6. In patients with an epifascial or superﬁcial
saphenous vein, thermal ablation may result in skin
burns, hyperpigmentation, or induration, while
nonthermal techniques may cause hyperpigmentation
or induration. Miniphlebectomy or limited stripping is
safe and effective, if the saphenous vein is close to
the skin (<0.5 cm).
