 all suitable patients with IC.
We recommend home-based exercise, with a goal of at least 30 minutes of walking
three to ﬁve times per week when a supervised exercise program is unavailable or for
long-term beneﬁt after a supervised exercise program is completed.
In patients who have undergone revascularization therapy for IC, we recommend
exercise (either supervised or home based) for adjunctive functional beneﬁts.
We recommend that patients with IC be followed up annually to assess compliance
