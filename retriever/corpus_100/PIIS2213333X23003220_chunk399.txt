lation of reﬂuxing distal calf saphenous veins to
avoid thermal nerve injury.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. Studies have shown that thermal ablation of
the below-knee GSV is feasible and safe.151 In addition,
nonthermal techniques are available if there are concerns about saphenous nerve injury. Elimination of
below-knee GSV reﬂux has been shown to improve
symptoms and reduce the need for additional procedures, compared
