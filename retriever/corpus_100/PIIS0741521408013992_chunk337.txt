 prosthetic access is performed between the axillary vein and the
ipsilateral axillary artery using a prosthetic graft as conduit.

the pectoralis major muscle. The prosthetic graft is tunneled superficially in a loop on the chest wall between the
axillary vein and artery to perform the two anastomoses.
