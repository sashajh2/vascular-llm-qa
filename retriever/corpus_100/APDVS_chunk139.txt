 plaque formation are related to age, smoking, coronary artery disease,
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and family history of stroke. Due to carotid bulb
anatomy, the most common area of plaque formation is within the proximal internal carotid
artery. As plaque stenosis increases over time, the systolic velocity increases to maintain
fow volumes which intensifies shear stress. This shear stress increases likelihood of plaque
rupture, platelet aggregation and throm
