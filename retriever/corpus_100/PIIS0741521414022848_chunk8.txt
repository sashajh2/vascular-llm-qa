 anatomic durability is expected to meet this minimum threshold. Conversely, caution is warranted in
the use of interventions for IC in anatomic settings where durability is limited (extensive calciÔ¨Åcation, small-caliber arteries,
diffuse infrainguinal disease, poor runoff). Surgical bypass may be a preferred strategy in good-risk patients with these disease
patterns or in those with prior endovascular failures. Common femoral artery disease should be treated surgically, and saphenous
