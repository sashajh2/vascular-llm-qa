 of the carbon dioxide foam
group and in 4% of the air foam group (P ⫽ .53). Overall,
the proportion of patients describing adverse effects decreased from 39% (19 to 49) to 11% (14 to 128) as carbon
dioxide replaced air for foam preparation (P ⬍ .001). The
authors concluded that adverse effects decreased significantly if carbon dioxide rather than air was used
