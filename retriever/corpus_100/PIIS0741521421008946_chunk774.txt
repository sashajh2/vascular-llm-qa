 suggests that criteria used
for diagnosing an atherosclerotic stenosis of the carotid
artery cannot be easily applied to in-stent restenosis.464
This is due to the distinct biomechanical properties of
the stented artery and its enhanced stiffness which results in increased ﬂow velocity. Recent analysis proposed
adjusted criteria for deﬁning stenosis in stented arteries.464,466,467
