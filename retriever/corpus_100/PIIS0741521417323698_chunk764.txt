NEED OF FURTHER RESEARCH
Advances in biotechnology, drug discovery, and the engineering sciences hold signiÔ¨Åcant promise for the development of new diagnostic tests, bioactive compounds,
and intraoperative tools and devices that will enhance
the care of the patient with an aortic aneurysm. Research
is needed (1) to ascertain genetic or other biologic factors
that accurately measure the lifelong risk for development of an aortic aneur
