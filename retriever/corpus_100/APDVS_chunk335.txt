 is closely associated with PAD due to hyperglycemiainduced endothelial dysfunction and microvascular damage. It accelerates atherosclerosis by promoting lipid abnormalities, systemic infammation, and the development of
neuropathy, which can mask or delay the recognition of PAD symptoms.
 Hypertension: Hypertension is a major contributor to PAD. Elevated blood pressure
damages arterial walls, rendering them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. Hypertension
also increases the risk of throm
