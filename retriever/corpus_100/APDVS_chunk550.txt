forces to clear a thrombus. The procedural steps are similar to catheter-directed thrombolysis
in terms of percutaneous access and cannulation of the target vessel. This procedure utilizes
an aspiration mechanical thrombectomy catheter to simultaneously provide fragmentation and
aspiration to restore arterial fow.
Pharmacomechanical thrombectomy is a very similar concept as mechanical thrombectomy. In addition to mechanical clot extraction, it applies thrombolytic therapy with a
