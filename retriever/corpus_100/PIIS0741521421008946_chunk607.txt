cannot be used in tortuous arteries. In contrast, open cell
designs are more ﬂexible and can accommodate
tortuous carotid anatomy but have large cell sizes that
might increase risk of plaque protrusion and potential
embolization. Current evidence on speciﬁc stent design
remains controversial, but largely supports beneﬁts of
close cell design. One small randomized clinical trial of
40 patients showed no difference in embolization between
