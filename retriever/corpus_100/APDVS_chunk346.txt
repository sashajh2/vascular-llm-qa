 in angiogenesis (the formation
of new blood vessels) and arteriogenesis (the remodeling and enlargement of existing
collateral vessels) through the stimulation of endothelial cells. Endothelial cells line
blood vessels and play a central role in angiogenesis. They respond to these growth
factors enabling endothelial cell proliferation and migration, which are essential for the
formation of new capillaries in the direction of the hypoxic tissue.
