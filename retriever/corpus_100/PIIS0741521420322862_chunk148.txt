 revascularization and

revascularization of the SMA alone is usually sufÔ¨Åcient
given the extensive mesenteric collateral network. Revascularization of the CA or IMA alone should likely be
reserved for scenarios when revascularization of the
SMA is inadequate or not feasible. It is possible for patients to develop symptoms consistent with CMI with
occlusive disease isolated to the SMA despite the traditional teaching that it requires involvement of at least
two mesenteric vessels. Revascular
