Guideline 3.11: Venous Imaging
We suggest selective computed tomography venography, magnetic resonance venography, contrast
venography, and/or intravascular ultrasound in patients with suspected venous leg ulceration if additional
advanced venous diagnosis is required for thrombotic
or nonthrombotic iliac vein obstruction or for operative planning before open or endovenous interventions.
