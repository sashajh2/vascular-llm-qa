 The risks associated with bilateral HA occlusion are restricted to more severe, persistent, and
frequent
buttock
claudication
and
erectile
dysfunction.341
Technical considerations that may reduce the incidence of adverse events when bilateral HA embolization
is required include a staged approach, embolization of
only the proximal main trunk of the HA, and preservation
of collateral branches from the common and deep
femoral arteries.3
