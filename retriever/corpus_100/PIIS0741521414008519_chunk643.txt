-year follow-up.501 Unlike treatment
for VLU recurrence prevention, when compression is
used for prophylaxis against VLU in those at risk, there is
no evidence that high levels of compression are more effective than lesser. A meta-analysis of 11 RCTs of compression
for CVI suggested that the level of compression needed to
be at least 10 to 15 mm Hg, but higher levels were not
necessarily beneÔ¨Åcial.
