approach typically requires a multidisciplinary collaborative procedural team of vascular, general, transplantation, and urology surgeons. The dexterity of the robotic
arms reportedly confers a technical advantage to complex aneurysmectomy and intracorporeal vascular suturing for reconstruction. Technical success has been
reported in case series with warm ischemia times between 15 and 60 minutes; however, a direct comparison
to open and endovascular techniques
