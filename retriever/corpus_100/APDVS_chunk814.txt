often secondary to hypertension) or iatrogenically (in the setting
of arterial puncture). This most often occurs in the setting of a posteriorly lying plaque
in the artery where the wire can separate the posterior layers.
 To prevent dissection, do not apply too much forward pressure when advancing a wire
during initial arterial access. Do not inject fuid (saline or contrast) unless there is blood
return to ensure the needle or catheter tip are in the true lumen.
