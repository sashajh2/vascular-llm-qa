 artery and intracranial portions. Although the intracranial cerebral arteries can be assessed with transcranial
Doppler imaging, this technique is not as widely available at
most institutions as other imaging modalities.
In addition to determining percent stenosis, DUS, as
noted above, has been used to determine plaque characteristics (echogenicity) using gray scale median values, which
predict the stroke risk of a particular plaque. Plaque characterization is not routine in
