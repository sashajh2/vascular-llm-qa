 planning. Consideration of the
patient’s dominant arm or incapacitation of one extremity
from a previous stroke may influence, but not dictate, an
AV access decision. Placement of an autogenous AV access
is particularly important in patients with chronic infections,
recurrent skin diseases, and immunosuppression. Finally,
the patient’s overall medical condition, social support
structure, and life expectancy should be considered when
considering long-term vascular access.
