 7 days for
their level of pain using a VAS pain score (0, no pain;
10, maximum pain). The results demonstrate a highly
signiÔ¨Åcant reduction in pain at 7 days in patients treated
with additional bulk (pain score of 1.4 with bulk plus
stocking vs 4.9 with stocking alone). The authors
concluded that additional focused eccentric compression directly over the treated vein greatly reduces postablation pain at 7 days.
