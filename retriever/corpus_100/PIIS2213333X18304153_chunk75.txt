 lack of blinding, lack of
randomization, lack of data addressing compression
strengths, and inconsistent outcomes. However, taken
together, they suggest that postoperative pain in the Ô¨Årst
7 days after saphenous surgery or thermal ablation can
be reduced with the use of higher compression modalities and eccentric compression.

2. SHORT-TERM COMPRESSION (<2 WEEKS) VS
LONGER TERM COMPRESSION AFTER THERMAL
ABLATION
