ia detection by transesophageal echocardiography in the form of wall motion abnormalities precedes
ST-segment changes and is a more sensitive monitor

vascular surgery has been advocated,594 routine
measurement has not been associated with improved
clinical outcomes.586

We suggest using pulmonary artery catheters only if the
likelihood of a major hemodynamic disturbance is high.
