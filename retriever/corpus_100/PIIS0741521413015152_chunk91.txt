 PAD
in the Eurodiale study tripled the likelihood of wound nonhealing.54 Infection can augment the need for perfusion
both by increased metabolic activity and small vessel
thrombosis attributable to angiotoxic enzymes. Worsening
severity of ischemia likely further increases amputation risk
in the presence of infection, although the severity of
ischemia was not speciÔ¨Åed in Eurodiale. Despite the clear
importance of infection in the pathway
