 This 12-member group was
instructed to use the classiﬁcation system to address two
questions. First, what is the perceived risk of amputation

perceived beneﬁt from revascularization for each possible
combination? This exercise was designed to deﬁne stages
of disease that might subsequently be useful for clinical
decision-making and prospective studies.
