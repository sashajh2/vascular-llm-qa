 care due to improved safety and eï¬€cacy (Rautio et al. 2002a). The
most widespread technologies used for the treatment of truncal vein refux are radiofrequency
ablation (RFA) and endovenous laser ablation (EVLA). Both techniques utilize heat to induce
closure of the dysfunctional veins. RFA works by delivering radiofrequency energy, heating the
vein wall to cause destruction of the endothelium, contraction of vein
