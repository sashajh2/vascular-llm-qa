 commonly
presents as caudal migration of the proximal endograft.
A delayed type IA endoleak will occur if the endograft
migrates into the aneurysm sac. Rarely, aortic remodeling will create forces that cause cranial migration of
the distal landing zone and a resultant type IB endoleak.
Device migration is a late event, typically occurring 2
years or more after implantation.674-676 Factors
