uminal angioplasty.

5C. Infrainguinal disease
Occlusive lesions of the FP segment most commonly
present with IC involving the calf. Isolated lesions of the
crural or foot arteries usually do not cause claudication,
although disease involving both segments may cause severe
calf claudication and symptoms can involve the foot. In
many patients, unilateral calf claudication is well tolerated
and may be managed conservatively, as previously
described.
