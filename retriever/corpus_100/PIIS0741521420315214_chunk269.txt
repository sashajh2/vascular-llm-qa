 series of 101 LSA revascularizations
had a relatively high rate of permanent nerve injuries
(9%) along with a 6% lymph leak rate, requiring dietary
modiﬁcation alone.149 Despite these complications, the
series reported only a 2% ischemic stroke rate and 0%
SCI after TEVAR.
Despite a net beneﬁt of reduction in SCI and stroke,150
these complications certainly compromise the effectiveness of TEVAR.
