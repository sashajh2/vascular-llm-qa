5.2.7. For patients with large (>10 mm), nonaneurysmal saphenous veins, thermal ablation with EVLA
or RFA should be performed over nonthermal
techniques.
Consensus statement.
Rationale. While there are many techniques to perform
venous ablation and they provide favorable outcomes in
the setting of large diameter (>10 mm) veins, thermal ablations have superiority over other treatments.
