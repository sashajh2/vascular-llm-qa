CA must be
free of severe calciÔ¨Åcation and atheroma. A minimal 6mm luminal diameter is required. Proper distance between the clavicle and bifurcation (5-cm landing zone) is
required for TCAR. The depth of the CCA should be also
evaluated. The ratio of depth/landing zone should be less
than 1:2. In anatomies where the ratio is greater than one,
TCAR is not recommended. Details
