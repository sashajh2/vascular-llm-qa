, have slightly more penetration than alpha particles.
They have some ability to penetrate the skin. However, they can be easily blocked by less
dense shielding like aluminum.
Similar to alpha particles, beta particles can also cause harm if ingested or inhaled.

Gamma Rays
Gamma rays possess significantly more energy and can penetrate through the human body
and less dense shielding.
Lead is effective in shielding against gamma rays due to its density. Dense materials
increase the likelihood of radiation interacting with subatomic particles,
