 AAA shape rather
than diameter alone.210-216 With ultrasound-based
assessment, determination of peak wall stress may
soon be translatable to real-time assessment of the patient.217 Modeling by computational ﬂuid dynamics has
suggested that intraluminal hemodynamic conditions
also inﬂuence AAA growth, remodeling, and risk of
rupture.218-222
The peak wall rupture index considers both peak wall
