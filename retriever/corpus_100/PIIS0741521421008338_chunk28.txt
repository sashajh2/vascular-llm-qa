to superÔ¨Åcial femoral artery, and concomitant aneurysms).
We used the GRADE approach to evaluate certainty in the
evidence (also called quality of evidence).8 In this approach,
randomized trials start at high level of certainty and observational studies start at low level of certainty. Certainty can
be graded down owing to study limitations, imprecision,
indirectness, inconsistency, or publication bias. Certainty
can also be increased, for example, for a
