5 The major
limitations of duplex ultrasound include its dependence on
a skilled operator and its inability to completely image the
proximal and intracranial vasculature. Certain anatomic
features can also reduce the accuracy of duplex ultrasound
imaging, including severe vascular calciÔ¨Åcation and arterial
tortuosity.15
At present, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) can provide three-dimensional images that can rival those of formal arteriography.
