Preemptive angioplasty associated with monitoring
and surveillance. As mentioned previously, a number of
observational studies (using historical controls) have shown
a substantial reduction in the rate of graft thrombosis after
implementing a program of stenosis monitoring or surveillance with preemptive angioplasty. More recently, six randomized clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of this
approach in reducing graft thrombosis or prolonging graft
longevity. These studies have used a variety
