 mass and eGFR have been
documented after OSR and EVAR, even in the setting of
age-adjusted normal renal function before surgery.118 For
example, acute kidney injury and chronic kidney injury
have been noted after complex EVAR with snorkel or
renal stent placement, with an increased risk among
women.119 Even transient postoperative renal dysfunction is associated with an increase in mortality, morbidity,
and the need for additional ICU support.
