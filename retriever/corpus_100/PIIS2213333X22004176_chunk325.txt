 rates for
the MOCA procedure at 3 years and for UGFS with
physician-compounded foam at 5 years have made
them less durable treatment compared with thermal
ablation. It should be noted, however, that CAC was noninferior to thermal ablation at 5 years in one study.12 Prospective comparative studies with endovenous
microfoam are needed to conﬁrm the long-term clinical
efﬁcacy and a decreased incidence
