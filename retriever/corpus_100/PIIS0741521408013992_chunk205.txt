 incidence of lowflow etiologies proximal to the venous needle in autogenous accesses where VDP is measured.
Measurement of dynamic VDP (at a low dialysis blood
flow of 200 ml/min) is a relative poor marker of autogenous or prosthetic access stenosis. It is affected by multiple
factors, including the dialysis blood flow, needle diameter,
type of dialysis machine, and the patientâ€™s blood pressure.
Better standardization can be achieved
