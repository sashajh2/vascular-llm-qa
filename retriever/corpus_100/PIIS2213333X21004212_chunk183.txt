 Question 3. Analyses were stratiﬁed
based on publication year (before and after 2016). For
most analyses, there was no statistically signiﬁcant differences between the two subgroup estimates. We also
conducted sensitivity analyses in which we excluded
studies with a high risk of bias, and the results were
consistent with the main analysis for most of the outcomes. All outcomes including estimates from subgroup
and sensitivity analyses are presented in Supplementary
