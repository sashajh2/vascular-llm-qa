 We suggest that the choice of revascularization for
recurrent stenoses should be similar to the de novo lesions with the endovascular approach recommended
as the initial option and open revascularization

reserved for lesions not amenable to the endovascular
approach. Level of recommendation: Grade 2 (Weak),
Quality of Evidence: C (Low)
Rationale and background
Patients may develop recurrent stenoses and/or recurrent symptoms after both endovascular and open revascular
