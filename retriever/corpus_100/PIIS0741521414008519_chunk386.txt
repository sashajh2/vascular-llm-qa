 reduction in bacterial counts.
Davies et al suggested that bacterial density was predictive
of nonhealing of VLUs.122 However, Lantis and Gendics
found that when they treated VLUs with high bacterial
counts with topical antibiotics, bacterial counts decreased
but there was no correlation with improvement in wound
size.241 Finally, Moore et al reported that the speciÔ¨Åc bacterial species present or the number of species of bacteria
present did not relate to
