 a central mechanism, as in iliocaval obstruction or
elevated inferior vena cava pressure from advanced truncal
obesity. The mere existence of either reﬂux or obstruction
does not appear to be the full cause of venous ulcers, with
additional biochemical factors due to activation of the inﬂammatory cascade, which may act as the inciting factor
for appearance of the actual ulcer. Identiﬁcation of these
additional factors awaits further advances in the
