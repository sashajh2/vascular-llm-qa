Recommendations for aneurysm surveillance. Surveillance imaging should use ultrasound examinations
unless other imaging modalities are speciﬁcally indicated. The optimal frequency for surveillance after recognition of early-stage AAA disease has not been deﬁned
by randomized clinical study. Some authors have suggested that there is no need to observe patients with an
initial aortic diameter <3 cm, given their low risk for
rupture.
