 was the key
determinant of successful revascularization.
Isolated revascularization of the CA or IMA may be justiﬁed in select patients when the SMA is not suitable for
revascularization. The characteristics of the SMA that
affect treatment selection include vessel diameter,
extent of stenosis or occlusion, presence of tandem lesions, degree of calciﬁcation, and the extent of collateralization. Admittedly, most of these concerns are more
relevant
