10 Using a probabilistic
cost-effectiveness model iteration, their results favored
laser ablation over foam ablation. When the main
outcome measure was the occlusion rate of the treated
GSV, the 5-year results were similar after high ligation
and saphenous stripping and EVLA (96% vs 89%) but
signiÔ¨Åcantly worse after UGFS (51%; P < .001).10 A
