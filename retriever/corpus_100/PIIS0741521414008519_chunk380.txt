 bioﬁlms and the multiple species that are typically
cultured from these wounds add another layer of
complexity. Finally, the changing nature of bacterial
behavior over time may render studies performed as
recently as 5 to 10 years ago irrelevant.
Developing technology, which has allowed more
detailed descriptions of the bacteria found existing in the
