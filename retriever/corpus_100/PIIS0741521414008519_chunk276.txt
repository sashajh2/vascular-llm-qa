 cellulitis, purulence, increased exudate, malodor, discolored friable granulation tissue, bioﬁlm, tissue necrosis,
or ulcer progression, microbiologic cultures are recommended. Microbiology cultures can be obtained from
wound surface or wound drainage by validated quantitative bacteriology swab methods with reproducible reliability compared with deep wound tissue biopsy and
culture. Molecular techniques using polymerase chain reaction analysis may improve pathogen identiﬁcation over
standard swab culture methods
