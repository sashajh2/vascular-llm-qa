. These systems ﬁrst advance the guidewire
and then track the EPD over that wire. An angiogram is
usually obtained before completion and removal of the
EPD. If extensive amounts of debris are trapped within
the EPD, blood ﬂow in the ICA might stop. In this case,
the resultant standing column of blood and any embolic
debris should be aspirated to prevent embolization
when the EPD is withdrawn.366
