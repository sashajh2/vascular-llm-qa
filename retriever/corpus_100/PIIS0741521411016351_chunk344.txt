 CTA, or MRA
should identify a tight lesion in the carotid bifurcation.
The presumption is that optimizing hemispheric blood
flow will improve perfusion to the ischemic hemisphere and
reduce the ultimate extent of neurologic deficit. This must
be balanced by concern that restoring blood flow may
result in hemorrhagic conversion of an infarction or a
reperfusion injury.
There are no large series of patients treated in a standard manner from which to draw definitive
