 occurs with
either modality. This possibility must be carefully considered during discussions with patients, particularly those
with bilateral disease and more challenging anatomy. In
average-risk claudicant patients with advanced FP occlusive disease (FPOD), surgical bypass provides better durability, a decreased need for reintervention, and is usually
well tolerated, with a low rate of complications. In bypasses crossing the knee joint, good-quality saphenous
vein is the preferred conduit when available.
