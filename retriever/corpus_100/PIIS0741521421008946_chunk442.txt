Multiple studies have documented the numerous advantages of this technique. These include no risk of prosthetic infection, less operative time and cerebral
ischemic clamp time than patched CEA, preservation
of the anatomic and hemodynamic geometry of the
ICA/CCA, and possibly a decreased risk of restenosis.319
Although early studies reported decreased restenosis
risk, in meta-analyses it has been shown
