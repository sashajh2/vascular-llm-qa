 in whom an intervention is planned.
We suggest treatment of pelvic congestion syndrome and pelvic
varices with coil embolization, plugs, or transcatheter
sclerotherapy, used alone or together.
If less invasive treatment is not available or has failed, we suggest
surgical ligation and excision of ovarian veins to treat reflux.
