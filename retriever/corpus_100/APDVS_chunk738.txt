Length
 Wires are measured in centimeters (cm) and typically range from 80 - 300 cm.
 Wires must not only be long enough to reach the target vessel from the point of access,
but also need to be long enough to support exchanges outside of the body as needed.
 Care must be taken to avoid too long of a wire for its intended purpose as it is harder
to control the end of the wire outside of the body.
