 of the hemodynamic parameters obtained from Doppler ultrasound analysis, including the
peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities. The ultrasound
criteria for the degree of carotid stenosis should be deÔ¨Åned
by the angiographic and imaging correlation in each
vascular laboratory. The most commonly recognized
consensus criteria include a cutoff peak systolic velocity of
the internal carotid artery of $125 cm/s to denote angiographic stenosis of $50%.
