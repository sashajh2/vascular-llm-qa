, despite the reduced risk
compared with OSR, EVAR remains an intermediate- to
high-risk procedure for cardiovascular complication.

Given the risk associated with either OSR or EVAR, it is
essential to evaluate the overall operative risk associated
with either method of repair. The Ô¨Årst step should be to
determine whether an active cardiovascular condition
exists (Table III), which would mandate further assessment and management before planned aneurysm
repair. In the absence of an
