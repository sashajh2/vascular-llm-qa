and whether a test dose of contrast material vs bolustracking software is used. In general, fast injection rates
and high concentrations of iodine are the general principles that allow high-quality imaging. A reasonable estimate
is that a total of 60 to 140 mL of nonionic iodinated contrast
agent can be injected at a rate of 4 to 6 mL/s. This high injection rate necessitates a power injector, preferably with
