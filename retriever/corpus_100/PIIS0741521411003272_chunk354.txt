 to high ligation,
division, and cryostripping vs conventional stripping. No
differences in QOL measures were noted by the SF-36
questionnaire at 6 months between the two groups. Bruising was more frequent after conventional stripping (P â«½
.01), but there was no difference in pain score or complications. Two patients from the conventional stripping
group and six from the cryostripping group were excluded
from analysis because of incomplete stripping.
