available, in combination with compression, to accelerate healing of venous ulcers.

of compression treatment is to compensate for the increased ambulatory venous hypertension. Pressures to
compress the superficial veins in supine patients range from
20 to 25 mm Hg. When upright, pressures of 35 to 40 mm
Hg have been shown to narrow the superficial veins, and
pressures â¬Ž60 mm Hg are needed to occlude them.
