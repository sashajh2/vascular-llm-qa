 of other postCEA complications, including myocardial ischemia, ICH,
and wound hematoma.432 Appropriate management of
both postoperative hypertension and hypotension can

To appropriately treat hemodynamic instability after
CEA, patient observation in a monitored unit with either
an indwelling radial artery catheter of systemic blood
pressure monitoring is generally recommended in the
initial postoperative period.417
