Velocity-based estimation of carotid artery stenosis may
need to be adjusted in certain circumstances, for example,
higher velocities in women than in men and higher velocities in the presence of contralateral carotid artery occlusion.70,71 High carotid bifurcation, severe arterial tortuosity, extensive vascular calcification, and obesity may also
reduce the accuracy of DUS imaging. Carotid stents will
decrease compliance of the vessel wall
