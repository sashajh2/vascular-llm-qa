techniques in many ways, so a discussion of concepts and
data applying to both of these procedures is appropriate.
Occlusion (ablation) of the treated vein is achieved by
heat delivered into the vein through the percutaneously
placed laser fiber or an RF catheter. Endovenous thermal
ablation causes a direct thermal injury to the vein wall,
resulting in destruction of the endothelium, collagen denaturation of the media, and fibrotic and thrombot
