 abdominal aortic aneurysms typically involve
visceral branches of the aorta as well (i.e. the SMA or celiac trunk) and thus may also
be classified as a Crawford type IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA)
 Aneurysms are labeled “pararenal” when the proximal extent of the aneurysm is at the
level of the renal arteries and includes the origins of the renal arteries.
