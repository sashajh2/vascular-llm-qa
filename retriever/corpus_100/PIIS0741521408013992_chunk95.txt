future accesses (GRADE 1 recommendation, very
low-quality evidence).
B. When possible, autogenous AV accesses should be
considered before prosthetic arteriovenous accesses
are placed. These autogenous access configurations
should include, in order of preference, the use of
direct AV anastomosis, venous transpositions, and
