in IC be a >50% likelihood of sustained clinical improvement for at least 2 years. Freedom from hemodynamically
signiÔ¨Åcant restenosis in the treated limb is considered a prerequisite for this goal.
Because anatomic durability is generally inferior for
infrainguinal vs aortoiliac procedures and for bilateral vs unilateral infrainguinal interventions, most experienced clinicians have a higher treatment threshold for IC in these
settings. In bilateral disease, treating
