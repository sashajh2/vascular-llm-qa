reintervention, anatomic patency after intervention with selective stenting for long-segment SFA lesions (mean length,
16.5 cm) at 1 year was poor, although clinical outcomes were
favorable. After tibial interventions, Schmidt et al262 reported an angiographic >50% restenosis rate of 31.2% and
a treated segment occlusion rate of 37.6% at 3 months after
treatment
