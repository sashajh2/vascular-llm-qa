 than did those for which débridement was not
performed. However, débridement frequency per patient
did not statistically correlate to rates of wound closure.
Recommendations to débride nonviable or necrotic tissue from the wound bed are supported by established principles of management of all wounds.223,224 However, the
frequency and method of débridement are not well studied
and have not been well established as related to the incidence of wound closure.
