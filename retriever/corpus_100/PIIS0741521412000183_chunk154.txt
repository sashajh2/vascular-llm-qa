 to
demonstrate the proximal extent of thrombus with an extended surgical approach if the IVC is involved; intraoperative
use of positive end-expiratory pressure to reduce the risk of PE;
intraoperative completion venography to ensure patency of the
iliac vein; stenting of any identified iliac vein lesions; use of a
temporary arteriovenous fistula to reduce early rethrombosis; and
carefully monitored postoperative anticoagulation
