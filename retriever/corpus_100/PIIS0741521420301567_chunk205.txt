Serial imaging was available for 94% of the aneurysms,
and these patients received an average of 2.5 CT scans
during 4.6 years of follow-up. The average growth rate
was a nominal 0.2 mm/y during 3.1 years of follow-up.
There were again no ruptures or other complications
attributed to the aneurysms in the observed group.
