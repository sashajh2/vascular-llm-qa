 RF catheter system, sequential heating of
the vein is performed at 7-cm intervals, heating the vein to
120Â°C in each 20-second cycle. The first segment is treated
twice. At the end of the procedure, the saphenous vein is
reimaged to confirm successful obliteration and absence of
thrombus protrusion into the femoral vein or, if the SSV
was treated, into the popliteal vein.
