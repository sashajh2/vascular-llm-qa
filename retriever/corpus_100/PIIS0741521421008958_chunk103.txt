CONCLUSIONS
This systematic review supports the SVS clinical practice guidelines for commonly raised clinical scenarios in

was superior to medical therapy in the long-term prevention of stroke/death over medical therapy. CEA was also
superior to transfemoral CAS in minimizing long-term
stroke/death for symptomatic low risk surgical patients.
CEA should optimally be performed between 2
