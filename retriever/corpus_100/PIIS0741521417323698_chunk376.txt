A patient with a known AAA or pulsatile mass on
abdominal examination who presents without hemodynamic instability and acute onset of back or abdominal
pain should undergo an immediate CT scan to determine whether rupture has occurred. Whereas a ruptured
AAA represents a surgical emergency, the timing of
aneurysm repair for patients with a symptomatic but
nonruptured aneurysm represents a clinical dilemma.
Under select circumstances, it may be appropriate to
delay intervention for several hours
