, re-entrant tear, or double channel with false lumen.

It is speculated that the vasa vasorum is responsible for
IMH, with elevated pressures in the vasa vasorum leading
to rupture within the aortic wall. Subsequently, progression and eventual rupture into the intima might occur,
leading to typical AD. Studies examining the vasa vasorum have also suggested that hyperplasia leading to
chronic, occlusive disease within the aortic wall can
lead to
