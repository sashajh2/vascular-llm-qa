 proteolysis with an increased risk of rupture. However, animal
studies have not found evidence of increased aortic
collagenase activity,301 nor has this notion been supported by a prospective clinical study.302 It seems
unlikely that the risk of aneurysm rupture is substantially
increased by an unrelated operation and that a severalweek delay to enable satisfactory recovery is acceptable
before elective AAA repair.
In summary, the optimal timing of AAA repair is based
