 follow-up, in contrast
to the 90% to 95% rate observed after vein graft placement; a
de novo stenosis rate after EVT is w28%, compared with 5%
after vein grafting.249 The authors also observed stabilization
or resolution of stenosis after EVT occurred quite commonly
despite early abnormal Ô¨Åndings. One important difference
observed compared with FP vein grafts is the poor correlation
between the degree of
