 of a pulse. The type
of waveform provides important information about the characteristics of blood fow. These
waveforms can be categorized as triphasic, bisphasic, or monophasic. Clinicians use these
waveform patterns to diagnose and monitor arterial diseases, assess the severity of stenosis,
and determine the effectiveness of treatment interventions.
Pulse volume recordings (PVR) use pressure cuffs to record the shape of a pulse. The type
of waveform provides important information
