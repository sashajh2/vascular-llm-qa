 severe vascular calciÔ¨Åcation and arterial tortuosity can
also decrease the accuracy of duplex imaging.3
MR angiography. Current contrast-enhanced MR angiography (MRA) can provide three-dimensional images,
which can rival those of formal arteriography.40 The main
advantages of MRA include the absence of radiation and
the avoidance of iodinated-based contrast materials.
Additionally, MRA can be combined with MR brain imaging to delineate clinically silent cerebral infarction
