 In open
PAA repair (OPAR), if the medial approach is used, the
aneurysm should be bypassed with proximal and distal
ligation of the aneurysm sac. Sac obliteration is desirable
but can be technically difÔ¨Åcult to complete. If the posterior approach is used, bypass and aneurysmorrhaphy
should be performed. In patients with very large PAAs
and compressive symptoms, the posterior approach is advantageous because
