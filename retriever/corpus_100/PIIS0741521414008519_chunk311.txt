duplex ultrasound of the femoral vein may provide indirect
evidence of outï¬‚ow obstruction with monophasic waveforms, loss of respiratory variation in the femoral tracing,
or poor augmentation of the signal with distal limb

duplex ultrasound may be improved by performing direct
duplex ultrasound examination of iliocaval veins, reliable
