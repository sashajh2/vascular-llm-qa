Therapeutic ultrasound has been found to stimulate a
number of cellular effects associated with the acceleration
of wound healing. These cellular effects have been well
studied in vitro and include improvement of microcirculation, reduction of edema, and increases in cytokine and
other protein levels that are active in the healing
cascade.269 Clinical trials studying the effects of ultrasound
have reported positive results in the healing of a variety of
chronic nonhealing wounds.
