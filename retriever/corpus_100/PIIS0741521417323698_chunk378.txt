 AAA, >5.4 cm in diameter. In the
ADAM trial, rupture risk was estimated at 10% per year
for aneurysms between 5.5 and 6.9 cm in diameter but
>33% per year when aneurysms were 7 cm or larger in
diameter.66 Recent reports, however, suggest that
contemporary rupture rates may be lower than previously
estimated. For example, a pooled analysis from
