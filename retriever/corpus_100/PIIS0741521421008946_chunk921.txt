 analysis of post-CEA ultrasound examination surveillance estimated total hospital charges
of $1,408,320 with a reimbursement of $702,400 for 489

annually thereafter. This surveillance protocol detected
only four patients with a greater than 80% restenosis,
raising concerns about overuse of surveillance ultrasound
