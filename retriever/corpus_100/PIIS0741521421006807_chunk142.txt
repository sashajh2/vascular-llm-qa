stenoses or synechiae.
In the absence of an adequate single-segment GSV, an
alternative conduit such as an expanded polytetraﬂuoroethylene graft can be used with acceptable outcomes.58
An alternative autogenous vein may not provide better
long-term patency outcomes than an expanded polytetraﬂuoroethylene conduit.59 The latter, using a posterior
approach, often allows for a good
