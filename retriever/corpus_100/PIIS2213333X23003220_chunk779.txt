 inpatient and outpatient
procedures suggests that identiﬁcation of patient and
procedural related risk factors allows for identiﬁcation
of 15- to 20-fold variation in VTE risk. Individualized risk
stratiﬁcation allows for the identiﬁcation of low-risk patients in whom the risk-beneﬁt ratio is unfavorable, and
potentially for the identiﬁcation of patients at high VTE
risk in whom the beneﬁ
