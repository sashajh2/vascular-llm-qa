 highintensity exercise in improving claudication parameters,
provided the duration of exercise is extended in the lowintensity group to achieve similar levels of exercise exposure.110 However, use claudication end points of nearly
maximal pain vs onset of pain does appear to produce
greater changes in distance to onset and maximal pain.108
Data supporting nearly maximal pain during exercise are
derived from time to maximal claudication pain achieved
with treadmill testing and may actually underestimate bene
