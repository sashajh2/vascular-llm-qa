 repeated for
both legs (DP and PT signals) and both arms. The arm pressure must be measured with
the Doppler probe and the manual blood pressure cuff. To calculate an ABI, the higher
ankle pressure (DP or PT) is divided by the highest arm pressure (left or right). Note
that the higher arm pressure is used to calculate the ABI for both legs. For this specific

90

case, the highest arm pressure is 150. To
