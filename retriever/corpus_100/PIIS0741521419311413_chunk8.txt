First, we learned that the diagnosis of CLTI requires a
thorough history and physical examination by an experienced vascular physician, as well as combination of tests,
including noninvasive physiologic studies, followed by
either duplex imaging or cross-sectional imaging using
computed tomography angiography or magnetic
resonance angiography. Catheter angiography and intravascular ultrasound, in most cases, should be reserved to
document anatomy before treatment and should not be
used for making the diagnosis
