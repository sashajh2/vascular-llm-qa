axel is lipophilic and remains active in the vessel wall following the procedure, preventing
neointimal hyperplasia and improving patency.The impetus for using a drug-eluting stent or
balloon in place of a standard stent or balloon is to decrease the chances of vascular remodeling
following the procedure that may lead to restenosis.
In contrast to drug-eluting stents, drug-eluting balloons have the advantage of not leaving
hardware in the vessel after intervention.
