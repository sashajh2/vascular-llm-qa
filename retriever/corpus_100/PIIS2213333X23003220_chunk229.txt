compression at the level of the ankle and lightest at the
top provides the most favorable hemodynamic proÔ¨Åle
for reducing limb edema. Stockings are constructed in
various lengths, such as knee high or thigh high, with
variable levels of compression. Compression levels
range from I to III, with I representing the lowest level of
compression and III the highest. Similarly, elastic
stockings vary in compressive properties based on the
length and type of bandage used
