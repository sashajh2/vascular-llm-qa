 the operating room under general anesthesia and a completion aortogram
was just taken. A late blush is noted in the sac, seemingly arising from a lumbar artery.
What kind of endoleak would this suggest is present?
A. Type Ia endoleak; blood is filling the sac from the proximal extent of the stent graft.
B. Type III endoleak; blood is filling the sac from the middle and can appear to be coming
from a lumbar artery.
