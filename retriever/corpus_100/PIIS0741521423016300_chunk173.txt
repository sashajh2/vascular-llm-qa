) which were of low quality, reported
that TcPO2 can be used to predict the likelihood of
DFU healing,71e80 although there is variability in the
thresholds used. With a TcPO2 $ 25 mmHg the pre-test
probability of healing is increased by up to 45%, which
was higher than reported for the other tests in the
included studies. Regarding amputation, a value < 25
