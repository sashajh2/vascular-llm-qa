30
mmHg the pre-test probability of healing was
increased by up to 30%.71 Regarding major amputation, a value < 30 mmHg increases the probability of
major amputation by approximately 20%, which suggests a (somewhat) lower predictive capacity
compared with the ABI. In the three studies identiﬁed,
there was inconsistent and insufﬁcient evidence for the
use of the TBI to predict either healing
