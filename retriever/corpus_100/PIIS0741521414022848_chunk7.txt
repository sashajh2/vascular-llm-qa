 likelihood of sustained efﬁcacy for at least 2 years is suggested as a
benchmark. Anatomic patency (freedom from restenosis) is considered a prerequisite for sustained efﬁcacy of revascularization
in IC. Endovascular approaches are favored for most candidates with aortoiliac disease and for selected patients with femoropopliteal disease in whom anatomic durability is expected to meet this minimum threshold. Conversely, caution is warranted in
the use
