 an audible bruit in the neck may be an
appropriate indication for carotid imaging in selected
neurologically asymptomatic patients. Among patients
with a neck bruit, the prevalence of carotid stenosis of
more than 75% is 1.2%.30 However, the presence of a
neck bruit did not predict carotid stenosis of more than
60% in an asymptomatic patient population.30 These observations
