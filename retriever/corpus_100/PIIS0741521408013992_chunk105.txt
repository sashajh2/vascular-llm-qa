where a normal palpable pulse is identified to preserve more
proximal sites of inflow for future accesses. Therefore, in
patients with a palpable posterior branch of the radial artery
pulse, an autogenous posterior radial branch– cephalic direct wrist access (snuffbox) should be considered. In patients with a nonpalpable posterior branch of the radial
artery pulse but a palpable radial artery pulse at the wrist, an
autogenous radial– cep
