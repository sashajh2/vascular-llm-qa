 of the skin, subcutaneous tissue fibrosis (known as lipodermatosclerosis), and eventually,
ulceration.
Incompetence of the valves in the superficial venous system allows for retrograde fow of blood,
which is called “refux.” Failure of valves located at the junctions of the deep and superficial
systems can be a source of refux leading to CVI. For example, the great saphenous vein (GSV)
drains into the fem
