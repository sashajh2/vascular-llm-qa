 of fuoroscopic exposure. (Rial and Vañó 2021) During endovascular procedures, the operating
surgeon can control these factors by:
1. Pulse imaging: Instead of continuously scanning the patient, the surgeon can pulsate
images (i.e. shoot several plain x-rays). This approach reduces scatter and lowers overall
exposure. It’s especially effective when high temporal resolution isn’t necessary.
2. Collimator use: The surgeon can use the
