assessment of plaque structure may allow the identification
of a subgroup of asymptomatic carotid stenoses with a
4.5-fold increase in the risk of developing ipsilateral neurologic symptoms compared with those with a similar degree
of stenosis, which will reduce the number of patients requiring intervention to prevent one stroke. At present,
however, this type of plaque analysis66,67 is not widely
available and requires further prospective evaluation to
determine its ultimate clinical utility.
