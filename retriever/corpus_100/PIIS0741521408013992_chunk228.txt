of a prosthetic AV access to a secondary
autogenous AV access.
We suggest that a plan and protocol for eventual
conversion of forearm prosthetic access to a secondary
autogenous AV access should be put in place at the
presence of any sign of failing forearm prosthetic AV
access, or after the first failure (GRADE 2, very lowquality evidence).
We suggest two strategies for transitioning suitable
prosthetic AV access to secondary autogenous access
before abandoning a functional prosthetic
