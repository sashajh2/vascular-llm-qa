 abdominal aorta in addition to the
neck and chest.58 Advances in imaging techniques,
including electrocardiography-gated CTA, have been

the thoracic aorta.59
Recommendation 4: If TEVAR is being considered, we
recommend Ô¨Åne-cut (#0.25 mm) CTA of the entire aorta
as well as of the iliac and femoral arteries.
