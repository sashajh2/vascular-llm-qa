A recent study Regan et al326 proposed that the composition and properties of the foam, including bubble size
and gaseous components, may indeed contribute to the
potential for microcirculatory obstruction and cerebral
ischemia. The authors tested an ultralow nitrogen polidocanol endovenous microfoam with controlled bubble size
and density and found that patients treated with foamed
liquid sclerosants are commonly exposed to cerebrovascular gas bubbles
