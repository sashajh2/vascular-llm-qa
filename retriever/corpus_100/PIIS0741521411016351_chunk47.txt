 was also effective in reducing stroke risk in
patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis ⬎60%, although the stroke risk inherent in an asymptomatic stenosis
was much less than that in a symptomatic lesion. It follows
then that neurologically symptomatic patients and neurologically asymptomatic patients at high risk for harboring a
carotid stenosis of ⱖ60% would be candidates for carotid
bifurcation
