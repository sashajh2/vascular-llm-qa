 associated with
increased operative risk.
Anatomic factors to consider with CAS are related to
access issues. Successful CAS requires remote access of the
ICA artery using a stable platform to avoid the intravascular
motion of sheaths, stents, and protection devices during
the procedure. Anatomic factors that may complicate this
process include aortoiliac tortuosity, a sharply angulated
