 many patients with IC may
still beneÔ¨Åt from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
(ACEIs) for other conditions such as hypertension and
congestive heart failure, which are common in patients

with PAD. ACEIs remain contraindicated in individuals
with known renal artery stenosis. Further research is
needed to determine if ACEIs have a useful role in the
treatment of walking impairment or leg symptoms associated with IC.
