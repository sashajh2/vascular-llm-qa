 the need to occlude both the common
and external carotid artery, and the need to establish venous
access for continuous flow reversal. Proximal and distal
occlusion devices may both be problematic in patients with
poor intracranial collateral circulation because they mandate cessation—and sometimes reversal— of antegrade flow
in the ICA. This situation is generally encountered in ⱕ5%
of patients and may be managed by short intermittent
inflation times.
