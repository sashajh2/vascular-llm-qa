��ndings with those of DU and found that
the HHD sensitivity to detect reﬂux was only 73% at the
saphenofemoral junction (SFJ), 77% at the saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ), and 51% for thigh perforator veins.
Thus, treatment determined using HHD ultrasound
would have left residual sites of reﬂux in 24% of the cases.
