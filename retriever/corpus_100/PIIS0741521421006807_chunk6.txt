 clinical risk, repair
can be deferred until the PAA has become
$30 mm, especially in the absence of thrombus.
Level of recommendation: grade 2 (weak); quality
of evidence: C (low)

3. We suggest that for patients with a PAA <20 mm, in
the presence of thrombus and clinical suspicion of embolism or imaging evidence of poor distal runoff, repair
should be considered to prevent thromboembolic
complications
