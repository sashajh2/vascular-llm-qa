 should be aspirated to prevent embolization
when the EPD is withdrawn.366 An aspiration catheter
with a side port might be needed to evacuate the standing column of debris.
Distal occlusion devices. Distal occlusion devices are
not commonly used and have largely been abandoned
in current practice. Similar to distal Ô¨Ålters, a distal occlusion device initially requires the crossing of the lesion,
which can result in increased embolization. Also,
