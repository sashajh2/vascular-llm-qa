 stenosis of 70% or greater is a
peak systolic velocity (PSV) of 275 cm/s or more, whereas
200 cm/s or more indicates a similar stenosis of the CA
with no ﬂow in either vessel consistent with an occlusion.
These criteria for the SMA were associated with a sensitivity of 92%, speciﬁcity of 96%, positive predictive value
(PPV) of 8
