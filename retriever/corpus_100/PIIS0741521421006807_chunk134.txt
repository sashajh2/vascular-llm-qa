 vessels. Their
study resulted in consideration of early intervention,
even for PAAs <20 mm, when mural thrombus is present. However, no prospective evidence is available to
further support this. Several studies have otherwise indicated that >70% of PAAs will contain some degree of
thrombus and will form mural thrombus as the PAA enlarges. It remains controversial whether aneurysmal
degeneration results in thrombus formation or if
thrombus formation
