alous venous anatomy; and presence of calcium,
thrombus, or atherosclerotic debris.
The location of the clamp site should take into consideration the proximal extension of the aneurysm as well
as the structural integrity of the aortic wall. Ideally, the
clamp site should be relatively free of thrombus, atherosclerotic debris, or calciÔ¨Åcation. Other important considerations include presence of concomitant visceral aortic
disease and unusual ven
