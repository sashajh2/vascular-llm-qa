 general, a transthoracic
approach provides signiﬁcantly better long-term patency
than the cervical approach.518 However, these reconstructions require invasive incisions and longer recovery.
When there is a patent arch vessel to act as inﬂow, cervical open reconstructions may be less invasive, but they
also carry a risk of nerve or thoracic duct injury. Prosthetic
conduit can be used with excellent long term patency if
