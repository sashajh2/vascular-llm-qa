 compared with UGFS. Thermal interventions were associated with lower generic
quality of life scores and an increased risk of adverse events when compared with CAC or n-butyl cyanoacrylate (low certainty). Thermal interventions were associated with a lower risk of recurrent incompetence when compared with UGFS and
an increased risk of recurrent incompetence than CAC. The evidence for great saphenous vein ablation alone to manage
perforator disease was inconclusive.
Conclusions: The current
