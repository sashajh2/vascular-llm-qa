osis and the associated cost, hospitalization, morbidity, and burdens and lower values on inconvenience and cost of surveillance and monitoring. In
addition, considering the low costs and harms associated
with clinical monitoring, access flow, and static dialysis
venous pressure measurements, we suggested these methods for routine surveillance to detect access dysfunction,
reserving DU scans for patients with accesses that show
symptoms and signs suggestive of impending access failure.
In these patients, the benefits of imaging studies are likely
