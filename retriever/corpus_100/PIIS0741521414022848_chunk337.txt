ication remains unclear. Treatment of isolated infrapopliteal disease for relief of claudication is not advised.
In patients with multisegment disease, the more proximal
disease should be treated Ô¨Årst and usually results in
improvement in symptoms without extending treatment
to the more distal arteries. Endovascular interventions are
generally safe, with infrequent complications and lower
levels of morbidity, mortality, and an earlier return to
normal function than surgical bypass.
