vasive bedside tests (ABI,
TBI, CWD) can be applied by a wide range of

practitioners, in particular in settings where people are
treated in secondary care or specialised outpatient foot
clinics. These tests have low resource requirements relative to other methods of diagnosing PAD such as CDUS
and angiography. These factors are likely to increase equity in healthcare access and make the tests feasible and
acceptable for both the person having the tests and
healthcare providers
