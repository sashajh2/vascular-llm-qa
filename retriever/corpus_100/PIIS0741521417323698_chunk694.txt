raft limb thrombosis because of
difﬁculty in advancing the catheter beyond the occluded
segment, concerns related to dislodging or disrupting the
sealing zones, and the presence of stents, which may
interfere with balloon thrombectomy. The underlying
cause of the thrombosis must be identiﬁed and treated,
and if a mechanical cause for thrombosis cannot be
determined, femoral-femoral bypass should be considered.
