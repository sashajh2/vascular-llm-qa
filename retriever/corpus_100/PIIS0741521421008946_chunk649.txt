 intracerebral arteriography.
If, during local/regional anesthesia, neurologic changes
occur with test clamping of the artery, this is an indication for placement of an intra-arterial shunt. Neurologic
changes that occur during initial carotid clamping will
typically reverse with successful shunt placement. If they
do not, one must again consider the possibility that
intracerebral embolization has occurred.
