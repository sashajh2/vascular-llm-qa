let reactivity is not justifiable. The pharmacologic
response to clopidogrel also demonstrates significant interindividual variability.
Patients with reduced platelet inhibition in response to
clopidogrel appear to be at increased risk for cardiovascular
events. This resistance may result from reduced bioavailability, polymorphisms of cytochrome P450, additional
genetic variants, or increased platelet turnover.147 Prasugrel is an alternate platelet-inhibiting pharmacologic
