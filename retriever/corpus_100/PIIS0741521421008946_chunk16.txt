 reversible ischemic
neurologic deÔ¨Åcits. This term is no longer used because
most events lasting more than 24 hours are associated
with cerebral infarction and should therefore carry a
stroke diagnosis.
Advances in cerebral imaging yielded evidence that the
arbitrary 24-hour time period for diagnosing a TIA was
inaccurate, with up to 50% of patients showing brain
injury on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
