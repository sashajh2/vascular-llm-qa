 as distally in the arm
as possible where a normal palpable pulse is identified to
preserve more proximal arteries for future accesses. Therefore, when the radial artery pulse is palpable and is of a good
quality, a prosthetic radial–antecubital forearm straight access
is performed. If the radial artery pulse is nonpalpable and the
brachial artery pulse is, a prosthetic brachial–antecubital
forearm loop access is performed
