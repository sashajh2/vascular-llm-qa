 will require rigorous
validation in large datasets that are generalizable to the

broad heterogeneous chronic limb ischemia population.
Such validation could be done as part of a registry, and
plans are underway to begin this process within the SVS
Vascular Quality Initiative.72 We anticipate that within
2 years, we will be able to conﬁrm or re-assign patients
by WIfI classiﬁcation to the appropriate limb threat clinical
stage based on such registry data.
