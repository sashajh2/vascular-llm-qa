 The distance between these perforators and the medial edge of the tibia is 2 to 4 cm.66 (Fig 1).
Paratibial perforators connect the main GSV trunk with
the posterior tibial veins. In the distal thigh, perforators
of the femoral canal usually connect directly the GSV to
the femoral vein.
Venous valves
Bicuspid venous valves are important structures assisting unidirectional flow in the normal venous
