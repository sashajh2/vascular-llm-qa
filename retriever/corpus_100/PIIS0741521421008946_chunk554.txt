 therefore, decreasing risk of embolic
events. The RADCAR (Radial access for Carotid artery
stenting) study randomized patients to transradial (n ¼
130) and transfemoral (n ¼ 130) groups and showed no
differences in major adverse events and hospitalization
between the two approaches. However, with transradial
access, crossover and radiation dose were higher. Moreover, hospitalization was shorter with trans
