 evaluation, brain imaging, and
rapid evaluation of the carotid bifurcation is important
to optimize result. Brain imaging, most often by
diffusion-weighted MRI, allows rapid assessment of the
amount of brain infarcted and the amount at risk. After
brain imaging to exclude hemorrhage as an etiology
and to identify ischemic but viable brain, carotid imaging
by duplex ultrasound examination, CTA, or MRI should
be used to identify the
