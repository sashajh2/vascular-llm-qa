 and MAOD remain poorly deﬁned, although the potential adverse sequelae are well-known. Accordingly,
patients with CMI require revascularization to optimize
mesenteric perfusion. There is essentially no role for prolonged total parenteral nutrition given the associated
risks and prolonged attempts to optimize the nutritional
status before revascularization may be harmful. The SMA
is the optimal target for revascularization and

revascularization of the SMA alone is usually sufﬁcient
given the
