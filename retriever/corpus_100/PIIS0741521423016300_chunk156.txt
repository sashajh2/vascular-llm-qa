 diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene,
consider performing ankle pressures and ankle brachial index
(ABI) measurements to assist in the assessment of likelihood
of healing and amputation.
Ankle pressure and ABI are weak predictors of healing. A low
ankle pressure (e.g., < 50 mmHg) or ABI (e.g., < 0.5) may be
associated with greater likelihood of impaired healing and
greater likelihood of major amputation.
