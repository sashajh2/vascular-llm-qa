 palpation, auscultation, and monitoring for
prolonged bleeding after needle withdrawal) to detect access dysfunction (GRADE 1, very low-quality
evidence).
B. We suggest access flow monitoring or static dialysis
venous pressures for routine surveillance (GRADE
2, very low-quality evidence).
C. We suggest performing a Duplex ultrasound (DU)
study or contrast imaging study in accesses that
display clinical signs of dysfunction or abnormal
routine surveillance (GRADE 2, very
