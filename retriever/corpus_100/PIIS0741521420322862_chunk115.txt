ography demonstrated that a greater
than 50% stenosis of the IMA was associated with a
greater than 250 cm/s PSV with an accuracy of 95%,

whereas an IMA to aortic PSV ratio of greater than 4.0
had an accuracy of 93%.56 A second study used greater
than 200 cm/s as the criteria for a greater than 50% stenosis, but
