. Over time, the combination of lipids, immune cells,
and smooth muscle cell proliferation results in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. These
plaques narrow the arterial lumen, restricting blood fow. The build-up of plaques can lead to
stiffening and loss of elasticity in the arterial walls, further diminishing the arteryâ€™s ability to
dilate and maintain adequate blood fow.
As the arterial narrowing progresses, blood fow to the downstream tissues (e
