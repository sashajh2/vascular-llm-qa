 dissected through two separate
longitudinal incisions and the vein is passed through a
tunnel to perform the anastomosis.
Autogenous radialâ€“ cephalic forearm transposition. This
autogenous access is performed between the end of the
cephalic vein and the radial artery in the forearm. The
cephalic vein is identified at the wrist and mobilized to the
antecubital fossa. The radial artery may be identified within
the distal portion of
