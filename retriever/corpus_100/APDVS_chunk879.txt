 outperformed non-leaded safety glasses, with an average
reduction in dose of approximately 90.3%. (Waddell et al. 2016) This study is just one of
many that highlight the eﬀcacy of lead glasses in minimizing eye exposure during procedures
involving radiation.
Despite the significant reduction achieved with the use of lead safety glasses, there’s a caveat
regarding a false sense of security. Due to the scattering of radiation
