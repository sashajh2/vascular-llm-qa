in a specific location, at the prosthetic venous anastomosis.
In contrast, in autogenous access the stenosis can be located anywhere along the access vein used for needle puncture, and multiple stenoses are often present, thus highlighting the importance of complete access evaluation.
Prosthetic and autogenous accesses can both be plagued by
stenoses along the venous outflow tract, including central
veins on the same side.
Although venous stenoses are
