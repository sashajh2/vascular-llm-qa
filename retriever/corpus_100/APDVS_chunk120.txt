 of minimizing the risk of perioperative stroke. This patient
has asymptomatic bilateral severe carotid disease (right occlusion and left >80% stenosis). Therefore, to reduce the risk of perioperative stroke, current guidelines recommend
carotid revascularization prior or concomitant with the CABG. The patient does carry
one high risk criterion for TCAR (coronary disease requiring revascularization), however
this should not be performed after the CABG.
