 technique is recommended with advancing of the microsheath followed by
the 0.035 wire into distal CCA but staying short of the lesion.
Next, an 8F sheath is advanced over a 0.035 wire carefully
with gentle traction on the umbilical tape on the CCA. At
least two angiography views are performed through the
sheath to conÔ¨Årm proper position. Technical advantages of
this technique include ease of direct access
