 Accordingly,
we suggest that the term EHIT” be replaced by “ARTE.”
ARTE is an all-encompassing term that includes junctional extension associated with any ablation modality

including thermal, foam, mechanicochemical, and
cyanoacrylate ablation. This includes events previously
described as EHIT, postablation superﬁcial thrombus
extension, endovenous glue induced thrombosis, and
endovenous foam-induced thrombosis.
