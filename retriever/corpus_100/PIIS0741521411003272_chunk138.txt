 variations in venous flow, and waveform patterns at rest and
during flow augmentation in the common femoral veins
indicate proximal obstruction. Reflux can be elicited in two
ways: increased intra-abdominal pressure using a Valsalva
maneuver for the common femoral vein or the SFJ, or by
manual compression and release of the limb distal to the
point of examination. The first is more appropriate for
evaluation of reflux in the common fem
