 urgent drainage and debridement prior to objective documentation of foot perfusion. In such cases, the initial ischemia
status would be listed as U (Unknown). The ischemia grade would be added after drainage of infection. If ischemia was detected and
measured, but urgent drainage of infection was nonetheless required, the patient must be reclassiﬁed after control of infection prior to
revascularization. This process could be simpliﬁed as follows:
Group a: No infection
