ysms are being diagnosed with increased frequency.
These detailed imaging studies are allowing an
improved ability for vascular surgeons to identify asymptomatic lesions and an enhanced potential for preoperative or preprocedural planning and elective treatment of
these aneurysms. Improvements in endovascular therapies have also allowed an enhanced ability for treatment
of these often anatomically complex lesions with a large
variety of individualized and precise catheter-based
therapies.
