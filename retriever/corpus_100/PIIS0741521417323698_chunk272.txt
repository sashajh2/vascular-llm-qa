by formal segregation analyses.170 Genetic predisposition
likely represents small contributions from a large
number of risk alleles, with the effect dependent on the
population under consideration as well as relevant environmental considerations, such as cigarette smoking.171
Most genomic studies have investigated singlenucleotide polymorphisms in genes related to AAA
pathogenesis. Potential AAA-related single-nucleotide
polymorphisms have been identiÔ¨Å
