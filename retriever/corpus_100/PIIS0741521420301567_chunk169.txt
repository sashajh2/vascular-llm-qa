number of open repairs and an increase in the number
of endovascular repairs. Analysis of in-hospital outcome
events revealed similar mortality rates (1.1% endovascular
vs 3.3% open) and variable patterns of perioperative

(P ¼ .053) and infectious (P ¼ .053) complications,
whereas endovascular repair was associated with more
