uminal pressure measurements can be
helpful to further interrogate any residual stenoses or lesions. The postoperative management after endovascular revascularization for CMI is comparable with other
catheter-based procedures, although it is possible for patients to develop multiple organ problems from the
ischemia/reperfusion injury similar to that seen after
open revascularization. All patients should be maintained on antiplatelet agents and a cholesterollowering agent, preferentially a
