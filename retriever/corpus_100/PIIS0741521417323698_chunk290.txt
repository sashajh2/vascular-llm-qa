 units and absence of radiation or administration of nephrotoxic contrast material with ultrasound
have made it the preferred technique for aneurysm
screening and surveillance.193-195 However, aneurysm
diameter measurements, whether through the use of
CT or ultrasound imaging, are most reliable and reproducible when standardized measurement techniques
are used and the maximum transverse dimension
measured orthogonal to the vessel axis is reported. Moreover, it is essential that ultrasound
