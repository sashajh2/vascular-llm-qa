 require revascularization at the time of an
open aortic procedure, as summarized elsewhere in

(or the iliac limb) is feasible for transperitoneal open repairs. This is also feasible for retroperitoneal aortic repairs
although it usually involves entering the peritoneal cavity
and dissecting the proximal SMA after mobilizing the
duodenum.
