 in the presence of ABI 0.9 e 1.3; TBI $
0.70; and triphasic or biphasic pedal Doppler waveforms.
5. In a person with diabetes without a foot ulcer in whom a
non-emergency invasive foot procedure is being considered,
peripheral artery disease should be excluded by performing
assessment of pedal Doppler waveforms in combination with
ankle brachial index and toe brachial index.
