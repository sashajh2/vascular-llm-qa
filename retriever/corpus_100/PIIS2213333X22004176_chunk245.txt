 resulted in a higher closure rate
at 6 weeks and lower recurrence at 1 year than open surgery. The quality of evidence was low to suggest the use of
physician-compounded UGFS over surgery. Additional
RCTs with longer follow-up are needed to deﬁne the
optimal treatment of SSV ablation. However, the lack of
neurologic injury after nonthermal ablation is promising
and appears to be of considerable clinical beneﬁt.
