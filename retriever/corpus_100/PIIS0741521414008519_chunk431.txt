2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]
There is theoretical, preclinical, and limited clinical evidence to support the use of electrical stimulation for the
treatment of VLUs.266 However, few studies of electrical
stimulation focus solely on VLUs. Also, there is little consistency in the parameters of treatment, including variability in type of electrical current, settings, treatment
times, and preferred waveforms, making comparisons
impossible.267,268 For
