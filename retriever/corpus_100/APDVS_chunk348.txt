ogenesis involves the enlargement and maturation of existing collateral
vessels into larger arteries. These processes are driven by growth factors and signaling molecules like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor
(FGF), and various cytokines. As stated previously, they promote the proliferation and
migration of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, leading to the formation of new
blood vessels and the remodeling of existing ones.
