 have a catheter than those who had three
or more visits.24
In addition, predialysis nephrology referral is associated
with a shorter duration of catheter use after the initiation of
dialysis and with a greater likelihood of autogenous access
placement.25 Nevertheless, even among patients referred to
a nephrologist well in advance of the need for dialysis, most
start dialysis with a catheter rather than a permanent vascular access.2
