Their application in medical imaging includes plain X-ray films, CT scans, and fuoroscopy.
Lead is effective in shielding against x-rays due to its density.
The position of the x-ray emitting source of the the C-arm used for endovascular procedures
is at the bottom of the arm, beneath the patient and the operating room table. This is the
location of highest exposure.
As the X-ray source emits radiation, radiation scatter occurs, moving upward and outward
from the source.
