 stroke risk. In general, the rates of stroke,
myocardial infarction (MI), and death have been used
when comparing CAS against CEA. In most clinical trials
comparing CAS with CEA, stroke, MI, and death have
been given equal weight in determining a composite
endpoint to test overall efÔ¨Åcacy. Data from the CREST (carotid revascularization endarterectomy vs stenting trial),9
however, indicated that stroke has a
