but many have extrapolated DUS protocols and criteria for
peak systolic velocity (PSV) and velocity ratio (Vr) developed

after EVT. Duplex ultrasound can localize and grade the
presence and degree of stenosis in the FP segment after angioplasty alone as well as after stent placement, particularly in
the SFA, where authors have correlated duplex Ô¨Åndings with
