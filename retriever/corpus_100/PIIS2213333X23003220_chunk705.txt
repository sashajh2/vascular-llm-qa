ablation is low, with the combined incidence of ARTE,
DVT, and pulmonary embolism (PE) being 1.3% to
1.7%.234-236 Given this low incidence, the potential

magnitude of effect of any intervention such as routine
ultrasound surveillance after venous ablation would be
classiﬁed as “trivial” to “small” (<5 events per 1000
