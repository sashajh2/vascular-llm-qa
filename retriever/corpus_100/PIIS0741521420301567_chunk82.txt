 with segmental
arterial mediolysis. Level of Recommendation: Grade 2
(Weak), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate).
5.1: We suggest interval surveillance (ie, every 1224 months) with axial imaging (ie, CTA or MRA) for cases
of segmental medial arteriolysis in light of reported cases
of rapid arterial transformation and to monitor regression
in cases of polyarteritis nodosa. Level of Recommendation: Grade
