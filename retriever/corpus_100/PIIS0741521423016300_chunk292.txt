 extent of tissue loss were reported infrequently. Heterogeneity of the included studies was
found to be high, preventing meta-analysis of data. This
is likely to be due to high variability in participants and
wound stage (extent of tissue loss, severity of ischaemia,
presence of infection). Comparison of primary outcomes
(healing and amputation) or adverse events is therefore
problematic. Based on the available data it appears
