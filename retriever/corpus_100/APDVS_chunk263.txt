 is expanding. Therefore, patients who have undergone EVAR should undergo CTA at one month and 12 months post-operatively. A six-month scan is indicated in
the presence of a persistent endoleak observed on the one-month scan. If the endograft is in
a good position without complications, yearly interval follow-up with concomitant imaging is
warranted. Open repairs can similarly develop problems that require repair, albeit with less
frequency, and hence need surveillance imaging
