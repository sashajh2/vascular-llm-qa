 catheter-based thrombolysis and
thrombectomy may be considered. This allows use of
cerebral angiography to evaluate distal embolization as
well as the use of stent retrieval thrombectomy.
Carotid artery dissection
Dissection can be largely avoided with meticulous
techniques. This complication should be identiﬁed on
the completion angiogram. If the dissection occurs
distally and is ﬂow limiting, a second st
