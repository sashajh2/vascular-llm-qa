 these studies and others have
demonstrated revised grafts have excellent long-term
patency comparable to grafts never undergoing revision.253,254 None of the studies included patients treated
for claudication. Whether the magnitude of the beneﬁt of
improved graft patency achieved in CLI patients, followed
with duplex-based surveillance, would be comparable in patients undergoing vein bypass for claudication remains unknown. Nevertheless, the signiﬁcance and consistency
