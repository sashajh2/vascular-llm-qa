ion, and stent deployment. Technical issues related to
carotid stenting include achieving a stable platform for the
procedure, use of embolic protection devices, stent dilation
before deployment, stent selection, and postdeployment
dilation.
Stable sheath access in the proximal CCA is required.
This depends on appropriate patient selection, as described
above. Once a stable platform is obtained, a decision must
be made about use of a cerebral protection device. In
