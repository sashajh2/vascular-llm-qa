description of how to perform these tests can be found in
the NKF-KDOQI Clinical Practice Guidelines.9 The clinical value of each test is summarized below:
1. Access blood flow measurements. Access blood flow is
the best determinant of access function. As a prosthetic
access develops progressive stenosis, access blood flow falls
progressively. A number of studies have shown that a
prosthetic access blood flow rate of ‚¨ç600 mL/min, or
