Among patients with documented carotid artery disease in the Cardiovascular Health Study, elevated fasting
blood glucose level was associated with increased stroke

was associated with a doubling of the stroke risk.74 However, a recent meta-analysis of nine randomized clinical
trials and nearly 60,000 patients did not conÔ¨Årm that
tight control of glucose levels decreased stroke risk.75
