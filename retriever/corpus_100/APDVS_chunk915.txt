ocytic leukemia (CLL). (Leuraud et al. 2015)
 Specifically, the study highlighted a direct correlation between cumulative red bone

 Their findings indicated that the relative risk of leukemia mortality was approximately

While we wonâ€™t delve into the intricate details of these findings in this chapter, they underscore
