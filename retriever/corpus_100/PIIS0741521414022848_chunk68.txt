 patients who are being considered for revascularization, we suggest using
physiologic noninvasive studies, such as segmental pressures and pulse volume recordings, to
aid in the quantiﬁcation of arterial insufﬁciency and help localize the level of obstruction.
In symptomatic patients in whom revascularization treatment is being considered, we
recommend anatomic imaging studies, such as arterial duplex ultrasound, CTA, MRA, and
contrast arteriography.
