 and remediation with
either an endovascular or open approach results in
improved outcomes in terms of symptoms, survival,
and/or quality of life. DUS examination is the optimal surveillance imaging study after revascularization although
the criteria for the native arteries tend to overestimate
the degree of stenosis (ie, 70% stenosis in treated arteries
associated with higher PSV and EDV). CTA can help to
