 DUS.
Many single-institution series and one large prospective
multi-institution series demonstrated improved vein graft
patency for patients treated for CLI with a surveillance
program using duplex ultrasound detection of graft stenoses.248-252 In addition to a signiÔ¨Åcant improvement in primary and assisted primary patency of vein grafts monitored
with a DUS-based program, these studies and others have
demonstrated revised grafts have excellent long-term
patency
