 can be categorized by the means of deployment.
Self-expanding stents use a recoil mechanism during deployment to achieve a set diameter
using stored energy from the packing of the stent.
Key characteristics of self-expanding stents:

Flexible
Low profile
Deformable
Low radial force (lower dissection risk)

Balloon-expandable stents are packaged around a balloon. The surgeon uses the balloon
inside the stent to achieve a specific diameter based on the pressure used to infate the
