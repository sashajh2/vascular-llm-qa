 IV, a) that focused
on amputation risk. Table IV, b is quite informative for
determining the likelihood a given patient will require
revascularization. As with amputation risk, the ICC71 was
slightly lower but still quite acceptable with a single
measures coefﬁcient of .76 and an average measures coefﬁcient of .97.
The 16 possible combinations in ischemia 0 are
unlikely to require revascularization.
