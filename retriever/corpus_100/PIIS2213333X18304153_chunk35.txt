animal model.11 To achieve this goal, the external pressure should exceed the intravenous pressure. The intravenous pressure depends mainly on the body position,
corresponding to the height of the blood column between the point of measurement and the right side of
the heart. The pressure in leg veins is very low when
patients are lying horizontal. In this position, magnetic
resonance imaging has conÔ¨Årmed that a compression
