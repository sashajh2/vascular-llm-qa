between the two anesthetic approaches.
An abundant literature exists on the indications identifying patients at risk of flow-related ischemia during CEA

Factors associated with increased risk of cerebral ischemia
during carotid cross-clamping, and therefore the increased likelihood that a shunt will be needed, during
