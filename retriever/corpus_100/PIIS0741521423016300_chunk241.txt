as also stated in the GVG, an indication for revascularisation, unless contraindicated or technically not
possible. There is retrospective evidence demonstrating that a delay in revascularisation of more than
two weeks in people with diabetes results in increased
risk of limb loss.102 This is supported by observational
research demonstrating that a shorter time to revascularisation (< 8 weeks) is associated with a higher probability of DFU healing and lower likelihood of limb
loss.7
