 resulted in limb-threatening ischemia in
prosthetic grafts than in vein grafts. However, patients
with prosthetic graft thrombosis were less likely to present
with acute limb ischemia if they were receiving warfarin.239
In summary, available clinical evidence does not
conclusively support the use of antiplatelet agents to
improve lower extremity vein bypass graft patency,
although their use is still warranted to reduce future cardiovascular ischemic events and
