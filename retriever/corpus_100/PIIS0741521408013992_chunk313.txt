 others can be performed by onestage or two-stage techniques. A two-stage technique can
be used when the vein to be transposed has a small caliber
(‚¨ç4 mm), where simply anastomosing the end of the vein
to the artery would allow the vein to dilate before its
transposition in the second stage of the two-stage technique.121 Before the second stage is performed, DU study
of the vein can confirm its adequacy. The second
