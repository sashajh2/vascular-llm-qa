 to those obtained after endovascular or open venous surgery. The Committee recommended that there was an urgent need for wellperformed, large RCTs comparing adverse effects and longterm saphenous occlusion rates of surgery, endovenous

should include detailed analyses of safety and costs and should
also evaluate the QOL of patients who undergo treatment
using any of these procedures.
