 evidence exists, compression
may decrease long-term costs associated with CVI. In a
Markov decision analysis, use of compression was associated with an estimated savings of $17,000 during a patient’s lifetime.512 However, this study used a
hypothetical patient with C5 disease and did not directly
assess lower clinical classes of venous reﬂux. Regardless,
this study provides support for use of compression in those
at risk for VLU without
