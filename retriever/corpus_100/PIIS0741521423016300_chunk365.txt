The targets discussed in this text are based on reduction of cardiovascular events, but it should be noted
that this is a composite endpoint and the deﬁnition between trials differs. MALE is also sometimes differently
deﬁned and the evidence for reducing lower limb events
in persons with diabetes, PAD, and a foot ulcer by pharmacological treatment is scarce. For this reason, a speciﬁc recommendation on this topic could not be made.
