unt blood away from the
axial vein, thereby preventing the main trunk from dilating
sufficiently to accept dialysis cannulae and to support adequate dialysis. However, before simple surgical ligation or
endoluminal coil occlusion, the main trunk must be studied
angiographically or with DU scanning to ensure that the
side branch has not dilated secondary to a stenosis in the
main trunk increasing resistance to axial flow. Such a lesion
must be addressed
