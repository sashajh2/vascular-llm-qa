 ischemic area as
rapidly as possible.
In each of these clinical scenarios, expeditious clinical evaluation, brain imaging, and rapid evaluation of the
carotid bifurcation is important in optimizing results.
Brain imaging, most often by diffusion-weighted MRI,
allows a rapid assessment of the amount of brain infracted and the amount at risk, whereas CDUS imaging
can assess the status of the bifurcation. As will be discussed below, this information dictates the branch points
