 surrounding tissues, including destruction of the dermis
with eventual skin changes and ulcer formation.48
MMPs can be released as a result of mechanical stretch
(and hence during conditions of venous hypertension)
and have signiÔ¨Åcant effects on the endothelium, venous
smooth muscle, and adventitia.66,67 MMPs have been
demonstrated in rat venous tissue to cause venous dilation by several mechanisms, including hyperpolarization
