 and central veins.
B. Remote secondary autogenous AV access construction. This strategy involves a physical examination
and vessel mapping in a patient with a failing prosthetic
access where an imaging study has shown that a suitable
outflow vein is not available. In this situation, evaluation of
the vessels of the contralateral extremity should be performed. If suitable remote vessels are identified, a secondary
autogenous AV access construction should be undertaken as
soon as feasible to avoid the need for long
