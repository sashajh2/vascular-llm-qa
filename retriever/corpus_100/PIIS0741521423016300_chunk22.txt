 combination with
ankle brachial index and toe brachial index.

Prognosis

6. In a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene, consider
performing ankle pressures and ankle brachial index (ABI)
measurements to assist in the assessment of likelihood of healing
and amputation.
Ankle pressure and ABI are weak predictors of healing. A low
ankle pressure (e.g., < 50 mmHg) or ABI (e.g
