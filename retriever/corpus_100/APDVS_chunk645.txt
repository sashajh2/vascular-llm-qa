treatments, employing techniques such as mechanochemical ablation (MOCA), cyanoacrylate
adhesive, and sclerosant foams. MOCA combines mechanical damage with the direct injection
of a sclerosant to close the vein, enhancing the effectiveness of the chemical agent (Boersma
et al. 2014a). Cyanoacrylate adhesive, injected directly into the vein, promotes vessel closure
through infammation and subsequent fib
