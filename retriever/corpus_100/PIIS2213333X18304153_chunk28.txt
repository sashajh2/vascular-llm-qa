The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system (Table) was
used throughout the entire process of review and synthesis.2,3 The quality of evidence was rated high when
additional research was considered very unlikely to
change conÔ¨Ådence in the estimate of effect; moderate
when further research was likely to have an important
impact on the estimate of effect; or low when further
research was very likely to change the estimate of the
effect.
