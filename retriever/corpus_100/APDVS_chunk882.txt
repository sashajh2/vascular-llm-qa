Imaging Technique
Now that we’ve covered both radiation equipment and safety gear, it’s crucial to underscore the
importance of imaging technique. This concept is critical because it addresses the multifaceted
aspects of minimizing radiation exposure during procedures.
The radiation dose depends on both the intensity of imaging and the duration of fuoroscopic exposure. (Rial and Vañó 2021) During
