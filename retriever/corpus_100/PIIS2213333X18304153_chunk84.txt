 using the 810-nm diode laser,
compression was applied for 1 week postoperatively
using 20 to 30 mm Hg stockings. Complete resolution
of varicosities was noted in 42% of patients at 1 month,
with a reduction of varicose vein size in 56% of patients.
There were no complications related to the compression
therapy.30 Another study used the 1470-nm laser.
