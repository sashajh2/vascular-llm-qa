tremendous amount of redundancy in the mesenteric circulation, and, accordingly, the symptoms of CMI do not
typically develop unless both the CA and SMA have hemodynamically signiﬁcant lesions (>70%). However, it is
possible to have symptoms consistent with CMI and disease isolated to a single mesenteric vessel, typically the
SMA. MAOD, in contradistinction to CMI, is relatively common and affects a
