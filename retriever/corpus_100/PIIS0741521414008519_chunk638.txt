Typically, limbs that go on to ulcerate have signiﬁcantly
worse ejection fraction and increased residual volume fraction by air plethysmography.505 Improvement in calf muscle function (ejection fraction) and reduced residual
volume fraction are the primary mechanisms of compression.506,507 A recent meta-analysis showed that leg symptoms, primarily pain and edema, are also signiﬁcantly
improved with use
