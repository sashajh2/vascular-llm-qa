, shorter length of hospital stay, and lower
hospital costs, although the rates of recurrent symptoms
and reinterventions are higher. The longer term survival
rates are comparable between the open and endovascular approaches, although there seems to be trend toward
a higher perioperative mortality in the open cohort. The
comparable longer term survival seems to suggest that
endovascular failures and higher rates of recurrent symptoms are not leading an increased rate of death from
AMI. Fortunately, the end
