or local anesthesia. Whereas a number of retrospective
studies suggest that the type of anesthetic inﬂuences
operative time, length of hospital stay, and risk of
morbidity, a mortality beneﬁt has yet to be identiﬁed.
In a retrospective analysis of nearly 4000 patients in the
EUROSTAR registry, local anesthesia was associated
with shorter operative times, reduced ICU admission,
shorter hospital stay, and fewer systemic complications.56
