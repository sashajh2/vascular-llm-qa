peak AAA wall stress.210-212
Hall and colleagues have suggested that rupture is
imminent above a critical aortic wall stress, predicted
by the law of Laplace and maximum AAA diameter.209
Several other investigators subsequently demonstrated
that wall stress is highly dependent on AAA shape rather
than diameter alone.210-216 With ultrasound-based
