4 Thrombolysis may
be given by systemic (intravenous) or local (intracranial)
routes, and both routes are used in some cases to facilitate
rapid reperfusion.234
Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator
(r-tPA) has the advantage of rapid onset of administration
but the potential disadvantage of longer time to reperfusion. Administration of r-tPA into the intracranial thrombus requires assembling a
