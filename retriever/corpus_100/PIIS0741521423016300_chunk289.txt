 amputation outcomes for
direct and indirect endovascular revascularisation show
that if direct revascularisation is possible, DFU healing
time and major amputation may be reduced compared
with indirect revascularisation. There is inadequate evidence to determine whether direct revascularisation is
superior to indirect revascularisation to prevent minor
amputation.116 Indirect revascularisation with collaterals
was associated with wound healing and limb salvage
outcomes which were similar to
