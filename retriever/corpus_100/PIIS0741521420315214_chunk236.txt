Recommendation 17: We recommend increasing
perfusion pressure through controlled hypertension
(mean arterial pressure >90 mm Hg) as a component
of a spinal cord protection protocol in patients at high
risk of SCI because of extensive coverage length
(>15 cm), poor hypogastric perfusion (occluded or significantly stenosed hypogastric arteries), or coverage of
important collaterals (subclavian/hypogastric arteries).
