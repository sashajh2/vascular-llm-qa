alone for the treatment of de novo lesion. Balloonexpandable covered stents seem to have better longer
term patency, presumably owing to the prevention of tissue ingrowth through the interstices of the stent by the
fabric. A completion imaging study is an integral part
of any endovascular intervention and should be performed routinely. Intravascular ultrasound examination
and/or intraluminal pressure measurements can be
helpful to further interrogate any residual stenoses or lesions
