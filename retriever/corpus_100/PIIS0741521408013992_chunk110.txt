 in the arm as possible where a palpable pulse is
identified to preserve more proximal sites of inflow for
future accesses. Therefore, when a radial artery pulse is
palpable, an autogenous radial– basilic forearm transposition is performed. If the radial artery pulse is nonpalpable
but the ulnar artery pulse is palpable, an autogenous ulnar–
basilic forearm transposition is performed. If the radial and
ulnar artery pulses are
