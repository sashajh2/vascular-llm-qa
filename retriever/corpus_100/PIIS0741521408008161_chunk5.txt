we suggest carotid artery stenting as a potential alternative to carotid endarterectomy (GRADE 2 recommendation, low
quality evidence). In asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe carotid stenosis (>60%), we recommend carotid

quality evidence). We recommend against carotid artery stenting for asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe
