 Freeman-Tukey arcsine
method, and pooled using the DerSimonian and Laird
random effects model. The random effects model was
chosen a priori because of anticipated heterogeneity
across study populations and settings. Heterogeneity
was evaluated using the I2 index and Cochrane Q test. All
statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.1
(The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria).
