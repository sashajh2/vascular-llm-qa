%.). An even greater stroke
risk reduction was seen in patients with >70% carotid stenosis (9% CEA vs. 26% medical
management).
 Current management of patients with symptomatic >50% carotid stenosis who are
low/standard risk is carotid endarterectomy over transfemoral carotid stenting (TFCAS),
as there are no studies to date which have shown benefit of TFCAS.
