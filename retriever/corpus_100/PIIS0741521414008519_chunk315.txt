 potential venous outﬂow obstruction, diagnosis should be conﬁrmed by contrast
venography and intravascular ultrasound. Imaging with
intravascular ultrasound with cross-sectional views of the
vein and adjacent structures has high diagnostic accuracy
in determining presence of iliocaval thrombus burden or
iliocaval compression due to May-Thurner syndrome or
other adjacent structures, which may have bearing on additional therapeutic options.181-183
