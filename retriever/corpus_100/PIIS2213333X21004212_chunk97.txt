 duplex scanning.24
The second prospective study25 had a low risk of bias
and compared DUS with HHD examination complemented by physical examination. The study demonstrated that the accuracy of HHD was 71% at the SFJ
and in the GSV (previously called the long saphenous
vein). However, in 90% of limbs, duplex scanning did
not affect surgical management (Supplementary
Table IV, online only).
