Answer
B. Endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT).
Discussion: Endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT) is a potential complication of
endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), where heat generated by the laser can extend thrombus into the deep venous system. Monitoring with duplex ultrasound post-procedure
helps detect EHIT early. Allergic reactions, superficial wound infections, and hypotension are less common complications and managed differently.
