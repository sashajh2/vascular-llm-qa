iﬁcantly better stroke/death rates in the long-term
at 5 years. In symptomatic low surgical risk patients,
CEA was associated with lower risk of stroke, but a signiﬁcant increase in MI compared with CAS during the
ﬁrst 30 days. The long-term outcome of transfemoral CAS
vs CEA in symptomatic patients suggests that the risk of
death or stroke within 120 days of the index procedure
was higher for CAS
