 thrombosis.

Embolism
Embolic events occur when material, typically clot, dislodges from a source and travels in
the arterial system until it deposits in a vessel causing an obstruction. Emboli typically get
lodged at arterial bifurcation sites or in atherosclerotic vessels. For example in the lower
extremity, clot commonly lodges at the bifurcation where the common femoral artery divides
into the superficial femoral artery and profunda.
