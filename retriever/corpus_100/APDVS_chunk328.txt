 In severe cases,
atherosclerosis can lead to critical limb threatening ischemia (CLTI), a condition marked by
severe arterial blockages and tissue damage. CLTI can result in non-healing ulcers, gangrene,
and, in the absence of intervention, limb amputation. Atherosclerotic plaques are also prone
to rupture or ulceration, exposing their contents to the bloodstream. This can lead to the
formation of blood clots (thrombosis)
