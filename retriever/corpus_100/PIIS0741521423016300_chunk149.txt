 invasive foot procedure is being considered, peripheral artery disease should be excluded by performing
assessment of pedal Doppler waveforms in combination with
ankle brachial index and toe brachial index.

Best Practice Statement

Rationale. Except when required as an emergency to
control severe infection, all people with diabetes who
require foot surgery should have vascular testing consisting of pedal Doppler waveforms in combination with ABI
and toe pressure (TP) or TBI
