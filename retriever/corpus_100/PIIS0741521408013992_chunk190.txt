 with arm elevation. The physical
examination can be used to estimate access diameter, its
depth from the skin, the presence of collateral veins and the

investigation is warranted to identify potentially remediable
anatomic lesions. These may include a venous or arterial
stenosis, competing veins, large patent branches, or excessive depth from the skin
