ﬁrst approach. The open approach
has been associated with a higher perioperative complication rate, hospital length of stay, and cost, although the
perioperative mortality rates seem to be equivocal. These
increased perioperative complications are offset by a
lower rate of recurrent symptoms and reinterventions,
despite no difference in long-term mortality. Interestingly, Wagenhäuser et al161 reported that patients undergoing open revascularization had a lower health related
