 device initially requires the crossing of the lesion,
which can result in increased embolization. Also, this device has the disadvantage of stopping blood ﬂow during
stenting. However, it does have an advantage of smaller
diameter than proximal occlusion devices. If these devices used, it is crucial to aspirate adequately after stenting and before balloon deﬂation to remove all debris.
Vasospasm may be encountered before or just after ﬁlter
