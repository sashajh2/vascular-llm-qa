 rays due to its density. Dense materials
increase the likelihood of radiation interacting with subatomic particles, reducing the raysâ€™
passage through the material.
As gamma rays pass through the body, they cause ionizing damage to tissue and DNA and
should be treated with caution.

X-Rays
X-rays, widely used in healthcare, share similarities with gamma rays in their ability to penetrate tissue.
Their application in medical imaging includes plain X-ray films, CT scans, and fuoroscopy.
