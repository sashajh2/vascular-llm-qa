 combination with different materials. Unfortunately, the different
combinations of materials are often poorly described in
trials.
Coexistence of multiple devices that are designed to
perform essentially the same function demonstrates that
although compression therapy is generally effective, the
optimization of compression has been a challenging task

A total of nine RCTs compare compression therapy to
no compression therapy, and these trials provide objective
information on initial ulcer size as well as the outcomes
