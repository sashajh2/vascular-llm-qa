 quality of evidence for safety and
early efficacy was high, but evidence for long-term effectiveness in these randomized studies was of low quality.
Perioperative pain was higher in the EVLA groups in two
studies, but postoperative hematomas were less frequent.
As also stated by Thakur at al,276 meaningful comparison
across randomized studies of endovenous treatments is
difficult because of considerable variations in study populations and outcome measures between trials.
