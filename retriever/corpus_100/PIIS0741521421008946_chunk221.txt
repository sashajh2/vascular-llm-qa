section examines the impact of lesion morphology on
outcome following carotid revascularization techniques.

High risk for CEA. Lesion-speciﬁc morphology generally
does not have a signiﬁcant impact on CEA outcome. The
degree of lesion calciﬁcation, echolucency, and the presence of fresh thrombus have not been shown to impact
risk of neurologic events following CEA as these lesions
can be removed en bloc.
