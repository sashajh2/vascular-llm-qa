elective cases as this distinction was not explicitly made
in many of the published series. Similarly, data on other
patient important outcomes such as acute limb ischemia,
late conversion from endovascular to open repair, and
quality of life were insufÔ¨Åcient to estimate a treatment
effect. Randomized trials of treatments of PAAS are challenging. Future research efforts could focus on establishing rigorous multic
