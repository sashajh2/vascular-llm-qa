ography (MRA) can provide three-dimensional images that can rival those of formal arteriography.75 Its
main advantages include the absence of radiation and
the avoidance of iodinated-based contrast materials.
Additionally, MRA can be combined with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, delineating clinically silent
cerebral infarction. It can also evaluate plaque
morphology, in particular, the presence of intraplaque
hemorrhage.127 Contraindications
