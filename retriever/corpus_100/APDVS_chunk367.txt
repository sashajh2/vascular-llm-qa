50 = 0.97 and
using the PT systolic pressure the ABI = 150/150 = 1.0. So the Right ABI is 1.0, because we
choose the highest of the two ankle pressures for the final value of the ABI.
On the left lower extremity, using the DP systolic pressure the ABI is 120/150 = 0.8 and using
the PT systolic pressure the
