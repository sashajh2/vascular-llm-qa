liteal artery. After failure of an exercise program and optimization of medical therapy,
endovascular intervention can be considered. Open surgical bypass success is dependent on arterial inﬂow,
outﬂow, and the quality of the bypass conduit. Primary
predictors of endovascular success and long-term patency
differ signiﬁcantly and include the length of the lesion,
degree of stenosis, size of the artery, and degree of
calciﬁcation.
