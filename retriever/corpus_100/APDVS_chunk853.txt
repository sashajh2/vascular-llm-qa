etrance
A critical concept to understand when discussing occupational and patient exposure to radiation is penetrance.
 Penetrance refers to the ability of emitted radiation to penetrate into or through materials and is defined as the fraction of radiation passing through a given object (or the
inverse of attenuation).
 The density of materials or tissues determines their ability to attenuate or block
X-rays.
 Dense tissues (bone) or materials (lead) absorb a greater fraction of radiation while less
dense tissues (skin) or
