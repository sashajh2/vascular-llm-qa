promptly in patients with prior CEA.
5. Investigative studies for suspected prosthetic patch
infection should include duplex scanning and CTA,
as well as appropriate laboratory and infectious disease studies.
6. Presumptive antibiotics directed toward common
pathogens should be started in patients with suspected prosthetic patch infection.
7. In patients with a documented patch infection, operative management is indicated. Prosthetic material
must be excised, and arterial reconstruction performed using autologous material.
