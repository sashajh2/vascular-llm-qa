 for the
noninvasive evaluation of the venous system in patients with simple
varicose veins (CEAP class C2).
We recommend that venous plethysmography be used for the
noninvasive evaluation of the venous system in patients with
advanced chronic venous disease if duplex scanning does not
provide definitive information on pathophysiology (CEAP class
C3-C6).
