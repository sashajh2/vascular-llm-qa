 of the structures being imaged.
The duration of exposure: The dose of radiation delivered to the patient and the OR staff
is directly correlated with the duration of exposure. This is why vascular surgeons try to limit
the amount of time under fuoroscopy to the minimum required.
The distance from the source: The intensity of radiation exposure decreases with distance
from the emitting source in an inverse square relationship. The patient and surgeons at bedside
and closest to the C-arm, therefore, receive significantly
