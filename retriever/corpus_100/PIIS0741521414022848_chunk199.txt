 IC that is minimally symptomatic or well tolerated has no beneﬁt, may cause harm, and is never indicated.
It is also important to recognize that the degree of

physiologic testing and anatomic ﬁndings. It has been well
established that the resting ABI, for example, is a modest predictor of the degree of walking impairment by self-reported
symptoms or objective testing.123,1
