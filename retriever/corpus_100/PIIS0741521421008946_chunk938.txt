signals and these signals are higher for symptomatic patients.623,624 A linear relationship between the process of
mechanically unstable areas of carotid plaques and
cognitive decline suggests a contributory role of microembolization in silent strokes.613 Several studies showed
that embolic signals are associated with faster cognitive
deterioration and dementia in elderly despite an
absence of neuro
