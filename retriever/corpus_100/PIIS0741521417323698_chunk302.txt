The peak wall rupture index considers both peak wall
stress and residual wall strength and has been proposed
as more predictive than estimates of peak wall stress
alone.223-225 Further analyses have also incorporated the
inﬂuence of intraluminal hemodynamic conditions on
wall stress and strength indices through ﬂuid structure
interaction simulations.226,227 The value of CTdetermined intralum
