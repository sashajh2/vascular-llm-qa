4.1. For patients with superﬁcial truncal vein aneurysm, located within 3 cm of the SFJ or SPJ, open surgical excision, with high proximal and distal ligations
should be performed. If symptomatic saphenous reﬂux
is present, endovenous or open surgical ablation (phlebectomy or limited stripping) of the distal saphenous
vein should be performed.
