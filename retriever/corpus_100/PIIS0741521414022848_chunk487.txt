Bui et al265 analyzed a consecutive series of 94 interventions in 85 patients for SFA-popliteal artery occlusive disease.
Prophylactic interventions were rarely performed, and reinterventions were reserved almost exclusively for clinical indications such as recurrent symptoms or failure of wounds to
heal. Patients were stratiﬁed by whether the initial scan performed in the ﬁrst 30 days after the intervention was normal.
