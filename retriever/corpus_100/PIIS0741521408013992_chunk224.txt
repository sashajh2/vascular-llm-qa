 in reducing graft thrombosis or prolonging graft
longevity. These studies have used a variety of surveillance
methods, including static dialysis venous pressures, flow
monitoring, and DU imaging. In each of these studies, the
intervention group had a substantially higher rate of preemptive angioplasty. Despite that, access surveillance failed
to improve thrombosis-free graft survival or overall (cumulative) graft survival in five of the six studies.76,95
