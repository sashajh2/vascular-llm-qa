 stress on the vessel walls, enhancing collateral vessel growth. Furthermore, physical activity increases oxygen demand of the active tissues creating a
relative hypoxic environment, leading to collateralization/angiogenesis/arteriogenesis as
described above. This is why dedicated exercise is an important aspect of treatment for
claudication.
The development of collateral circulation in PAD is a gradual process that occurs over time
in response to the chronic reduction in blood fow. While collateralization can help improve
perfusion
