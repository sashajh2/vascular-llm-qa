ations to these contexts, clinicians should consider these as suggestions (GRADE 2). Similarly, newer
medical therapies (statins, more potent antiplatelet agents,
and improved management for diabetes and hypertension)
might favorably alter the outcome of medical management
sufficiently to diminish the strength of this recommendation. Newer therapies were included in ACST and their use
in that study did not result in a diminution of the benefit of
endarterectomy from that seen in ACAS.
