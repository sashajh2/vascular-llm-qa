 or both, has not been speciﬁcally evaluated for the treatment of IC and presents
additional problems and the risk of signiﬁcant complications. Popliteal occlusive disease may result in IC, especially
when there are poorly developed collaterals from the profunda femoral artery through the geniculate arteries. EVT
of popliteal artery occlusive disease is technically feasible;
however, its long-term durability is not known, and failure
in this location may result in
