, 1.05-2.60; P ¼ .03) undergoing transfemoral CAS vs CEA.
High risk for TCAR.
Hostile nonvascular anatomy. Although similar to
CEA, several anatomic considerations that may increase
the difﬁculty of CEA may not be as prohibitive for
TCAR. For example, if the proximal CCA is not exposed
during the primary CEA, there may be no increased risk
