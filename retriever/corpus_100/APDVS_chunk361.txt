is obliterated, and then the cuff is then slowly released; the pressure at which the Doppler
signal returns is the ankle pressure. The same process is repeated for both legs (DP and PT
signals) and both arms. The arm pressure must be conducted with the manual blood pressure
cuff that is placed above the target vessel and the Doppler probe that is placed below the cuff
to evaluate blood fow. To calculate the ABI, the higher ankle pressure (DP or PT)
