Data on infrainguinal deep vein obstruction and interventions on superﬁcial veins are sparse because many
vascular specialists avoid superﬁcial truncal ablation in
patients with extensive post-thrombotic deep vein
obstruction. There is a very low level of evidence that
saphenous ablation can be performed in patients with
femoropopliteal venous occlusion.77 It is important to
remember that, in severely symptomatic patients with
