 associated with a higher risk of acute or late stent
occlusion. Heavy circumferential calcification makes lesion
dilation more difficult and also increases the risk of embolization with CAS. There are no lesion specific characteristics that increase the risk of CEA.
c. Other anatomic considerations. Several anatomic
situations may increase the difficulty of CEA. These
include reoperation after prior CEA, existence of a cervical stoma, history of neck radiotherapy with resultant
