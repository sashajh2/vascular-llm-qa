Intervention can be performed by open direct repair
with possible sternotomy (mini), cervical extra-anatomic
bypass or transposition, hybrid open/endovascular, or
endovascular intervention alone. Endarterectomy and
bypass procedures with sternotomy or trap-door incisions may be considered with equally excellent longterm patency, although small series suggest direct
reconstruction with endarterectomy may be superior to
bypass.516,51
