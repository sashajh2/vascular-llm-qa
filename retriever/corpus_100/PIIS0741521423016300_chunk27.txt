Recommendation

9. In a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene, it is
suggested that the presence of peripheral artery disease and
other causes of poor healing should always be assessed. Diabetes
related micro-angiopathy should not be considered the primary
cause of foot ulceration, gangrene, or poor wound healing
without excluding other causes.
