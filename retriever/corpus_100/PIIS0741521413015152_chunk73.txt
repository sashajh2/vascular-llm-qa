 for a more
comprehensive system. The concept of a single dichotomous hemodynamic cutoff point for CLI no longer applies
to the majority of patients encountered in current clinical
practice; various degrees of ischemia may prove “critical”
depending on the overall status of the limb. It has become
clear that limb ischemia does not have sharp cutoff points
but consists of a gradual spectrum in the pattern of
a sigmoidal curve (Fig). Wound healing, thus, depends
