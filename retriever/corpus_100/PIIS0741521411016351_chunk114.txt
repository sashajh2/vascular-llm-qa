 more moderate (50% to
69%) from severe stenosis. Similarly, high-grade stenosis
will result in a loss of signal on MRA. This does not
represent a carotid occlusion when the more distal cervical
carotid is visualized. However, when there is no reconstitution of the cervical carotid artery on MRA, the diagnosis
of carotid occlusion can be made with a high degree of
certainty
