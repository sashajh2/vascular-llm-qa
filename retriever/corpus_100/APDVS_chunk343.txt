 vessels
as a compensatory mechanism to improve perfusion to tissues affected by reduced blood fow.
These new blood vessels, or collaterals, bypass or supplement the obstructed arteries and
combat oxygen starvation of the tissues through “collateral circulation.” The main drivers for
the development of collateral vessels in PAD are as follows:
 Ischemia and Hypoxia: In PAD, atherosclerosis narrows and sometimes occludes
the arteries that supply blood to the limbs. The resulting reduced
