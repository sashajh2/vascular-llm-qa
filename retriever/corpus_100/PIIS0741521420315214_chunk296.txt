 ischemia after CA coverage and
the need for CA revascularization through open (traditional open surgical management) or endovascular interventions (such as parallel [“snorkel”] stents or
fenestrations, given appropriate investigational device
exemption and local experience). However, CTA does
not demonstrate dynamic ﬂow and has been proved to
be incorrect as a single imaging modality in predicting
safe coverage of the CA after TEVAR by some
authors
