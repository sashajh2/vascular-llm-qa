with asymptomatic PAD who use tobacco (repeatedly until tobacco use has stopped).
We recommend providing education about the signs and symptoms of PAD progression to
asymptomatic patients with PAD.
We recommend against invasive treatments for PAD in the absence of symptoms, regardless of
hemodynamic measures or imaging Ô¨Åndings demonstrating PAD.
