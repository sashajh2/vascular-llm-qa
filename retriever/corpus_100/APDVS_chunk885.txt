 further away from the area being imaged.
If the X-ray tube is too close, imaging quality can degrade and radiation dose increases. This
strategic arrangement ensures that the image quality remains high while minimizing patient
exposure to radiation.

Another crucial aspect of radiation exposure is a person’s distance from the radiation
source. Radiation exposure decreases as the distance from the source increases. This phenomenon follows an inverse square law (1/d
