to have equivalent outcomes to midterm therapy.98
Therefore, application of compression for 1 week after
any endothermal treatment, especially those with concurrent phlebectomy may be useful for pain reduction.
In the recently published multicenter society guidelines, a compression dressing of >20 mm Hg (corresponding with class II compression stocking pressure)
with eccentric pads over the ablation point is recommended for patients undergoing vein ablation for
greatest reduction in postoperative pain.
