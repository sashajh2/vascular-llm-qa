located at or near the origin of an aberrant subclavian artery (ASA).44 Aberrant right and left subclavian arteries (in
a right-sided aortic arch) are typically associated with a

the LSA and crosses through the posterior mediastinum
behind the esophagus on its way to the right upper extremity. The aberrant vessel has the potential to cause a
