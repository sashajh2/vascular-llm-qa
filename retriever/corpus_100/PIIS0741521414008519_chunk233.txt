7), platelet-derived growth factor AA, and
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.71-82 Importantly, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in
venous ulcer Ô¨Åbroblast have been demonstrated to overexpress P38, a negative modulator of cell proliferation
causing growth arrest, which can also be upregulated
with the cytokines TNF-a and interleukin-1. The expression of P38 can be suppressed, leading to
