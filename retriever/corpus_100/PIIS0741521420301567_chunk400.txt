 MRA sequences can
be more time-consuming than contrast-enhanced
MRA, non-contrast-enhanced MRA has almost the
same sensitivity for detecting vascular abnormalities
and a high negative predictive value. Non-contrastenhanced MRA (like contrast-enhanced MRA) can be superior and complementary to ultrasound in evaluating
most parts of the body because it is not limited by acoustic windows, particularly in the thoracoabdominal vasculature.202-204
