 FPOD, with
a higher proportion of acute limb ischemia events
compared with BMS, particularly when distal collateral vessels are covered.214 Covered stents may have a role in the
treatment of diffuse in-stent restenosis in the SFA.215 At
the present time, given the increased cost and lack of clinical superiority over BMSs, a primary role for covered stents
in the treatment of IC due to FPOD
