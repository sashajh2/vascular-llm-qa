 hemodynamically signiﬁcant
arterial insufﬁciency.38 Although not necessary in all patients, further noninvasive testing with segmental pressures
and pulse volume recordings can be helpful in objectively
quantifying the magnitude of the deﬁcit in perfusion and
aiding in localizing the level of arterial obstruction.
In the setting of compelling symptoms and normal
results on noninvasive vascular testing at rest, obtaining
an ABI with exercise can be helpful. A
