 grade stenosis defined as >70-80%. Since
the modality is based primarily on velocity range, it cannot give exact stenosis such as 66%.
The modality can also provide adjunct information about the blood fow waveforms in each
arterial segment, as well as whether that fow is laminar or turbulent with utilization of color
fow imaging. Limitations of this imaging include technician skill, inability to obtain optimal
angle of Doppler
