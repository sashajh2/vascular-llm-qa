 in
those that may be difficult to cross due to tortuosity or
severe narrowing because protection is in place before the
lesion is manipulated. Use of a filter over proximal or distal
occlusion is preferred if there is a likelihood that interruption of antegrade ICA flow will not be tolerated. Distal
occlusion devices are preferred to filters when the distal
ICA anatomy suggests that compete apposition of filter to
the distal ICA wall may be
