 this correlates better with tissue perfusion pressure, and any sustained external compression pressure should never exceed this cutoff perfusion pressure.
One study showed that modiﬁed compression multilayered
bandages with reduced compression pressure can be beneﬁcial for healing of mixed ulcers.311

Guideline 5.5: Intermittent Pneumatic Compression
We suggest use of intermittent pneumatic compression when other compression options are not available,
cannot be used, or have failed to
