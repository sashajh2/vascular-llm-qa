 was insufﬁcient to recommend an optimal frequency of surveillance. Magnetic
resonance imaging was more sensitive than CT angiography and contrast-enhanced CT, although the difference
was small. Duplex ultrasound was inferior to CT and
contrast-enhanced ultrasound in terms of detection rate,
although leaks missed on ultrasound did not require intervention or were not considered to be clinically signiﬁcant.

The goal of postoperative surveillance is to prevent late
rupture and aneurysm-related death.
