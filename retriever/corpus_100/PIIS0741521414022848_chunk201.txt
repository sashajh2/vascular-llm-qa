 IC is not based primarily on physiologic (eg, ABI) measures or on anatomic ﬁndings but rather
on the severity of functional impairment speciﬁc to arterial
insufﬁciency and its perceived effect on QoL, supported by
objective evidence of signiﬁcant disease. Promoting intervention in an individual with mild disability based on physiologic
or imaging studies is strongly discouraged.
Determining the degree of functional impairment from IC
is not straightforward
