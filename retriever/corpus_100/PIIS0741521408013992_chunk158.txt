suture to prevent future increase of the anastomotic
surface area. These two maneuvers limit future increases
in flow through the autogenous access and decrease the
incidence of arterial steal. Although the role of exercise
to encourage early maturation of the autogenous access
is not supported by strong evidence, some access surgeons continue to ask patients to perform hand exercises
starting 24 to 48 hours postoperatively to increase blood
flow through the vein to
