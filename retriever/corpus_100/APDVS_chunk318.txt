 The peroneal artery, also known as the fibular artery, is the third
major branch of the popliteal artery. As mentioned, it originated from tibioperoneal
trunk along with the PT. The peroneal artery runs along the lateral side of the leg and
supplies the lateral compartment muscles. In the ankle region, it anastomoses with the
branches of the posterior tibial artery, providing collateral circulation.
