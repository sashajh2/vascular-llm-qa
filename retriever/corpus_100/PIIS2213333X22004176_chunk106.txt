untreated without a DU evaluation. Dhillon et al46 recently
compared HHD ultrasound with point-of-care portable
color Doppler ultrasound in assessing venous reﬂux.
Although portable color Doppler ultrasound had had
marginally greater sensitivity than HHD ultrasound and a
better negative predictive value above the knee, both
tests had had an w30% negative predictive value, which is
inadequate for the exclusion of signiﬁcant reﬂux
