Key points:
 Rupture can be cause by an oversized balloon or balloon expandable stent, by expanding
a properly sized balloon in a heavily calcified vessel or by passage of a large device such
as an EVAR device through a small vessel.
 Rupture is associated with a high morbidity and mortality especially if there is any delay
in diagnosis.
 Immediately upon recognition of vessel rupture, a balloon should be infated in the
region to obtain adequate hemostasis. Simult
