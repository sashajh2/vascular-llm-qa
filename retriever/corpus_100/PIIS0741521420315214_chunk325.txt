 have shown that the sizes of the common and
external iliac arteries remain a barrier to device delivery in
some patients. Atherosclerotic occlusive disease can be
treated with balloon angioplasty or use of the Dotter
technique with serially larger balloons and dilators to
facilitate transfemoral delivery of a device, but it should
be performed carefully with low-pressure inï¬‚ations
starting with a small balloon to avoid iliac rupture.
