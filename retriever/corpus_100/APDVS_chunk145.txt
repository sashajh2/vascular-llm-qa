 used to evaluate carotid artery stenosis with the lowest
cost option being color fow duplex ultrasound (DSA) that allows a physician to determine
peak systolic and end diastolic velocities throughout the carotid bifurcation. Based on the
internally validated vascular laboratory criteria of the institution, these velocities can be correlated to ranges of degree of stenosis, with high grade stenosis defined as >70-80%. Since
the modality is based
