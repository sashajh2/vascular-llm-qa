 are generated, and the detector.
 The shape of the beam from the source is managed by the collimator.
 As X-ray beam passes through the patient, they are captured by the detector and an

In endovascular procedures using a C-arm, the detector portion (i.e. image intensifier) is above
the patient, while the X-ray source is beneath the patient and table.
