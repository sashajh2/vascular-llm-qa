(21% to 5%) and a signiÔ¨Åcant reduction of recurrent events
before CEA (13% to 3%). In the absence of high-quality evidence, it may seem reasonable to offer heparin plus
aspirin or dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with a
recurrent TIAs or crescendo TIAs before urgent CEA.
Urgent CEA in these patients has been associated with
an increased risk of stroke compared with elective interventions.
