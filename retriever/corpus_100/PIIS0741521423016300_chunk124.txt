When calculating the ABI in the leg of a person with and
without DFU for the purposes of diagnosing PAD, it is
advised to use the lower systolic blood pressure of either
the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery as this improves
the diagnostic accuracy of the test.5 For PAD affecting arteries below the knee, this calculation method identiﬁes
the most severe disease while using the higher pressure
identiﬁes the least affected artery.
