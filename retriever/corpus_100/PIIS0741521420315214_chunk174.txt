Multiplanar reconstructions allow the aorta to be simultaneously visualized in coronal, sagittal, and axial planes.
This allows a more nuanced understanding of the location
of branches and aortic curvature and a precise identiÔ¨Åcation of seal zones. Centerline reconstructions are used to
determine exact distances between branch arteries, and
the length of the thoracic aorta can be measured as well.
The diameter of the aorta can be precisely determined
with centerline measurements
