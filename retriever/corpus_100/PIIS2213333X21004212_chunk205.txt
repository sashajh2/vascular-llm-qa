atomic
closure rates were higher after HL/S vs RFA. Compared
with RFA, HL/S was signiﬁcantly associated with an
increased risk of minor AEs. At 1 year, those who
underwent UGFS had a higher risk of reintervention
than HL/S and had a higher risk of recurrent reﬂux. At
5 years, anatomic closure was the lowest among patients
who had UGFS. There was no difference in clinical
