measures of inflow adequacy and may be helpful in selected
cases. Calculating the resistance index or simple ultrasound
observation of changes in the arterial waveform during a
clinched fist maneuver (reactive hyperemia) predicts the
vesselâ€™s ability to accommodate the anticipated marked
increase in flow required for a successful AV access.54,59
