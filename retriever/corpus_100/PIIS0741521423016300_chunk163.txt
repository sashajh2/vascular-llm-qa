 of the pedal arterial Doppler waveforms
combined with measurement of the AP and subsequent
calculation of the ABI, are usually the ﬁrst steps in the
assessment of PAD. Although relevant for its diagnosis,
as discussed in the Rationales of Recommendations 1
and 2, it was not possible to identify sufﬁcient data on
the capacity for Doppler arterial waveform analysis to
predict wound healing in populations with DFU.5 Two
low quality studies were identi
