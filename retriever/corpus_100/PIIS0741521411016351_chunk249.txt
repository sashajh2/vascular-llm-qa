 plaque increases the risk of embolization during
placement of the wire or stent across the carotid lesion. This
can be reduced, but not eliminated, by using flow-reversal
embolic protection rather than distal filter protection.185
Long segment lesions may require the placement of multiple stents, and this situation and preocclusive stenoses are
both associated with a higher risk of acute or late stent
occlusion. Heavy circumferential calc
