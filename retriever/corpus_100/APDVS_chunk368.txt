20/150 = 0.8 and using
the PT systolic pressure the ABI = 110/150 = 0.73. So the Left ABI is 0.8, because we choose
the highest of the two ankle pressures for the final value of the ABI.
For this above example, R ABI = 1.0 and L ABI = 0.8. So this patient may have some
peripheral vascular disease present in
