 years, and ⬎3 years is
important to define periprocedural, early, midterm, and
late failures. Timing of the study is important because
saphenous patency after ablation on a periprocedural duplex image (⬍3 days) indicates technical failure, whereas
late patency after early occlusion suggests recanalization.
The type of recurrence on late duplex scanning should also
be documented, because recanalization of a previously
occluded
