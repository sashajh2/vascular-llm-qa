ortic diameters are relatively smaller in the younger subset
of trauma patients. Currently, available thoracic endograft
sizes mostly reflect the larger aortic diameters that would be
typically encountered in an older cohort with degenerative
aneurysms. Excessive oversizing may result in attachment
site endoleak, device infolding, endograft collapse, and
even death from acute aortic occlusion.16 Endograft collapse represents a failure of the therapy and a
