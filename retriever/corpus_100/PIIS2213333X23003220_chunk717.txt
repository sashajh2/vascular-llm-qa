 power in the setting
of this low event rate. Assuming a pooled incidence of
all venous thromboembolic (VTE) events of 1.5%, a randomized clinical trial evaluating the ability of screening
DUS to reduce the incidence to 1% would require
approximately 15,500 patients.238 Furthermore, routine
ultrasound screening is not recommended even in populations at higher risk for VTE, including critically ill patients with coronavirus 20
