sequence or time-spatial labeling inversion pulse technique. Studies evaluating steady-state free precession sequences have shown excellent concordance as well as
interobserver agreement with contrast-enhanced
MRA.18,19 Furthermore, time-spatial labeling inversion
pulse non-contrast-enhanced MRA has also shown
promise compared with contrast-enhanced CTA with
74% sensitivity, 93% speciÔ¨Åcity, and 90% accuracy.20
