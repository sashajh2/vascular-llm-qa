 lateral projection is optimal to view the origins of the CA and SMA
given their posterior-anterior orientation. Selective cannulation can provide additional visualization of the

and any collateral channels. Intraluminal pressure measurements can be made across a stenosis at the time
of arteriography if there is a question regarding the hemodynamic signiÔ¨Åcance of the lesion.77 It is worth
