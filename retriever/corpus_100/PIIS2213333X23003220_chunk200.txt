2.1. Compression therapy vs intervention.
2.1.1. For patients with symptomatic varicose veins
and axial reﬂux in the superﬁcial truncal veins, we suggest compression therapy for primary treatment if the
patient’s ambulatory status or underlying medical conditions warrant a conservative approach or, if the patient prefers conservative treatment, for either a trial
period or deﬁnitive management.
