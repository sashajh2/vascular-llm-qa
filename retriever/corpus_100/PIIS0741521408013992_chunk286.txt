. A longitudinal
incision is made in the prosthetic graft and extended to
the vein through the lesion. A Fogarty catheter is used
to perform thrombectomy from the longitudinal incision. When the thrombectomy is complete, as evidenced by excellent arterial inflow, the longitudinal
incision is closed using a patch that widens the lumen at
the venous anastomotic site. The incorporated main
body of the access can then be used for dialysis
