 posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries of each leg, which is then normalized to
the higher brachial pressure of either to calculate the ABI for
each leg. ABI is calculated by dividing the systolic ankle pressure by systolic arm pressure. The reproducibility of the ABI
varies, but it is signiﬁcant enough that reporting standards
require a change of 0.15 in an isolated measurement for it
to be considered clinically relevant or >0
