 in aortic branches can mark the location
of target branches and minimize the need for repeated
contrast angiography. A marker catheter may be
inserted through a small-diameter left brachial artery
sheath, for example, to mark the location of the LSA, or
a wire or catheter placed in the CA to mark its location
regardless of aortic or thoracic motion. This strategy
can also allow bailout techniques in case of branch
coverage.
