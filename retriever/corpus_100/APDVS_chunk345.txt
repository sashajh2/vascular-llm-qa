 Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs): When cells are deprived of oxygen (as in the case
of PAD), they activate hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). HIFs are transcription factors
such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF).
These factors promote the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis (the formation
of new blood vessels) and arteriogenesis (the remodeling and
