 et al47 studied healthy volunteers comparing
bandaging using a large ﬂat compression pad vs a small
narrow pad. Different surgeons achieved different
degrees of compression. The use of a foam pad over
the injection site was successful as long as ﬁbrinous
occlusion in the vein took place. This study suggested
the need to measure pressures under the bandaging.
Some studies have questioned the need for compression after sclerotherapy. The effectiveness of compression bandaging or
