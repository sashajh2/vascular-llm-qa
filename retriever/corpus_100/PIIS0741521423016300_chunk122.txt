 diagnose
and exclude PAD (PLR 2.0 e 3.55, NLR 0.25 e 0.44), and
the presence of a visual monophasic pedal Doppler
waveform (compared with a biphasic or triphasic
Doppler waveform where the waveform crosses the
zero ï¬‚ow baseline and contains both forward and reverse
velocity components)53 has a moderate ability to diagnose and exclude PAD
