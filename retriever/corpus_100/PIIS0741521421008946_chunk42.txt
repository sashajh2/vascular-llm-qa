 clearly increases the risk
of MI and cardiovascular death.32 However, in
population-based studies, the prevalence of severe stenosis is not high enough to make a bruit alone an indication
for screening. Thus, screening for a bruit alone should not
be done unless patients have other stenosis risk factors.3
It is reasonable to image the carotid bifurcation in patients with evidence of cerebral infarction on brain imaging, even without a relevant clinical history
