 accurate in identifying calcification but less reliable
in describing carotid plaque morphology, specifically the
lipid component, or ulceration. CTA appears less reliable
than DUS imaging or MRA for assessing plaque morphology.82 Other limitations of this technique include cost
(compared with DUS), contrast exposure, and the added
concern of radiation exposure. In addition, a large calcium
burden can limit the ability to distinguish contrast from
calcium during postprocessing imaging.
