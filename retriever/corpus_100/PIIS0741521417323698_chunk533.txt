 volume and prior dedicated vascular
training also affect mortality of OSR. Dimick and associates reported that elective AAA mortality was lowest
when operations were performed by vascular surgeons
(2.2%) compared with cardiac surgeons (4%) and general
surgeons (5.5%; P < .001).442 Using a risk-adjusted analysis, high hospital volume, vascular surgery specialty,
and high surgeon volume were independent predictors
for lower risk of in-hospital mortality after elective
