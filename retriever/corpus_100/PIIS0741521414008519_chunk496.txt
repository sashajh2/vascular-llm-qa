 grade of evidence is 1B.
Regarding the choice of method of saphenous ablation, there are multiple RCTs showing strong and consistent evidence that modern open surgery, radiofrequency,
and laser ablation are equivalent in effect and safety
(Table IX).319-330 Endovenous ablation can be extrapolated to be as effective as open ligation and stripping
used in these earlier trials. Moreover, endovenous ablation
can be carried out under
