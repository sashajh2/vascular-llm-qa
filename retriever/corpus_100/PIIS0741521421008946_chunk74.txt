indexed minimal residual lumen to the diameter of the
carotid bulb (as opposed to the normal distal cervical
ICA). Both methods may have inherent inaccuracies.51
The ECST technique must use arteriographic images to
estimate the actual location of the carotid bulb wall
and the NASCET technique may calculate a negative
value for stenosis when minimal occlusive disease is present at the carotid bifurcation. Currently, the NASCET
