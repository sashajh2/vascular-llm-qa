 not only by the degree of ischaemia. Other
factors such as infection, extent of tissue loss, and ulcer
depth, can have a major effect on healing potential
and amputation risk, as discussed below. For this reason
and the uncertainty of the evidence, a Conditional
Recommendation for use of AP, ABI, and TP to predict
the likelihood of healing and amputation was made.
TcPO2 and SPP tests require more expensive equipment and greater expertise for
