 imaging. Limitations of this imaging include technician skill, inability to obtain optimal
angle of Doppler interrogation for velocity determination, shadowing from heavily calcified
lesions, poor visualization due to patient habitus and tortuosity.
Axial imaging options include both computed tomography angiogram (CTA) and magnetic
resonance angiogram (MRA). Both of these options require some form of intra-arterial contrast,
either iodinated contrast or gadolinium, respectively. However
