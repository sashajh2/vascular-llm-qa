 in long-term access patency if the stenosis is
not addressed.
2. Late thrombosis. Although both autogenous and
prosthetic accesses are prone to late thrombosis, the approach to late thrombosis differs substantially. Prosthetic
accesses have a much higher incidence of thrombosis and
the access-specific stenotic lesion is more predictably found
in a specific location, at the prosthetic venous anastomosis.
In contrast,
