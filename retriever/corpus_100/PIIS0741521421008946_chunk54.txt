astolic velocities. Ultrasound criteria describing the degree of carotid stenosis should be deÔ¨Åned on angiographic/imaging correlation in each vascular laboratory.
The most common consensus criteria include a cutoff
peak systolic velocity of the ICA of 125 cm/second or
greater to denote an angiographic stenosis of greater

than 50%. A combination of peak systolic velocity of
230 cm/second and an end-diastolic velocity of
