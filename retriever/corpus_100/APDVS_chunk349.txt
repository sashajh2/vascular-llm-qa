 Shear Stress: As blood fows through collateral vessels, it exerts shear stress on the
vessel walls. Shear stress is a mechanical force that can trigger the release of molecules
like nitric oxide, which further stimulates vessel growth and remodeling.
 Physical Activity: Exercise and physical activity can also stimulate collateralization
by increasing shear stress on the vessel walls, enhancing collateral vessel growth. Furthermore, physical activity increases oxygen demand of the
