signal can be triphasic, biphasic, or monophasic.
 Triphasic and biphasic doppler signals indicate good blood fow.
 Monophasic signals correlate with a moderate to severe decrease in arterial blood fow.
 In severe ischemia, a soft continuous venous signal may be all that is heard.
 Temperature changes may help demarcate the level of disease.
 Sensory loss may be present in acute ischemia and chronic neuropathy.
