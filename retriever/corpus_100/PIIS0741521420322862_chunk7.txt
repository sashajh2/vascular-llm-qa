 a balloon-expandable covered intraluminal stent is the recommended initial treatment with open repair reserved for select younger patients and those who are

asymptomatic patients with severe mesenteric occlusive disease. Patient with recurrent symptoms after revascularization
owing to recurrent stenoses should be treated with an endovascular-Ô¨Årst approach, similar to the de novo lesion.
