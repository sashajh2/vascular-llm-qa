care unit.71 A variety of mechanical devices have been
designed to work in conjunction with thrombolytic agents
in an effort to improve the efficiency of thrombolysis,
reduce lytic doses and procedure times, and lessen bleeding
complications. These approaches, which include rotational,
rheolytic, and ultrasound-assisted devices, are collectively
referred to as pharmacomechanical thrombolysis.17,74 Limited data suggest that these devices should be
