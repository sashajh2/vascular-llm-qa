 down and to the right (increasing severity of
each of the individual WIfI score components). Lesser grades
of ischemia (below that which corresponds to the current
deÔ¨Ånition of CLI) were uniformly believed to contribute

and degree of infection increased. Inter-rater reliability was
assessed by the intraclass correlation (ICC) using a twoway random effects model evaluating absolute agreement.71

The ICC was
