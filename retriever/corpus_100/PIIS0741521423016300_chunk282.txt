 the foot and avoiding amputation.
Incomplete revascularisation (including treating inﬂow
disease when distal disease is present or bypassing into
blind segment arteries with no runoff), can result in
delayed or non-wound healing and a substantial risk of
amputation.
Bypass surgery is ideally performed to an outﬂow vessel
that runs into the foot. However, bypasses performed to
the peroneal artery (which rely on collateralisation to
the foot)
