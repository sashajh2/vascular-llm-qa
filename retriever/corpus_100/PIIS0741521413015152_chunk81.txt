and wounds complicated by infection, correction of intermediate perfusion deﬁcits (0.4 <ABI <0.8) may speed
healing of smaller wounds, or even be required to heal
extensive wounds. Patients in this intermediate perfusion
range were classiﬁed as ischemia grades 1 and 2. If the
ABI is unreliable or incompressible, TP or TcPO2 measurements must be performed to stratify the degree of ischemia.
The
