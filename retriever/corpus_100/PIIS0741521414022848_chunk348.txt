 with the associated
risk of abrupt closure. The adjunct use of a selfexpanding covered or BMS has been shown to be effective
in improving patency of longer lesions in the SFA and to
treat PTA-related complications of dissection and acute
recoil. Several trials have demonstrated the efÔ¨Åcacy and
possible superiority of self-expanding stents in the treatment of longer SFA lesions. In the Randomized Study
