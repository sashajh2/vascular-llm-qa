SURVEILLANCE AFTER TEVAR
Surveillance after TEVAR is critical to identify endoleaks
after initial placement and to evaluate whether longterm complications appear, such as migration, aneurysm
expansion despite no evidence of endoleak (type V endoleak, so-called endotension), new endoleaks, device failure (fracture, migration, component separation),
stenosis, or occlusion.
