 pressure from large abdominal girth.
This pressure increase will overwhelm an elastic product
and result in recurrent edema, with a high risk for recurrent ulceration. Aids for donning and dofﬁng stockings
are often awkward, and the techniques required can
be difﬁcult to master.
Velcro compression devices are an alternative to elastic
stockings because their inelastic nature produces higher
compression during ambulation, which in turn reduces
venous stasis and edema. The adjustable
