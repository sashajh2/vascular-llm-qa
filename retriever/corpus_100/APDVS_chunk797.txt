Risks
As with any invasive procedure, even a minimally invasive procedure comes with its own set
of risks, and as the complexity of the procedure increases so does the risk.
The American Heart Association has put out guidelines to help stratify patients at risk for
vascular complications.(Patel et al. 2010a)
Low risk cases were defined as those with a complication rate below 1%. Characteristics
include:


Diagnostic angiograms without interventions.
Short operative times
