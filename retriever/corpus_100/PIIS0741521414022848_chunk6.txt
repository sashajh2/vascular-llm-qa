ﬁt at present. Revascularization for IC is an appropriate therapy for selected patients with disabling symptoms,
after a careful risk-beneﬁt analysis. Treatment should be individualized based on comorbid conditions, degree of functional
impairment, and anatomic factors. Invasive treatments for IC should provide predictable functional improvements with
reasonable durability. A minimum threshold of a >50% likelihood of sustained efﬁcacy for at least 2 years is suggested as a
benchmark.
