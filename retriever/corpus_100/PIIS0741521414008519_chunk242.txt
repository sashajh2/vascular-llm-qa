 I/III ratio might
contribute to the weakness and the decreased elasticity
of varicose veins. Interestingly, the transcription of
collagen III is normal in smooth muscle cells from varicose veins and the activity of MMP-3 is increased, leading
to post-translational modiÔ¨Åcation of collagen type III;
these events are reversible when MMP-3 is inhibited
in vitro.87 MMPs are an important step in the development of primary venous disease; their
