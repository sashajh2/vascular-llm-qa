 probe is used to assess the blood fow. The
doppler signal can be triphasic, or biphasic, or monophasic.
Doppler Signals:
 Triphasic and biphasic doppler signals indicate good blood fow.

 Monophasic signal correlates with moderate to severe decrease in arterial blood
fow.
 In severe ischemia, a soft continuous venous signal may be all that is heard.
