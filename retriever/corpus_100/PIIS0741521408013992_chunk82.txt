 (DU) imaging, performed simultaneously with vein mapping, will aid in identifying
stenotic segments and determine arterial diameter in addition to calculation of arterial flow.54,55 The minimal arterial
lumen diameter is important. Studies have shown both 1.5
mm and 2.0 mm to be the minimally acceptable internal
arterial diameters for successful autogenous AV access,
although 2.0 mm seems to be the more commonly accepted limit in adults.56
