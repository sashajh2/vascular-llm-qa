timing. Certainty in estimates for key outcomes was
evaluated using the GRADE approach20-22 (Table II).
Statistical analysis. The relative risk (RR) was extracted
or calculated for binary outcomes. We calculated standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous results
when studies used different measures for the same effect (eg, pain scale). When studies used the same
outcome measure, we used the original scale and
expressed results as a
