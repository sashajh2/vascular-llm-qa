6 weeks after sclerotherapy. However, pressures under
these bandages were measured during 8 hours, and
the results showed that different surgeons applied
bandages over a wide range of pressures. The initial
pressures were also higher when standard compression
pads were used, although the rate at which the pressure
fell was about the same.
The question of short-term vs long-term standard
bandaging after sclerotherapy was also addressed in
the Cochrane review.
