require prompt urgent exploration.
Strategies for revisions can range from a simple thrombectomy to creation of completely new proximal anastomoses on the donor artery or vein. Occasionally, a preexisting venous stenosis that was not recognized before
placement of the access can be diagnosed angiographically.
In this situation, thrombectomy alone would not be expected to result in long-term access patency if the stenosis is
not addressed.
