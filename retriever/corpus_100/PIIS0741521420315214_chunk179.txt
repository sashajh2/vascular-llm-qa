 per kilogram of body weight. Images are acquired with a T1-weighted three-dimensional
spoiled gradient-recalled echo sequence, usually during
breath-hold. As with CTA, the relationship between
contrast material administration and image acquisition is
crucial. The source images can be reformatted in multiple
planes with maximum intensity projections and volume
rendering, and a three-dimensional centerline reconstruction can be generated using the MRA data set.68,69
