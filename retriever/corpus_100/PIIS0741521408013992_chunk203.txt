 is less reliable.
The most common methods of measuring access flow can
be performed in 10 to 15 minutes while the patient is on

measuring the rate of change in ultrasound transmission in
the venous line after infusion of a saline bolus through the
arterial line. The KDOQI Guidelines recommend monthly
measurement of access flow
