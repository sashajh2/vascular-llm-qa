, rendering them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. Hypertension
also increases the risk of thrombosis and clot formation, further compromising arterial
perfusion.
 Hyperlipidemia: High levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are a known
risk factor for PAD. Elevated LDL cholesterol leads to the accumulation of lipid deposits
in arterial walls, initiating the atherosclerotic process. Dyslipidemia management, particularly the reduction of LDL cholesterol, is essential in
