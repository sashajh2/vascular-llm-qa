 most experienced clinicians have a higher treatment threshold for IC in these
settings. In bilateral disease, treating physicians should
consider the probability of overall efÔ¨Åcacy as the product of
expected outcomes in each limb, because functional gains
are unlikely if success is achieved and maintained in one
limb only. Similarly, as new data are published demonstrating
the expected patency outcomes of evolving technologies in
various anatomic and clinical settings, this suggested benchmark should be carefully considered before applying such
