 obstruction and those related
to an underlying procoagulant–anticoagulant imbalance. The
development of limb-threatening venous ischemia may thus
be multifactorial, related to elevated venous pressures as well
as profound procoagulant–anticoagulant imbalances. Regardless of the mechanism, venous gangrene is associated with
death in one-third or more of patients and high rates of
amputation.52,54,57,59
