 For
repair of an infrarenal aortic aneurysm, the clamp is
placed immediately below the level of the lowest renal
artery; the graft is anastomosed to a rim of normal aortic
wall below the level of the clamp. Performing the proximal anastomosis within healthy aorta is important to
minimize the risk of aneurysmal degeneration at or
above the graft.
The transperitoneal approach is typically performed using a
