One week after surgery, patients in the higher compression group had lower edema scores, reduced feeling of
tightness, and greater reduction in discomfort. At
6 weeks, there was no difference in these outcomes
between the two groups. There were no differences in
rates of complications at either 1 week or 6 weeks postoperatively. The authors concluded that there was an
advantage for moderate compression after vein ablation
surgery, and they recommended compression under
such circumstances.
