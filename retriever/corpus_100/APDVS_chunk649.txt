the GSV close to the femoral vein without impinging on and thus narrowing the femoral vein.
Care must also be taken to not leave a long stump proximally because this increases the risk
of venous thromboembolism.
Recurrence rates are reduced when GSV stripping is performed in addition to high ligation
(HL&S) versus high ligation alone (Sidawy and Perler 2023e). After the GSV is lig
