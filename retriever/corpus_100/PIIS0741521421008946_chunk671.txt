. If the embolic material is large
enough to cause MCA occlusion, catheter-based thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA),
GPIIB/IIIA inhibitor, and thrombectomy with stent retrieval
should be considered. There is strong evidence that recanalizing the MCA with mechanical thrombectomy dramatically increases survival and functional outcomes.421 However,
the latter studies included patients with acute stroke in
