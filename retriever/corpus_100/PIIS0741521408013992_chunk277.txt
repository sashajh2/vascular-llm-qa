pathophysiology of prosthetic access failure is largely that of
neointimal hyperplasia at the venous anastomosis.
It is important to note that once access occlusion
occurs, prolonged patency is unusual. Thrombectomy, access revision, or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty
usually result in a limited period of patency before failure
recurs. The inability to prolong access pat
