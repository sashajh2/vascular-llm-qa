, and the extent of collateralization. Admittedly, most of these concerns are more
relevant for endovascular revascularization, because it is
usually possible to identify a suitable distal target in
either the SMA or CA for open revascularization. Several
recent studies have reported that endovascular revascularization of the SMA is possible for long segment occlusions and/or severe calciÔ¨Åcations.33,92,93 Endovascular
