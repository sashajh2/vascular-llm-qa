 trap debris released during the procedure.
Distal occlusion devices have the advantage of a smaller
diameter than proximal occlusion devices, but the lesion
must be crossed before the device is placed in the ICA, a
maneuver that can itself cause embolization. At the end of
the procedure, suction is applied between the sheath in the
CCA and the balloon occluding the distal internal carotid
artery to remove debris.
Proximal oc
