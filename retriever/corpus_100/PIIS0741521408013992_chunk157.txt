In autogenous accesses originating from arteries
proximal to the radial, the arteriotomy should be limited
to a maximum length of 4 to 6 mm, using the smaller
anastomoses for those individuals at highest risk of developing steal-induced ischemia, such as those with diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial occlusive disease.
Also, the anastomosis is performed with a continuous
suture to prevent future increase of the anastomotic
surface area. These
