s, there
is no clear evidence that duplex surveillance for CLTI results in clinical benefits for
patients.
Prosthetic bypasses are known to fail more frequently and more early compared to vein bypasses. Similar to vein bypassess, the SVS does not have hard recommendations for when to
perform duplex surveillance.
 Many studies perform duplex at 30 days postoperatively and at 6 month intervals.
 Despite this, the duplex itself does not always always reliably detect intervenable lesions
