ascular treatment remains
unclear. This is especially true of saccular aneurysms
treated with coil or thrombin embolization; unlike formal
exclusion with a covered stent, these aneurysms are not
technically “excluded” from arterial circulation. Indeed,

ultrasound or CT is necessary for patients with visceral
aneurysms treated by embolization because of the risk
of recanalization.111-114
