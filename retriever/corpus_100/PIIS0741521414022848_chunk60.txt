vascular testing, of which the cornerstone is the measurement of the ABI. If the ABI is $1.4 secondary to

noncompressibility of the arteries from calciﬁcation, a
toe-brachial index is a useful alternative because the digital
arteries are frequently not calciﬁed. A toe-brachial index
value of #0.7 is indicative of hemodynamically signiﬁcant
arterial insufﬁciency.38 Although not
