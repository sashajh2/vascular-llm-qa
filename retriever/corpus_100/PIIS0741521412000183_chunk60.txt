idence of residual venous obstruction. Although the iliac
segments frequently lack valves, persistent proximal venous
obstruction may be potentially associated with the development of reflux in more caudal segments that were not
initially thrombosed.28
Not surprisingly, iliofemoral venous thrombosis is associated with severe hemodynamic derangements that may
be persistent.29 Acutely, iliofemoral thrombosis may compromise the primary venous
