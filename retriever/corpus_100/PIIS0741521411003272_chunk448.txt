Laser wavelength, radial fiber, and efficiency. Evidence to support the efficiency of higher-wavelength vs
lower-wavelength laser fibers has been controversial. A
prospective, randomized, single-center, single-surgeon
trial evaluated lasers with 810- or 980-nm wavelengths.243
Thirty legs were treated for each group by a surgeon
blinded for the type of laser. Patients in the 980-nm group
