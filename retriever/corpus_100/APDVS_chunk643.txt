 energy, heating the
vein wall to cause destruction of the endothelium, contraction of vein wall collagen, thrombus
formation, and eventual fibrosis of the vein resulting in a durable ablation (Weiss, Feied, and
Weiss 2001a). The radiofrequency ablation (RFA) catheter should be placed 2 cm from the
saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) so as to prevent endothermal heat-induced thromb
