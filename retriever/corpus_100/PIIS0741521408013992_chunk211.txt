 common cause of persistently elevated
prepump arterial pressure, will be the likely cause.
New autogenous accesses, which have a high incidence
of failure to mature, almost always have an access flow
problem that is on the arterial side of the venous needle and
therefore will be identified by an excessively negative arterial dialysis pressure (ADP). In addition, most of the flowrestricting lesions in dysfunctional radialâ€“ cephalic as well as
some other autogenous accesses, are
