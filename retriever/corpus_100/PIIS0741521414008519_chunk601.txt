iovenous ﬁstula can produce distal venous hypertension if
the ﬁstulas are too large. Because this pressure difference
will negate the purpose of a venous bypass performed
for relief of venous hypertension, use of an arteriovenous ﬁstula should be temporary and its size should
be controlled to avoid excessive ﬂow. A suitably sized
prosthetic sleeve around the ﬁstula is one method to
achieve this
