 with signiÔ¨Åcant hemodynamic
instability post-CEA should be carefully monitored
for associated complications including myocardial
ischemia and ICH.
Post-CAS hemodynamic depression
Hypotension with bradycardia is not uncommon after
CAS owing to stretching of the carotid baroreceptors with
angioplasty and stenting. This complication is increased
four-fold with poststent balloon dilatation.390 Therefore,
careful monitoring
