 Optimization
The radiation dose delivered, particularly for intraoperative exposures, should be optimized
to be as low as possible while still achieving adequate image quality for the procedure and
decision making.
This includes fuoroscopy techniques such as reducing the time under fuoroscopy by using
pulsed fuoroscopy as opposed to continuous scanning, collimating the X-ray beam to
the area of interest and narrowing the beam to only scan structures necessary, adjusting
the frame rate of fuor
