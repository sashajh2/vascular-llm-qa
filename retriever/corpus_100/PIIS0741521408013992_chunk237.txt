 confirms that the
outflow vein is suitable, conversion of this outflow vein into
an upper arm access provides an ideal autogenous alternative that is durable and usually usable immediately, thus
obviating or minimizing the need for a catheter. A separate
imaging study is not usually necessary, because the fistulogram performed for the graft failure can be used to examine
the outflow and central veins.
B. Remote secondary autogenous AV access construction. This strategy involves a physical examination
