astomoses should be
performed to the immediate subrenal segment (ie, the
zone between the renal and inferior mesenteric arteries)

The pattern of iliac disease encountered may be highly
variable. Unilateral disease, with complete occlusion of both
common and external iliac arteries, or occlusion of the
external iliac artery alone, may be approached surg
