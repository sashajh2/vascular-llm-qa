 with correctable anatomic
lesions that are repaired percutaneously or surgically are
much more likely to achieve suitability for dialysis compared with those that do not undergo a corrective

A mature autogenous access requires three components: (1) an adequate diameter to permit safe cannulation
with dialysis needles without infiltration, (2) an adequate
access flow rate to permit achieving an access blood flow of
â±–500 mL/min,87,
