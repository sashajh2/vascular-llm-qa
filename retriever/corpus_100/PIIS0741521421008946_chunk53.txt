 peak systolic velocities. This practice is in contrast
with planning for carotid stenting procedures (CAS), for
which additional imaging of the aortic arch and great
vessels is typically considered mandatory.
The determination of the degree of carotid stenosis is
based on analysis of hemodynamic parameters obtained
from Doppler analysis, including peak systolic and end
diastolic velocities. Ultrasound criteria describing the degree of carotid stenosis should be de
