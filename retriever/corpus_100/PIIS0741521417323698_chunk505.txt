the presence of iliac aneurysmal disease, the distal
anastomosis should be performed immediately proximal
to the iliac bifurcation to reduce the risk of late
aneurysmal degeneration. Patients with symptomatic
aortoiliac occlusive disease may beneÔ¨Åt from distal graft
anastomosis to the distal external iliac or common
femoral arteries. However, graft extension to the femoral
arteries increases
