Branched endografts have side branches built-into the main body of the graft in place of
fenestration. These branches extend from the outer body of the main graft towards the target
vessel.
Additional characteristics about branched grafts:
 They require a larger inner aortic diameter for more space between the endograft and
target artery.
 Branches can receive self-expanding or balloon-expandable stents.
