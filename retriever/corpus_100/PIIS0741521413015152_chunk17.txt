 of CLI, and (2) the failure of most existing systems
to assess and grade the major factors that inﬂuence both
risk of limb loss and clinical management.
As presently deﬁned, CLI is associated with decreased
quality of life, increased risk for amputation, and increased
mortality. The 5-year mortality for CLI patients is 50% to
60%, with coronary events and strokes accounting for at
least 70% of the deaths.
