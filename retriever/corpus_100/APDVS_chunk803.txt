Pseudoaneurysms
A pseudoaneurysm is defined as a collection of turbulent blood fow contained only by one
or two layers of the arterial wall as opposed to a true aneurysm where all three layers are
dilated (occur in less than 1% of endovascular cases). They occur secondary to injury
(iatrogenic or trauma).
These must be managed urgently and treated appropriately to prevent significant
morbidity and mortality.
