Terminology
It is imporant to understanding the terminology related to radiation exposure.
 The absorbed dose refers to the energy from ionizing radiation per unit mass of exposed
material, measured in grays (Gy).
 The equivalent dose represents the mean absorbed dose of a specific organ or tissue,
measured in sieverts (Sv).
 The effective dose, also measured
