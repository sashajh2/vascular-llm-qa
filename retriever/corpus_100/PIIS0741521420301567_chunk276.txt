 migration into the stomach with
development of a fatal aortogastric ﬁstula has been reported after coil embolization of a CAA.131 However, there
are signiﬁcantly fewer reports in the literature of CAAs being
treated by endovascular techniques compared with SAAs.
Because CAAs typically involve the proximal portion of the
celiac trunk, absence of a proximal landing zone may limit
endovascular treatment with coils.
