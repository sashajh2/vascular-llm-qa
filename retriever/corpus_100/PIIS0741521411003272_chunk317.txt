 transilluminated visualization of the
veins to be removed, allows delivery of tumescent anesthetic solution, and performs hydrodissection. Through
segmental counterincisions under direct visualization, the
resector is positioned directly on the varicosity, and with
powered endoscopic dissection, varicosities are mobilized

1.5-mm punch incisions allows for blood that collects in
the
