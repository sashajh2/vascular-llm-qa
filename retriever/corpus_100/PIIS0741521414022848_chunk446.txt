anastomosis to more distal (tibial or pedal) arteries. Surveillance protocols for lower extremity autogenous vein
graft reconstructions were developed to detect graft stenosis before graft thrombosis and were based on this
natural history and the assumption that a patent, hemodynamically uncompromised, lower extremity arterial
reconstruction is optimal for maintaining ambulatory
function and QoL. Failure of an arterial reconstruction
performed for claudication will
