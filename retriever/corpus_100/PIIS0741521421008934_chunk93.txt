CEA vs TF-CAS in symptomatic stenosis
A number of trials have examined the role of TF-CAS in
the management of neurologically symptomatic patients
with >50% diameter stenosis. Several early trials such as
SAPPHIRE (stenting and angioplasty with protection in
patients at high risk for endarterectomy) of high surgical
risk patients demonstrated overall equivalence of CAS
and
