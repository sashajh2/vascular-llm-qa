to evaluate blood fow. To calculate the ABI, the higher ankle pressure (DP or PT) is divided
by the highest arm pressure (left or right).

ABI result of <0.9 has shown to have high sensitivity and specificity with identifying PAD.
Patients with claudication usually have an ABI ranging from 0.5 to 0.9, and those with ischemic
rest pain or tissue loss usually have an ABI less than 0.5.
