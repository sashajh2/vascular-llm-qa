ICA anatomy suggests that compete apposition of filter to
the distal ICA wall may be difficult due to size or tortuosity.
Direct comparison of proximal occlusion with flow
reversal vs distal protection shows that proximal protection
with flow reversal results in the lowest embolic load165,185
However, no device can completely eliminate the risk of
embolization during CAS. The fact that no embolic protection is completely effective and that some
