 that patients undergo duplex ultrasound surveillance and duplex guided interventions to prompt
long-term patency. However, there are no set guidelines for how long and how frequently

 Recommended methods of surveillance include clinic visits, ankle-brachial indexes

 Surveillance intervals can range from 3-6 months.
 Ultimately, there is no strong evidence of benefit of routine duplex surveillance after
endovascular intervention of CLTI; however, patients with the characteristics below may
