 speciﬁc bacterial species present or the number of species of bacteria
present did not relate to healing outcomes.118 They
concluded that their data supported no speciﬁc treatment
of wound bacteria regardless of the type or quantity. On
the basis of these contradictory ﬁndings, we are unable to
generate useful supporting clinical guidelines for treatment
of wound colonization or bioﬁlm without clinical evidence
of infection.
