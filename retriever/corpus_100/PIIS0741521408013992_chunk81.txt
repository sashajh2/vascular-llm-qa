 is easily determined by combining the arterial
ultrasound examination with the venous survey.
Arterial procedural evaluations specific to vascular
access. Noninvasive evaluation. A normal clinical arterial
examination without a history suggesting inflow occlusive
disease may not require a further presurgical evaluation of
the arterial inflow. However, if arterial inflow is not clearly
normal, duplex ultrasound (DU) imaging, performed simultaneously with vein mapping, will aid in identifying
stenotic segments and
