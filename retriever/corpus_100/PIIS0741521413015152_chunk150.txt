Most of the patients in the ischemia 1 and 2 blocks of 16
combinations suffer from “situational ischemia.” As wound
complexity and infection severity increase (a shift down and
to the right in each box of 16), the likelihood that revascularization will be required increases. In the ischemia 3 category, small wounds without infection may not always
require vascular intervention, but such an intervention
may speed healing. Again, shifts down
