 to be signiﬁcant independent predictors of
$80% stenosis: female sex, peripheral vascular disease,
a history of TIA or stroke, a positive smoking history,
and the presence of left main coronary disease. If all patients with at least one of those risk factors were
screened, the mathematical model predicted that 95%
of the patients with $80% stenosis would be identiﬁed
before their cardiac operation.84
