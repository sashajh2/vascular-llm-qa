 be performed. A contrast imaging
study or other imaging studies such as MRA of the access is the
gold standard for documenting stenosis. Because it is expensive and invasive, it should be reserved for those patients in
whom abnormal clinical monitoring or access surveillance
has predicted a high likelihood of hemodynamically
(â¬Ž50%) significant stenosis. This contrast study should
include the arterial inflow, the actual access, its outflow
vein, and central
