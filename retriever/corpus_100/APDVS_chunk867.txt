 radiation.

The ALARA Principles
ALARA stands for “As Low As Reasonably Possible,” and refers to the balance between
minimizing radiation exposure to the patient without compromising the quality of care.
The energy of the X-rays: Higher energy X-rays will have greater penetrance and pass
through thicker and deeper tissue more easily. Energy is typically adjusted during the procedure to optimize for the depth of the structures being imaged.
The duration of exposure: The dose of radiation delivered to the patient
