 However, owing
to rich intracranial collaterals, unilateral severe carotid
stenosis may not correspond with severe cortical

ischemia.637 Therefore, the beneﬁt of improved perfusion
cannot be generalized. Although the aforementioned
prospective longitudinal studies followed relatively
vigorous study protocols, the cognitive beneﬁt of carotid
intervention has not been deﬁnitely established and
thus, cannot be recommended owing to relatively small
