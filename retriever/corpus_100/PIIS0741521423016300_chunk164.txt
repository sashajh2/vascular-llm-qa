predict wound healing in populations with DFU.5 Two
low quality studies were identiﬁed which concluded
that abnormal or absent Doppler waveforms were associated with a small (15%) increase in the likelihood of major amputation,65,66 further limiting its use. Similarly,
there are currently insufﬁcient data to support the use
of TBI to predict healing or amputation outcomes; however, TP (as a component of TBI) has been
