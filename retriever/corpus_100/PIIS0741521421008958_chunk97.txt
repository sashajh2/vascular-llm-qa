 provide estimates of screening yield. These estimates will be highly
relevant for shared decision-making. A single risk factor,
aside from peripheral artery disease, was associated with
low yield. Multiple risk factors greatly increase the yield of
screening and can justify a screening recommendation.
Evidence on the timing of interventions in patients with
combined carotid and coronary disease was sparse and
imprecise. Patients without carotid symptoms who had
the carotid intervention Ô¨Årst, compared with a
