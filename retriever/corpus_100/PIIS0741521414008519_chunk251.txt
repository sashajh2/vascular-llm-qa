 the disease processes. Further
research in this exciting ﬁeld is necessary to have a better understanding of the processes leading to CVD and
to determine whether patients with venous ulcers have
certain characteristic metabolic proﬁles that will allow
improved targeted therapy in both the prevention and
active treatment of CVD and VLUs. Another potential
mechanism for the development of CVD and VLUs is
hypoxia in the dermis and apoptosis of the vein wall
