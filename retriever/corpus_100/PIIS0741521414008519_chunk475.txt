owmetry showed that
sustained compression with a pressure around 40 mm
Hg increases the arterial ﬂow under the bandage in
normal volunteers.308 Similarly, a recent study performed
in patients with VLUs and concomitant arterial occlusive
disease (ABI of 0.5 to 0.85) demonstrated by multiple
metrics that arterial blood ﬂow is even augmented by inelastic bandages.309
