 studies used the same
outcome measure, we used the original scale and
expressed results as a weighted mean difference. Rate
ratios (ie, the ratio of the incidence rate of events within
a given time between the intervention and the comparison) were calculated for AEs. The DerSimonian and
Laird random effects method was used to combine effect sizes. We evaluated heterogeneity between studies
using I2 indicator. Analyses were based on the intentionto-treat principle for
