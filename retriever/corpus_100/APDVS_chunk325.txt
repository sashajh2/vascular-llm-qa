 penetrate the arterial wall and become oxidized. These
oxidized lipids trigger an infammatory response. The bodyâ€™s immune system responds to the
infammatory signals by sending white blood cells (macrophages) to the site. These cells engulf
the oxidized lipids and form foam cells within the arterial wall. The infammation leads to
the proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Over time, the combination of lipids, immune cells,
and smooth muscle cell proliferation results in
