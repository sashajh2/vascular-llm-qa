 been previously discussed. However, it is important to recognize that the beneÔ¨Åts of medical therapy and exercise are actually quite
modest. In a recent prospective study, absolute walking distance improvement with a home-based exercise program,

The effect of such a modest improvement on functional
ability and QoL may be inadequate for many patients.
