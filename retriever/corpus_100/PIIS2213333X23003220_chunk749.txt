uating the incidence of thromboembolic complications after thermal ablation (12 RCTs, 19 case series) or
FS (12 RCTs, 6 case series), the individual incidence of
EHIT, DVT, and PE was <1% for all treatment modalities
(RFA, laser ablation, FS). Differences between treatment
modalities were judged not to be clinically meaningful.
While thrombotic complications after isolated endovenous ablation are
