in response to the chronic reduction in blood fow. While collateralization can help improve
perfusion to some extent, it may not fully compensate for the lost function of the original,
diseased arteries. In advanced stages of PAD, when the arterial obstruction is severe, collateralization may become insuï¬€cient, leading to continued symptoms of intermittent claudication,
pain, and impaired wound healing.

Anatomic Distribution of PAD
The distribution of disease in PAD varies among different risk groups such as
