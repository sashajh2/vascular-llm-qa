 by OSR or EVAR, we suggest antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent graft infection before any dental procedure involving the manipulation of the gingival or
periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral
mucosa, including scaling and root canal procedures.

We also suggest antibiotic prophylaxis before respiratory
tract procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures, and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures if the potential for infection exists or the patient is
immunocompromised.
