is generally benign, durable beneﬁt at low risk is required
to justify invasive vascular treatment. The anatomic spectrum of disease in IC is broad, and has a major impact
on both technical success and durability of vascular interventions. In selecting a revascularization strategy for
patients with IC, the expected durability in the circumstance at hand should be carefully considered. We suggest
that a minimal effectiveness threshold for invasive therapy
in IC be a >50% likelihood of sustained clinical improvement for
