 the situation is amenable to getting a CT angiogram to measure anatomic dimensions, several
components of the aneurysm anatomy should be assessed to determine anatomic suitability for
EVAR. These include the length, width, angulation of the aneurysm, and presence of disease
at the aneurysm neck (i.e. the aortic segment between the lowest renal artery and the proximal
extent of the aortic dilatation).
