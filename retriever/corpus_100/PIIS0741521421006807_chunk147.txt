of the runoff vessels.
Our literature review suggests that younger age, the
availability of single-segment GSV, challenged runoff vessels, and lower operative risk favor the choice of OPAR.
However, greater equipoise for EPAR is present with
advancing age, an insufÔ¨Åcient GSV, the presence of satisfactory landing zones and tibial runoff, and higher operative risk. In the absence of robust comparative data,
thoughtful judgment by an experienced vascular surgeon retains prim
