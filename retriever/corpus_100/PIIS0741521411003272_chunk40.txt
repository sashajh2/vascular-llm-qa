juvant treatment to superficial
vein ablation for the prevention of ulcer recurrence.
10. Open venous surgery
For treatment of the incompetent great saphenous vein, we suggest
high ligation and inversion stripping of the saphenous vein to the
level of the knee.
To reduce hematoma formation, pain, and swelling, we recommend
postoperative compression. The recommended period of
compression in C2 patients is 1 week.
