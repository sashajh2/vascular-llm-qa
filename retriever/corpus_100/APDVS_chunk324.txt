 cells, and fibrous tissue within the inner layers
of arteries, forming plaques. The process typically begins with damage or dysfunction of the
endothelial lining of the arterial walls. This can be caused by risk factors such as hypertension,
smoking, or high cholesterol levels. In response to endothelial injury, low-density lipoproteins
(LDL) or “bad” cholesterol molecules penetrate the arterial wall and become oxidized. These
oxidized lipids trigger an infammatory
