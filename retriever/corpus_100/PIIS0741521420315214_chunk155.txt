 rupture, preoperative imaging should
be adequate to evaluate whether the patientâ€™s anatomy
is amenable to endovascular repair. This typically consists
of CTA of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (from above the
clavicles to the femoral heads) to evaluate the proximal
and distal seal zones and to evaluate for vascular access
options. If coverage of the LSA is planned, CTA through
the head and neck is useful to determine the anatomy
