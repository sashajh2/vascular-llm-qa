 yield was
for a combination of diabetes, coronary artery disease,
and renal failure (47%; 95% CI, 29%-65%), followed by
coronary artery disease and renal failure (43%). Having
a single risk factor such as isolated hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or diabetes was associated with low yield
(2%, 2%, and 3%, respectively), whereas peripheral artery disease alone was associated with a yield of 18%.
