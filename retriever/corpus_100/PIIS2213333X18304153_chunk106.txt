ema, and superﬁcial phlebitis; immediate
compression allows more direct apposition of the
treated vein walls, which in turn enhances sclerosis and
decreases thrombus formation.38 The physiologic effects
of graduated compression include increased blood ﬂow
velocity in the deep veins, increased prostacyclin production, increased local capillary clearance, increased transcutaneous oxygen pressure, increased expelled capillary
volume at exercise, and increased release of plas
