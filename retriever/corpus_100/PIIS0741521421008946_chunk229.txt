 signiﬁcant risk of stent fracture and
deformation. As a result, heavily calciﬁed carotid bifurcation lesions are a relative contraindication to stent
placement. Early data suggest that long, complex,
and echolucent lesions may be treated safely with
TCAR because of proximal ﬂow reversal before crossing
the stenosis. However, the level of evidence to support
this observation is much lower than that for CEA
