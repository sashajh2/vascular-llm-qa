 point of greatest ICA
stenosis with the lumen of the normal distal cervical
ICA.51 Percent stenosis is calculated as: (1 e minimal residual lumen/normal distal cervical ICA diameter)  100.
However, an alternative method was used in the European Surgical Carotid Trial (ECST).37 The ECST technique
indexed minimal residual lumen to the diameter of the
carotid bulb (as opposed to the
