Osm/kg).137
However, rates of CIN for iopamidol (Isovue-370, 796
mOsm/kg, nonionic) are similar to those for iodixanol,
which suggests that other physiochemical properties,
apart from osmolarity, are important determinants of
CIN.138 Likewise, several randomized trials of ionic
and nonionic contrast agents have demonstrated no
difference in CIN
