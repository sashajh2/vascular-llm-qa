 Flat-line:
 A fat waveform (i.e. no wave) does not necessarily indicate no blood fow. A fat wave
form simply refects the lack of pulsatile blood fow.

Doppler
Doppler devices (handheld or otherwise) provide similar information to PVR studies. Instead
of providing a visual representation of pulsatile fow, Doppler signals (sounds) are an auditory
representation of fow. A triphasic pulse generates a tri
