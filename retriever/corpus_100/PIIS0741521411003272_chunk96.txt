aphenous veins in the calf and the
thigh. The saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) is the confluence of superficial inguinal veins, comprising the GSV
and the superficial circumflex iliac, superficial epigastric,
and external pudendal veins. The GSV in the thigh lies in
the saphenous subcompartment of the superficial compartment, between the saphenous fascia and the deep
fascia.
