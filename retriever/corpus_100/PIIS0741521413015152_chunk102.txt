ABI, Ankle-brachial index; PVR, pulse volume recording; SPP, skin perfusion pressure; TP, toe pressure; TcPO2, transcutaneous oximetry.
Patients with diabetes should have TP measurements. If arterial calciÔ¨Åcation precludes reliable ABI or TP measurements, ischemia should be documented by
TcPO2, SPP, or PVR. If TP and ABI measurements result in different grades, TP will be the
