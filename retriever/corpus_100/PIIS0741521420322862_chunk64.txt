 CA, SMA, and IMA with collateral contributions
via the internal iliac artery, most notably the hemorrhoidal arteries. The gastroduodenal and pancreaticoduodenal arteries provide connections between the CA and
SMA. The marginal artery of Drummond and the arc of
Riolan (meandering or central anastomotic artery lying
in the mesentery close to the inferior mesenteric vein)
connect the inferior mesenteric (via the left colic artery)
