 of venous patency and preservation of
valve function. Routine use of systemic thrombolysis for
acute DVT was discouraged by high rates of incomplete
thrombolysis and bleeding complications. For example, a
pooled analysis of six randomized trials found systemically
administered streptokinase was 3.7 times more likely than
heparin to produce “greater than minimal” thrombolysis,
although at the expense of a 2.9-fold increase
