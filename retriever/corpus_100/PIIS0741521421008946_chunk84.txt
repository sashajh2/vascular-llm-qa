 trials assessing
the inﬂuence of blood pressure reduction on stroke prevention among patients with asymptomatic carotid stenoses.
However, a meta-analysis of 25 randomized clinical trials
including patients without documented vascular disease
demonstrated signiﬁcant decreases in the incidence of
late strokes (relative risk reduction 45%; 95% CI, 35-55),
and stroke reduction was proportional to the reduction in
systolic blood pressure.
