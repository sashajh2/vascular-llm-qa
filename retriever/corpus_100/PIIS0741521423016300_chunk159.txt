 pressure (TcPO2) measurement or a skin
perfusion pressure (SPP) to assess likelihood of healing.
A TcPO2 $ 25 mmHg increases the pre-test probability of
healing by up to 45% and value < 25 mmHg increases the
pre-test probability of major amputation by approximately
20%. An SPP $ 40 mmHg increases the pre-test probability of
healing by up to
