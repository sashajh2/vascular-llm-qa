 presenting with atherosclerotic arterial occlusive disease. A high index of suspicion is, therefore, necessary to distinguish patients with chronically symptomatic
PAAs from those with symptoms due to peripheral arterial
occlusive disease (PAD). PAAs can also present with
rupture, although this is rare.1 Compressive symptoms
resulting in venous congestion, leg swelling, deep vein
thrombosis, and/or neuropathy have also been reported
but are very uncommon.
