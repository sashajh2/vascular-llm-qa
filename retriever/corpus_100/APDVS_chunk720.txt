Ultrasound Guided Access
There is emerging evidence to suggest real time identification of anatomic structures with US
guidance may decrease the risk of access-related complications. A summary to the steps of
US-guided access of the CFA are included below.
Identifying the correct vessel:
1. Obtain baseline peripheral pulses.
2. Obtain a micropuncture kit, containing a hollow needle, guidewire, and catheter
3. Using the
