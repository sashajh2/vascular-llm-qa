 vein is identified through a transverse incision in the antecubital fossa.
The radial artery is identified through a longitudinal incision overlying the palpable radial artery pulse. An appropriate length of great saphenous vein is harvested from the
lower extremity. The great saphenous vein is translocated
to the forearm in a superficial and lateral tunnel between
the antecubital vein and the radial artery to perform the two
anastomoses.
