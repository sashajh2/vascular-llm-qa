ducibility) of the tests is important in determining their clinical effectiveness. The systematic review showed that the reliability of both the ABI and
TBI was good to excellent. However, these tests are limited
by wide margins of error, which affect the amount of
change required for this to be considered a true change
rather than related to error in the measurement. For
example, an ABI measured by the same rater requires a
change of 0.15 to be considered a true
