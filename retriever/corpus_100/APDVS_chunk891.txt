Before delving into the various risks associated with radiation exposure, it’s essential to provide
a brief overview of the types of radiation effects. These effects can be broadly categorized into
deterministic and stochastic effects.
Deterministic effects, also known as non-stochastic effects, occur when specific radiation
dose thresholds are exceeded leading to adverse outcomes. They are dose-dependent and
result in significant damage, such as cell death in a specific organ. Examples of deterministic
