of lymphatic collaterals, and softens ﬁbrotic tissue. This is
suggested as a good adjunctive treatment in some resistant
ulcers associated with venolymphatic edema, but there is
no formal supporting evidence.495 One RCT showed that

affected by dermatoﬁbrosis in patients with chronic ulcerated
lesions but did not show beneﬁt in ulcer healing.
