 sign impacts patient outcomes after transfemoral CAS.
High risk for TCAR. Similar to transfemoral CAS,
circumferential or large bulky carotid bifurcation plaques can limit the ability to deliver the stent across
the lesion. Carotid bifurcation stent placement in
heavily or circumferentially calciﬁed lesions has been
associated with signiﬁcant risk of stent fracture and
deformation. As a result, heavily cal
