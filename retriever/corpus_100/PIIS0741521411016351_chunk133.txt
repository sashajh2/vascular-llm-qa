 in these
studies. These studies also identified that the risk of contralateral carotid artery stenosis progression depends on the
existing disease at the time of the initial CEA.91-93 The risk
of progression for moderate stenosis at the initial surveillance to severe stenosis can be as high as five times.92
Several large prospective studies94-99 have analyzed the
rate of carotid in-stent restenosis after
