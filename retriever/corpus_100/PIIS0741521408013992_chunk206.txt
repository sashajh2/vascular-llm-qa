,
type of dialysis machine, and the patient’s blood pressure.
Better standardization can be achieved by measuring static
VDP (at zero dialysis pump blood flow). VDP needs to be
normalized for the systemic blood pressure. The ratio of
systolic VDP to systemic systolic blood pressure can be
suggestive of stenosis when the ratio of systolic VDP to
systemic systolic blood pressure is ⬎ 0.4.97 Use
