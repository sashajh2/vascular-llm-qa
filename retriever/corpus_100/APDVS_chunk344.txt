clerosis narrows and sometimes occludes
the arteries that supply blood to the limbs. The resulting reduced blood fow causes
tissue ischemia (insuﬀcient blood supply) and hypoxia (insuﬀcient oxygen supply) to
the tissues distal to the narrowing or occlusion. To combat this, the body initiates a
response to create alternate pathways for blood fow.
