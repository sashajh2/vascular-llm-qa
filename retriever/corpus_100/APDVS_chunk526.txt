 from noncardiac sources.
The most common etiology of cardiac emboli is atrial fibrillation, a condition that causes
uncoordinated contractions of the atrium leading to stasis of blood and clot formation (typically
in the left atrial appendage) which can then embolize. Other common cardiac sources include,
but are not limited to, left ventricular aneurysms, mural thrombi in the ventricles, endocarditis,
and valvular disease
