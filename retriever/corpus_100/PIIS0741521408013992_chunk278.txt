 result in a limited period of patency before failure
recurs. The inability to prolong access patency after occlusion reflects several challenges, including the difficulty of
correcting the primary lesion responsible for access failure,
alteration in graft thrombogenicity, persistence of secondary lesions, or a combination of these factors. Moreover,
the injury caused by angioplasty of the stenotic lesion can
itself promote accelerated neointimal hyperplasia. Because
