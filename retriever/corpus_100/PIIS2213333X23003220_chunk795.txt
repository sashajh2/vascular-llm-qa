 for the management of DVT and is therefore indirect, for the management of ARTE the level of evidence has been
downgraded to C.
Further research is needed regarding the natural history
of ARTE. More data is particularly needed regarding the
value of anticoagulation vs serial follow-up and the duration of anticoagulation in treated patients. Given the uncertainty of the evidence, at present, duration of
anticoagulation should be at the judgment of the
clinician.
