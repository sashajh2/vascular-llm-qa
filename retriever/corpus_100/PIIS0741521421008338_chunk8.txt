 natural history suggest that
thromboembolic complications and amputation develop at a mean observation time of 18 months and they are frequent.
One study showed that at 5 years, approximately one-half of the patients had complications.
Conclusions: This systematic review provides event rates for outcomes important to patients with PAAs. Despite the low
certainty of the evidence, these rates along with surgical expertise and anatomic feasibility can help patients and
surgeons to engage in shared decision-making
