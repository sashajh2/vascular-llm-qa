 In addition, although not recommended for routine surveillance, a recirculation study
can help in select cases of autogenous access dysfunction to
confirm inadequate access flow because recirculation results
when access flow falls below dialysis blood pump demand.
This study has little value with a prosthetic access because
prosthetic accesses will usually thrombose at low flows that
do not support adequate dialysis, whereas autogenous accesses will remain patent at very low flows, thereby permitting inadequate dialysis to proceed
