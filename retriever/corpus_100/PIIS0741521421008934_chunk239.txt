risk of stroke and, therefore, many would prefer combined treatment to potentially decrease their risk with
one procedure. However, if patients are severely symptomatic from either coronary disease or carotid disease,
they might be more likely to wish for symptomatic relief

rather than overall risk reduction. If anatomically suitable,
CAS seems favorable for symptomatic patients. In addition, patients with CAD amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention should undergo such intervention,
followed by treatment of the carot
