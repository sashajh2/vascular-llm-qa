 mechanical and thrombolytic therapy (pharmacomechanical thrombolysis) may increase the lytic effect, reducing the procedural time. Depending on the

successful revascularization.
Failure to establish a bypass target vessel using either
lytic or operative methods can necessitate amputation,
depending on the patient’s clinical condition.40,42 Limbs
