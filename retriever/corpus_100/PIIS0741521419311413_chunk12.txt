) depends on Patient risk, Limb severity, and
ANatomic complexity (PLAN). The proposed new Global
Anatomic Staging System (GLASS) replaces previously
used classiﬁcations; it deﬁnes a preferred target artery
path (TAP), estimates limb-based patency (LBP), and
establishes stages of complexity for interventions. GLASS
is used to determine the likelihood of limb salvage and
the best route to achieve it.
