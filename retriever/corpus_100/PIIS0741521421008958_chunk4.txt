 were performed when feasible.
Results: Medical management compared with carotid interventions in asymptomatic patients was associated with
better early outcome during the ﬁrst 30 days. However, CEA was associated with signiﬁcantly lower long-term rate of
stroke/death at 5 years. In symptomatic low-risk surgical patients, CEA was associated with a lower risk of stroke, but a
signiﬁcant increase in myocardial infarction compared with CAS during the
