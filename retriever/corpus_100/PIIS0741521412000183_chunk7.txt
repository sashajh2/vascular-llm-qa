 and strongly
recommend their use in patients with limb-threatening ischemia due to iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction (Grade
1A). We suggest pharmacomechanical strategies over catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis alone if resources are

Conclusions: Most data regarding early thrombus removal strategies are of low quality but do suggest patientimportant benefits with
