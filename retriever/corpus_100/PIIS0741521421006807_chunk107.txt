 B, moderate

quality; and C, low quality. Conclusions based on highquality evidence are unlikely to change with further
investigation. In contrast, those based on moderatequality evidence are more likely to be affected by future
research. Finally, those based on low-quality evidence are
the least supported by the current data and the most
likely to be subject to change in the future. On occasion, a
GRADE 1 recommendation can be made from low-quality
(C) evidence.
