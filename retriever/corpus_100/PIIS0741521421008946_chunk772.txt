Diagnosis
Duplex ultrasound examination is frequently used for
routine follow-up after CAS. The degree of lumen diameter reduction, peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, and the ratio of peak ICA to CCA velocity (ICA/CCA
ratio) are the most common parameters used to quantify
stenosis. In selected cases when results of duplex ultrasound examination are inconclusive, CTA is required. Discrepancies in results with either
