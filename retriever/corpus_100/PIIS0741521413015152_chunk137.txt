 wounds and severe infection
may lead to amputation even in the absence of signiﬁcant
ischemia. Conversely, minor wounds or wounds with
mild/moderate ischemia may heal with adequate debridement and wound care alone. Accordingly, we undertook
a similar Delphi process to classify the WIfI combinations
into four groups (very low, low, moderate, and high) based
on projected beneﬁt from anatomic revascularizationd
from no
