ned, but in two
studies reporting the outcomes of participants with diabetes and limb ischaemia who were not revascularised,
the limb salvage rate was around 50% at one year.73,100
Analysis of the evidence for revascularisation suggests
that revascularisation in appropriately selected people
with diabetes and haemodynamically signiÔ¨Åcant PAD,
can improve perfusion, expedite wound healing, and
reduce major limb amputations.6
