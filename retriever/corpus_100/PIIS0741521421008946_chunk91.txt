 pressure is associated with development of carotid
atherosclerosis,64-66 and other research indicated that
reduction in carotid pulse pressure was associated with
a parallel reduction in intima-media thickness.67 Further,
there is evidence that antihypertensive therapy may slow
progression of carotid atherosclerosis and possibly promote plaque regression.68 However, a more recent
meta-analysis demonstrated that calcium channel
blockers reduce intima-medial
