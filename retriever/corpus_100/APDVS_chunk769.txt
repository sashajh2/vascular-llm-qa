 balloon
inside the stent to achieve a specific diameter based on the pressure used to infate the balloon. As the diameter of the stent increases with higher balloon pressure, the length of stent
decreases.
Key characteristics of balloon-expandable stents:


Rigid
Large profile
Maintains shape over time
More accurate deployment
High radial force (higher risk of dissection)

ÄŽ Tip
Highly tortuous vessels often require a self-expanding stent because of the increased
