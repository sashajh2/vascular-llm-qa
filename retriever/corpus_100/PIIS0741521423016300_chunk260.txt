 PAD, and either a foot ulcer or
gangrene, how does endovascular revascularisation
compare with open or hybrid revascularisation?

Recommendation 17
In a person with diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and a foot
ulcer or gangrene who has an adequate single segment
saphenous vein in whom infrainguinal revascularisation is
indicated and who is suitable for either approach, consider
bypass in preference to endovascular therapy.
