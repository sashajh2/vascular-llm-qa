 selection of the CCA. A glide wire is advanced
into the mid CCA. Some catheters are compatible with
the 6F guiding sheath, which allow for telescoping the
sheath over the catheter and the glide wire without exchange to dilator. The sheath is advanced into the mid to
distal CCA, avoiding the lesion. The use of a stiff wire into
the ECA may facilitate advancing the sheath into the
mid/distal CCA
