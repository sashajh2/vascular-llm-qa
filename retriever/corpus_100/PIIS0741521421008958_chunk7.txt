iﬁcant difference on outcomes during the ﬁrst 30 days. Registry data show good results with
CEA performed in the ﬁrst week, but not within the ﬁrst 48 hours. A single risk factor, aside from peripheral artery disease,
was associated with low carotid screening yield. Multiple risk factors greatly increase the yield of screening. Evidence on
the timing of interventions in patients with combined carotid and coronary disease was sparse and imprecise.
