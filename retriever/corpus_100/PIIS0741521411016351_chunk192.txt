 current evidence
does not suggest the routine use of platelet function or
genetic testing for clopidogrel resistance. In the absence of
randomized trial data, the general approach to patients
developing clinical events while taking aspirin or clopidogrel has been to confirm compliance and increase the
dosage, followed by the addition or substitution of another
antiplatelet agent.149 However, data in this area are insufficient to allow clear recommendations.
