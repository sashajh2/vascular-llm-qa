 that RFA was found to be the most
reliable means of IPV closure. After failed FS attempts,
IPV closure was enhanced when thermal ablation was
used as a secondary technique. A common factor
leading to increased failure in all groups was morbid

this study, only three with C2 disease were included
and all three were treated with foam initially, thereby
signiÔ¨Åcantly limiting the applicability
