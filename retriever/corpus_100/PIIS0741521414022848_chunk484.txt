catheter-based interventions, making prophylactic interventions on the basis of duplex data highly questionable.
Clinical follow-up and hemodynamic assessment alone after infrainguinal EVT has been proposed. Tielbeek et al263 reported a prospective assessment of 124 patients during a 5-year
period who underwent EVT for femoropopliteal disease.
Although a duplex-detected Vr >2.5 at the intervention site
predicted subsequent occlusion of
