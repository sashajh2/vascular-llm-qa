 when
blood fow becomes turbulent it can often be heard (bruit) or palpated (thrill). Although
murmur and bruit are synonymous, audible turbulence originating from the heart is called
a murmur. Outside of the heart, audible turbulence is referred to as a bruit. The presence
of a bruit does not necessarily indicate significant arterial stenosis.
Pulses are described as:






0 or absent
1+ or diminished
2+ or normal
