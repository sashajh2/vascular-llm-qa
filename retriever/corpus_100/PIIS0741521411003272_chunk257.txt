 with simple varicose
veins (class C2), the SVS/AVF Guideline Committee suggests graded prescription stockings with an ankle pressure
of 20 to 30 mm Hg (GRADE 2C). The most common
length recommended is knee-high stockings, although
thigh-high stockings and pantyhose are also available and
may be appropriate for many patients. Skin breakdown and

frank necrosis after incorrectly measured or applied garments have been reported.1
