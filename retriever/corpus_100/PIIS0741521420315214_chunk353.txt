 is used when
a patient presents in extremis. Within these limitations,
it appears that TEVAR for ruptured DTA is associated
with improved survival and lower morbidity compared
with open repair.5
Recommendation 35: We recommend TEVAR over
open repair for the treatment of ruptured DTA when it
is anatomically feasible. Level of recommendation:
Grade 1 (Strong), Quality of Evidence: B (Moderate)

SURVEILLANCE AFTER TEVAR
