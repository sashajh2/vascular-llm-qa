 biplane imaging includes
anterior-posterior (renal and aortoiliac), lateral (SMA and
celiac arteries), and right anterior oblique views (IMA)
for optimal visualization of speciÔ¨Åc vessels. The anteriorposterior projections are helpful to visualize the branches
of the SMA and its collaterals, including the gastroduodenal and marginal arteries, whereas the lateral projection is optimal to view the origins of the CA and SMA
given their posterior-anterior orientation
