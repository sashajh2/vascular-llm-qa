 less hyperpigmentation (RR, 0.57; 95%
CI, 0.40-0.80) in the laser group. There was more resolution or improvement of telangiectasias in the combined laser and polidocanol group compared with
polidocanol alone (low-certainty evidence). Laser treatment may result in less hyperpigmentation (moderatecertainty evidence). Further well-designed studies are
required to provide evidence for other available
