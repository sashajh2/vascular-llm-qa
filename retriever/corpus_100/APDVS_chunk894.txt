itâ€™s conceivable that patients could experience post-operative adverse events solely due to the
effects of radiation exposure.
In contrast, stochastic effects result from repeated exposure to radiation levels below a certain
threshold. A notable example of stochastic effects is cancer. Stochastic effects are probabilistic
in nature. For example, the likelihood of developing leukemia after a single chest X-ray is low.
However, if someone were to undergo a head-to-toe CT scan daily for a
