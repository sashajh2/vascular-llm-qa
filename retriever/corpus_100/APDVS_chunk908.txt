 specifically examining the incidence of thyroid cancer following
radiation exposure in adults. While some studies suggested an increased risk of cancer
in adults exposed to radiation, the relative risk at a dose of 10 mGy (milligray) was deemed
insignificant. In other words, the risk did not show a significant elevation at this particular
dose level.
While a definitive link between radiation exposure and thyroid cancer in adult populations
remains elusive, several studies have hinted at a
