 reproductive health.
Radiation exposure to male reproductive organs can disrupt spermatogenesis, depending
on the stage of sperm development. The damage from ionizing radiation may lead to decreased
sperm motility, increased fragmentation, and DNA alterations. (Wdowiak et al. 2019)

Hematologic Disease and Radiation Exposure
Prolonged low-dose radiation exposure has the potential to cause serious hematological effects. Numerous studies, including those conducted outside the medical field,
