 rate-controlled atrial fibrillation stopped coumadin prior
to a colonoscopy 1 week ago. He is otherwise healthy and takes no other medications.
He presents with pain in his left calf after walking two miles in 90 degree temperatures.
He is found to have both absent pulses and doppler signals in both his dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial arteries in that leg. This is accompanied by pallor and pain. What is the
most likely etiology?
