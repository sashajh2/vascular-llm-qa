uosity can increase the risk of technical
failure and stroke. In particular, the presence of ICA
tortuosity can make crossing the lesion and positioning
a distal embolic protection ﬁlter difﬁcult. In the
tortuous ICA it may be difﬁcult to ﬁnd a sufﬁcient
length of carotid artery above the lesion with parallel
walls, a challenge that may decrease the effectiveness
of distal embolic protection �
