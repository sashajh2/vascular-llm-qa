a varying distance. In addition, a normal autogenous access
collapses when the extremity is elevated. Clinical clues of a
stenosis of an autogenous AV access include the presence of
a palpable pulse at the arterial end with possible faint thrill
or complete access collapse proximally, a discontinuous
bruit, or failure to collapse with arm elevation. The physical
examination can be used to estimate access diameter, its
depth
