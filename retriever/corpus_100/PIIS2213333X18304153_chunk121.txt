 Hg for 3 weeks enhanced
the efﬁcacy of sclerotherapy by improving vessel

disappearance. Three weeks of continuous compression led to the best results, although even 3 days of
compression resulted in greater improvement
compared with no compression. Compression also
led to a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in hyperpigmentation after sclerotherapy.44
Two studies compared thigh-high compression
stockings vs bandaging after liquid sclerotherapy. The
