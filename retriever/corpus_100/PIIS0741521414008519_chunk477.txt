 for ankle systolic pressure $60 mm Hg, digital pressure $30 mm Hg or ABI $0.50 with close monitoring,
but only after consultation with a vascular specialist.309,312
Use of ankle perfusion pressure of 60 mm Hg or greater
rather than ABI #0.5 as a cutoff for compression is
preferred because this correlates better with tissue perfusion pressure, and any sustained external compression pressure should never exceed this cutoff
