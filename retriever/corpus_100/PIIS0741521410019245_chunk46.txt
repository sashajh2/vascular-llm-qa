 traumatic thoracic aortic injury. There was a consensus, however, that arch conformation represented the single greatest unmet need given the curvature of the thoracic
aorta at the location of the injury. Inability to conform to
this curvature can result in malapposition of the endograft,
which can lead to endoleak and endograft collapse.16 The
aortic diameters are relatively smaller in the younger subset
of trauma patients. Currently, available thoracic
