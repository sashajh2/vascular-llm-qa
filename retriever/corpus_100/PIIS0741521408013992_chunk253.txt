enosis in the
main trunk increasing resistance to axial flow. Such a lesion
must be addressed before side branch obliteration. Generally, these branches must be â¬Ž2 mm diameter to be considered significant and associated with a poorly maturing

Localization of the side branch can be achieved by
visual inspection, ultrasound scanning, or angiography.
Road mapping of the access and side branch facilitates
accurate marking of the side branch for either an endovascular or surgical approach
