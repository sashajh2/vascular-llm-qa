 exercises (individual or in group) can improve
both calf muscle function and ankle mobility. The
improved function of the calf muscle pump results in
both improved ejection fraction and residual volume of

and endurance, self-perceived exertion, mobility, and physical activity level.485-487 A recent literature review that studied the importance of
