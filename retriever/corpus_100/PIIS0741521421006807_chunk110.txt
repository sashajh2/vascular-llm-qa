 endovascular approach, unless it was
clearly inferior in terms of its effect on these outcomes.
This is consistent with the patient values derived from
other similar contexts in vascular surgery, such as abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).51 Interviews with patients
with small AAAs have demonstrated that they cared the
most about postoperative morbidity and mortality
compared with the need for surveillance and the risk of
long-term problems with endovascular repair.51
