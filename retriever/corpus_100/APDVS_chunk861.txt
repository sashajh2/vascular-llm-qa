 specific organ or tissue,
measured in sieverts (Sv).
 The effective dose, also measured in *8sieverts (Sv),** accounts for total-body radiation
exposure and is guided by the International Commission on Radiological Protection
(ICRP) guidelines for comparing radiation effects on individuals.
X-ray technology for imaging comprises two critical components: the radiation source, where
X-ray photons are generated, and the detector.
 The shape of the beam from the source is managed by the coll
