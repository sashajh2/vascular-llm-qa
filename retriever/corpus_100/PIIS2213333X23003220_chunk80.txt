For patients with symptomatic reﬂux in the major superﬁcial venous trunks and associated varicosities undergoing initial
ablation alone, we recommend follow-up for >3 months to assess the need for staged phlebectomy or ultrasound- guided
sclerotherapy for persistent or recurrent symptoms. Longer follow-up is recommended for those with recurrence or more
advanced CEAP class.
