ation is inﬂammation within the venous
circulation that is subjected to increased hydrostatic pressure resulting in increased ambulatory venous pressure.45
The inﬂammation involves leukocytes (in particular

macrophages and monocytes), inﬂammatory modulators
and chemokines, cytokine expression, growth factors,
metalloproteinase activity, and many regulatory pathways
that perpetuate inﬂammation.46-48
