 through the
arterial line. The KDOQI Guidelines recommend monthly
measurement of access flow. It requires specialized equipment and a trained technician.
2. Static venous dialysis pressure. The greatest value of
static venous dialysis pressure (VDP) is in prosthetic accesses, but is of little or no value as a surveillance tool for
autogenous accesses because of the high incidence of lowflow etiologies proximal to the venous needle in autogenous accesses where V
