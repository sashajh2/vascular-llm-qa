, thereâ€™s a caveat
regarding a false sense of security. Due to the scattering of radiation during procedures, the
eye can be exposed to radiation at oblique angles (i.e. around the glasses), leading to increased
exposure and limited reduction in dose. (Kirkwood et al. 2020) In such scenarios, the optimal
solution for reducing eye exposure would be a full visor or face shield with lateral eye
shielding. A study by Sam
