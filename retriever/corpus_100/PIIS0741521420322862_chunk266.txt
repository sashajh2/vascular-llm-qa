tandem lesions, and the extent of involvement (ie, lesion
length). Multiple reports have documented successful
endovascular revascularization for these scenarios,
although the long-term patency rates for these higher
risk lesions remains unclear and the requisite skill set
may not be universal. The use of balloon-expandable
intraluminal stents has replaced balloon angioplasty
alone for the treatment of de novo lesion. Balloonexpandable covered stents seem to have better
