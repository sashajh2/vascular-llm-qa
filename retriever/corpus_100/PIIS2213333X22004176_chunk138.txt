acquired in the dependent position as a transverse,
anterior wall to posterior wall measurement. Spectral
Doppler waveforms with the extremity or extremities in
a dependent position demonstrating the baseline ﬂow
and response to distal augmentation must be recorded.
If present, the reﬂux duration of retrograde ﬂow must
be measured with calipers in the following segments:
