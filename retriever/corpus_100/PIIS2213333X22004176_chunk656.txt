Judgment

How substantial are desirable anticipated
effects of the strategy?

Decrease in perioperative pain and earlier
return to normal activity and reduced risk of
varicosities at 5 years are more likely with
endovenous venous intervention; HL&S was
associated with higher anatomic closure
rates at 30 days and 5 years compared with
RFA and UGFS, with no signiﬁcant difference
compared with EVLA
