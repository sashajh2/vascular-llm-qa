 support the recommendation is noted.
Evidence is divided into 3 categories: A (high quality), B
(moderate quality), and C (low quality). Conclusions based
on high-quality evidence are unlikely to change with further study, those based on moderate-quality evidence are
more likely to be affected by further investigation, and
those based on low-quality evidence are the least supported
by current data and the most likely to be subject to change
in the future.
