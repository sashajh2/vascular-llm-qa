VLU prevalence increased with age. Two other studies
examined large populations. Approximately 40,000 Polish
patients underwent clinical evaluation and interviews by a
variety of health care professionals in a multicenter study
showing a 1.5% prevalence of C5/C6 disease.7 Another
cross-sectional study carried out in France addressed a
subset of patients from a larger study of Raynaud patients.
