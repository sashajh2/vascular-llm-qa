 material
in the power injector when possible (typically to 50%

(faster injection of smaller doses) can usually compensate when additional visibility is required. Level of

Recommendation 25: We suggest the use of on-table
mapping software options on Ô¨Åxed-imaging X-ray
systems, such as roadmapping and computed tomography
