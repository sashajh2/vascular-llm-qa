on the endothelium, which in turn must compensate to
prevent further injury and maintain integrity of the
vascular wall. In CVD, the sine qua non is persistent
elevated ambulatory venous pressure. The effect on the
microcirculation begins with altered shear stress on the
endothelial cells, causing endothelial cells to release vasoactive agents and to express E-selectin, inï¬‚ammatory
molecules, chemokines, and prothrombot
