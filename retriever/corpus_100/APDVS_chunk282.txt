 cuff is placed above the ankle. The Doppler probe is used to locate the
dorsalis pedis (DP) or posterior tibial (PT) pulse. The pressure cuff is infated until the
Doppler signal is obliterated, and then the cuff is then slowly released. The pressure at
which the Doppler signal returns is the ankle pressure. The same process is repeated for
both legs (DP and PT signals) and both arms. The arm pressure must be
