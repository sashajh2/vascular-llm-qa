 therapy. The study
demonstrated that patients with the shorter duration
of compression had a greater reduction in leg volume
and experienced a lower number of complications.
Postoperative pain and time to full recovery did not differ
between the groups. The study concluded that wearing
compression stockings for a shorter time was not inferior
to compression for a longer time. It was not reported in
this study how many (if any) patients had underlying
deep venous insufÔ¨Åciency.
