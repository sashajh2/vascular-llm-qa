 patients with claudication will not experience limb loss.
Only 1-3% of claudicants develop critical limb ischemia and the complications associated with
more severe PAD. While the majority of patients (70-80%) have stable claudication symptoms,
approximately 20-30% of patients experience a worsening of their claudication. In terms of
overall morbidity and mortality, patients with claudication have worse overall outcomes than
the general population.
