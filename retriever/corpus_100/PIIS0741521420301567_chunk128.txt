al renal artery branches cannot be
adequately assessed on conventional cross-sectional imaging (CTA), we
recommend the use of catheter-based angiography.

RAAs occur in approximately 0.1% of the population,
although the absolute incidence is unknown.9 Autopsy
studies are likely to underestimate RAA incidence at
0.01% to 0.09%,10,11 whereas angiographic studies are
likely to overestimate this at 0.
