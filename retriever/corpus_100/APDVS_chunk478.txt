graft or at surveillance sites.
 Duplex surveillance and intervention based on duplex findings lead to better patency
rates of the vein graft.
 Though there are no set guidelines for frequency of surveillance. Many studies in the
literature often perform surveillance 30 days postoperatively and at 3-6 months intervals.
 Ultimately, though duplex surveillance does result in better patency of vein grafts, there
is no clear evidence that duplex surveillance for CLTI results in clinical benefits for
