 superior to DSA in determination
of exact degree of plaque stenosis and arterial anatomy, sacrifice the physiologic information
offered through DSA that speak to fow patterns, fow direction and turbulence. Axial imaging
of CTA and MRA can define patency but do not speak to the dynamic nature of blood fow
or directionality of fow.
Definitive determination of fow and directionality can be augmented to a carotid artery stenosis
