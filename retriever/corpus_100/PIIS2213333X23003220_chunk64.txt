 outcome.
Nonthermal techniques are better for ablation of reﬂuxing distal calf saphenous veins, to avoid thermal nerve injury.

5.2.6.

In patients with an epifascial or superﬁcial saphenous vein, thermal ablation may result in skin burns, hyperpigmentation, or
induration, while nonthermal techniques may cause hyperpigmentation or induration. Miniphlebectomy or limited stripping
is safe and effective if the
