uting coronary stent requiring open
aneurysm repair, we recommend discontinuation of P2Y12
platelet receptor inhibitor therapy 10 days preoperatively
with continuation of aspirin. The P2Y12 inhibitor should be
restarted as soon as possible after surgery. The relative risks
and beneÔ¨Åts of perioperative bleeding and stent thrombosis
should be discussed with the patient.
