 tendency to overestimate the degree of
carotid stenosis. The sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing 70% to 99% stenosis with time-of-flight MRA are
identical to DUS imaging (88% and 84%, respectively);
however, MRA has a tendency to “over-read” stenosis,
making it difficult to differentiate more moderate (50% to
69%) from severe stenosis. Similarly, high
