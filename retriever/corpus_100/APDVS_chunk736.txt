Coating
 Wires have a hydrophilic or hydrophobic coating.
 Hydrophilic wires have less friction when moving along the vessel wall and track more
closely along the vessel lumen, increasing the risk of dissection.
 Hydrophilic wires are preferable in highly tortuous vessels.
 In contrast, hydrophobic wires keep more distance from the vessel wall and are less likely
to dissect.
