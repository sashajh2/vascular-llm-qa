ankle pressure (e.g., < 50 mmHg) or ABI (e.g., < 0.5) may be
associated with a greater likelihood of impaired healing and
greater likelihood of major amputation.
7. In a person with diabetes and a foot ulcer or gangrene, consider
performing a toe pressure measurement to assess likelihood of
healing and amputation.
A toe pressure $ 30 mmHg increases the pre-test probability of
healing
