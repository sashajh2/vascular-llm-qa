Intraoperatively surgeons will often ask for the pressures of the balloon before using. Noncompliant balloons have a nominal pressure, which is the average pressure in atmospheres
(atm) required to infate the balloon to its predetermined size, and a burst pressure, where
99.9% of balloons will not burst if infated to this pressure.
