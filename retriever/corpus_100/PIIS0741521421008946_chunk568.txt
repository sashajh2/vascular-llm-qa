sheath to conﬁrm proper position. Technical advantages of
this technique include ease of direct access, use of short
wire and catheters, and the ability to clamp the proximal
CCA providing CEA-like cerebral protection before lesion
manipulation. Prior studies demonstrate a signiﬁcant
decrease in the incidence of silent ischemic lesions after
TCAR compared with transfemoral CAS using diffusionweighted MRI.380,381 The risk of DWI in
