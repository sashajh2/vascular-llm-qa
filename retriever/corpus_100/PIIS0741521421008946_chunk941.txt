 show an improvement in cognitive function after carotid revascularization procedures. Presumably, improved cerebral perfusion and removal of
embolic source have a positive impact on brain health.
Qu et al630 showed that CEA for severe carotid stenosis
following a minor stroke improved neurocognitive,
ophthalmic, and acoustic functions compared with
those did not receive treatment. Several prospective
case-control studies showed that successful revascularization improves long-term cognitive performance
