 form of intra-arterial contrast,
either iodinated contrast or gadolinium, respectively. However, they offer a fuller perspective
of relevant anatomy and a more precise determination of stenosis within the limitations of the
modality, with MRA often overestimating the degree of stenosis due to intrinsic properties of
MRA imaging acquisition. Both CTA and MRA, although superior to DSA in determination
of exact degree of plaque stenosis and arterial anatomy, sacrifice
