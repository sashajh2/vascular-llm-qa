, the SSV, the accessory saphenous veins, and the perforating veins.
The four components that should be included in a
complete duplex scanning examination for CVD are (1)
visibility, (2) compressibility, (3) venous flow, including
measurement of the duration of reflux, and (4) augmentation. Asymmetry in flow velocity, lack of respiratory variations in venous flow, and waveform patterns at rest and
during flow augmentation in the common fem
