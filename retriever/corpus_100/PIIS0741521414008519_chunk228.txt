 cause leukocyte adhesion, and
inﬂammation leads to injury and loss of the glycocalyx.64,65 A key component of inﬂammation and in the
VLU is the expression of MMP and cytokines, which
have signiﬁcant effects on the vein wall and venous valve,
the endothelium, and probably the glycocalyx and surrounding tissues, including destruction of the dermis
with eventual skin changes and ulcer formation.48
