 generate a concise set of recommendations. The strength of any given recommendation and
the quality of evidence were graded on the basis of the
GRADE approach.3 The quality of evidence derived
from randomized trials has an initial rating of high,

modify this initial rating; these domains include risk of
bias, consistency of the results across studies, directness
of the populations and interventions of the
