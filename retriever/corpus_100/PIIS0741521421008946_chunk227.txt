olization while crossing the lesion as well
thrombus disruption and embolization after stent
placement. Similarly, long, complex lesions can increase risk of embolization during placement of the
distal EPD and should, therefore, be approached
cautiously when considering transfemoral CAS.175 It is
unclear how the presence of a carotid string sign impacts patient outcomes after transfemoral CAS.
High risk for TCAR. Similar to transfem
