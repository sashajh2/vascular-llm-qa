 This pressure is influenced by anything
that causes restriction of flow to the pump: the needle
gauge and length, the diameter and length of the blood
line, needle position in the access, and access blood flow.
After any needle or tubing problem has been checked as the
possible cause of unexpected increasingly negative arterial
dialysis pressure and corrected, inadequate access flow,
which is the most common cause of persistently elevated
prepump arterial pressure, will be the likely cause.
