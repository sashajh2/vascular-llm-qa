medical care alone and stenting therapy combined with
optimal medical care. Stenting provided greater
improvement in peak walking time than optimal medical
care alone. Measures of improvement in QoL were both
greater for supervised exercise and stenting therapy
compared with optimal medical care alone, but improvement in QoL parameters was greater for stent revascularization than supervised exercise. A conceptually similar
