 in rat venous tissue to cause venous dilation by several mechanisms, including hyperpolarization
and inhibition of extracellular calcium mobilization,
which are tightly regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor
(HIF).68-70 In a study evaluating varicose veins in CVD
patients, it was determined that HIF-1a and HIF-2a
transcriptional factors were overexpressed compared
with control nonvaricose veins, suggesting that
