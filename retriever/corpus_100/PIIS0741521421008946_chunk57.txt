 to 80% or greater. Typical duplex criteria to identify stenosis at this level include an end diastolic velocity
of more than 140 cm/second.47
The major limitations of duplex ultrasound examination include dependence on a skilled operator and the
inability to completely image the proximal and intracranial vasculature. Certain anatomic features such as severe vascular calciÔ¨Åcation and arterial tortuosity can
also decrease the accuracy of duplex imaging
