flow obstruction, and should rarely be considered as an isolated procedure. A decrease in compartmental
pressures will accompany successful relief of outflow obstruction53 and usually obviates the need for fasciotomy.
We suggest that fasciotomy only be considered if compartment pressures in the thigh or calf remain elevated (â¬Ž30
mm Hg) despite efforts to restore iliofemoral venous outflow using the procedures outlined above (Grade 2C).
