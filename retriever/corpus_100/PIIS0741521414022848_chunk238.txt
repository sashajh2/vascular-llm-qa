 the tissue displaced (especially
calciﬁc disease). This may necessitate undersizing the stent relative to the diameter of the native normal-caliber aorta to reduce
the risk of rupture, which has been reported with this approach.
In general, care should be taken not to preclude

such as by extending stents into the perirenal aorta. Stents
should not be placed across the oriﬁce of
