 of multiple
renal arteries may limit the surgeon’s ability to plan a
successful endovascular treatment. In such cases, preoperative three-dimensional rotational catheter-based
angiography may be of great beneﬁt in planning optimal
working angles.22 Furthermore, three-dimensional rotational catheter-based angiography has been shown to
be advantageous compared with two-dimensional catheter-based angiography in 75% of cases in evaluating the
neck, feeding arteries, and relationship between
branches of
