Here is the Rutherford classification of acute limb ischemia:
Stage I: viable limb that is not immediately threatened (intact motor and sensory function,

Stage IIa: marginally threatened and salvageable limb if properly treated (intact motor
function and sensory deficit in the toes [or none at all], with often inaudible arterial
signal)
