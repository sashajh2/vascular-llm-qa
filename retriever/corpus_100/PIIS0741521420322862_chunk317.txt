revascularization, autogenous vascular reconstruction,
the avoidance of primary bowel anastomoses in the
setting of ischemia, and liberal use of a second-look

The perioperative management of patients undergoing
open revascularization for CMI is comparable with that
for patients undergoing other open aortic procedures.
The obligatory ischemia/reperfusion injury can lead to
