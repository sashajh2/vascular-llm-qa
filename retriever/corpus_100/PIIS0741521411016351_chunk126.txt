 be prevented in the long-term by the rapid availability of
CDUS imaging in contrast with other imaging, and the
good sensitivity of imaging in detecting significant stenosis.
However, the Health Technology Assessment highlighted
the concern of the accuracy of DUS in diagnosing 50% to
69% stenosis, which carries a sensitivity of only 36% and a
specificity of 91%.86
The utility of CDUS will depend on the clinical
