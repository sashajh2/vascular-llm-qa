 that both the vein wall and the
valve are involved in the primary events leading to venous
disease. Whether the vein wall changes precede valve
insufﬁciency or the valve insufﬁciency causes wall distention and wall changes is less clear.46 More important, evidence demonstrates that both vein wall and vein valve
are pathologically altered to cause primary venous disease. The perturbation in the microcirculation is a critical
component in the pathoph
