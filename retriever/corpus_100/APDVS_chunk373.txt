 These waveforms are seen in arteries serving well-perfused tissues where resistance is low, and blood fow is unimpeded.
Triphasic waveforms are commonly observed in the larger arteries of the extremities, such
as the femoral and brachial arteries.
 Biphasic Waveform:
 A biphasic waveform displays two phases: an initial forward fow during systole (when
the heart contracts and ejects blood) followed by brief reverse or “refected” f
