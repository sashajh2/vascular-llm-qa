-invasive Hemodynamic Testing
In terms of non-invasive testing, as stated above, a combination of ABI and PVR is the gold
standard in establishing a diagnosis. As a review, the ABI is a non-invasive test that compares
blood pressure in the ankle with blood pressure in the arm. ABIs are calculated by dividing
the systolic ankle pressure by the highest systolic arm/brachial pressure (between the two
arms).
An ABI value: - X >
