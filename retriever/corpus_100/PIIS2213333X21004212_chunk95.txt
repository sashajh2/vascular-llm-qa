 the GSV of >500 ms).
One study24 had an intermediate risk of bias,
compared DUS with HHD examination (deÔ¨Åned as
continuous wave Doppler only with no color or gray
scale imaging or use of pulsed Doppler examination).
The study demonstrated that the sensitivity of the
HHD technique was 73% at the SFJ, 77% at the SPJ,
and 51% for thigh perforators. In primary
