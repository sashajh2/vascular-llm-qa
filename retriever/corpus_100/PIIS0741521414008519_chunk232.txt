 in high quantities in VLUs and the associated wound ï¬‚uid, and there
is a correlation of increased expression of proteinase activity with poor healing. The regulation of MMP production and function, although not fully understood, is likely
to be linked to cytokines, urokinase plasminogen activator, EMMPRIN (extracellular MMP inducer
CD147), platelet-derived growth factor AA, and
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.7
