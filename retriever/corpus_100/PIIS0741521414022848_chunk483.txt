 treated segment occlusion rate of 37.6% at 3 months after
treatment of long-segment (>8 cm) tibial lesions, despite
high rates of clinical success and limb salvage in most patients
with Rutherford 4 and 5 ischemia. These and other studies
suggest that unlike vein graft surveillance, duplex-derived
patency is poorly correlated with the clinical success of
catheter-based interventions, making prophylactic interventions on the basis of duplex
