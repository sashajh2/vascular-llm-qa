 accuracy of DUS imaging. Carotid stents will
decrease compliance of the vessel wall and flow velocity.72
DUS imaging may also fail to differentiate between subtotal and total carotid occlusion. Intravenous administration
of contrast agents may improve diagnostic accuracy,73,74
but the safety of these agents has been questioned.
Power Doppler and contrast DUS imaging can be used
to differentiate between preocclusive stenosis and complete
occlusion.
