 care, including wound bed preparation,
control of bacterial colonization and infection, and
débridement techniques and frequency, which are all critical to achieving healing outcomes. Novel diagnostic
methods under development for the rapid identiﬁcation
of bacteria and inﬂammatory cytokine levels will likely
result in the need for additional comparative effectiveness
research in the near future for clinicians to decide on best
practice options. Use of these diagnostic modalities may
allow patient-speciﬁc therapeutics to
