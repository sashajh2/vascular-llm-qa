functional access maybe even harmful because the patient may continue to be dialyzed using percutaneous catheters, with their intended complications, while waiting for
the autogenous access to dilate and mature.

functional.12 Failure to mature is more frequently an issue
with autogenous AV accesses than prosthetic grafts. As
recommended by the FFBI, every new autogenous access
should be evaluated for development at 4 weeks
