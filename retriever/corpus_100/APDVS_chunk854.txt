 or materials (lead) absorb a greater fraction of radiation while less
dense tissues (skin) or materials (water) allow for deeper penetration.
This concept is especially relevant to vascular surgeons and their patients as an increasing
proportion of vascular procedures are performed endovascularly under live fuoroscopy which
utilizes X-rays.
