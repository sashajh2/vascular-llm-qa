 angiography or ultrasound.
In certain patients, compromised renal function puts
them at increased risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.
In an effort to avoid the nephrotoxic effects of iodinated
contrast agents, non-contrast-enhanced MRA has been
used to assess the renal arteries. MRA can be performed
with a “breath-hold” steady-state free precession
sequence or time-spatial labeling inversion pulse technique. Studies evaluating steady-state free precession sequences have shown
