aphenofemoral junction (SFJ) so as to prevent endothermal heat-induced thrombosis (EHIT).
Similarly, EVLA delivers laser energy to an area, resulting ultimately in fibrosis and occlusion
of the target vein (Perrin et al., n.d.a).
Non-thermal non-tumescent (NTNT) ablation methods offer alternatives to heat-based vein
treatments, employing techniques such as mechanochemical ablation (MOCA), cyano
