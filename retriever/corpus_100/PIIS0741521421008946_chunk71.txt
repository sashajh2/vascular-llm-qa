 deÔ¨Åning the degree of stenosis is essential
to proper patient selection and management. As noted
earlier, duplex ultrasound examination is the most
widely used technique for evaluation of ICA stenosis.
Velocities and other hemodynamic parameters obtained from the duplex ultrasound examination are
used to infer degree of stenosis based upon validated
data in comparison to formal arteriography. In most
of the seminal trials comparing CEA with medical therapy, degree of stenosis
