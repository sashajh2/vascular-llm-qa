Indirect findings in the common femoral vein, including continuous venous flow, absent respiratory variation,
and continuous flow with Valsalva, may suggest proximal
obstruction but cannot exclude nonocclusive thrombus or
extrinsic compression. Contrast venography may similarly
fail to demonstrate the pelvic veins due to contrast dilution
by the unopacified deep pelvic veins.42
Because multiple venous segments are usually
