 The presence of an intraluminal stent can confound the determination of the degree of stenosis on CT scans, similar to the scenario with
DUS imaging. Noncontrast images can be helpful to
interrogate the stent architecture. A catheter-based
arteriogram with the measurement of intraluminal
pressures may occasionally be helpful in equivocal cases
to determine the hemodynamic signiÔ¨Åcance of a recurrent stenosis.77
