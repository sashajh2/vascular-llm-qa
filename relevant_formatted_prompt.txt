D. Thrombosis from hypotension.
E. Thrombosis from hypercoagulability
Answer
A. Embolus as a result of his atrial fibrillation.
Discussion: The two major causes of acute arterial occlusion are emboli and thrombosis.
An embolic source accounts for 80% of cases. Sources of emboli include the heart, usually
in patients with a history of atrial fibrillation or myocardial infarction or valvular heart
disease. A proximal arterial source, usually an atherosclerotic plaque or aneurysm, or a
paradoxical emboli, in which venous emboli cross a patent foramen ovale to embolize in
the arterial tree, are also common sources of an occlusive embolus. The most common
sites in the lower extremity for emboli to become lodged are, in descending order, the
femoral, iliac, aorta, and popliteal arteries. While a paradoxical embolus is possible, it is
less common. This patient is relatively healthy, so hypotension is unlikely. The patient
is not hypercoagulable.

tomography angiogram shows a cutoff sign at the left femoral at the bifurcation of the
superficial femoral artery and the profunda femoris artery. Which of the following physical examination findings would be seen in this man if your suspected etiology is an acute
arterial embolism?

Document 2:  day since he was 20 years old. He states that it is diﬀcult for him to walk 3 blocks
without having to stop which he finds particularly annoying. When asked where it hurts, he
starts grabbing his calves. He describes an achy, cramping, and pain in his calves whenever he
walks, mostly on the right side. He denies any new sores or wounds that are not healing.

Exam
HEENT: pupils equal round reactive to light, no lymphadenopathy
Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm (RRR)
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation in all lung fields. No accessory muscle use.
Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, no pulsatile masses felt.
Vascular/Extremities: Warm, no edema present. Minimal hair appreciated bilaterally.
Non-palpable distal pulses. Bilateral femoral pulses appreciated. No wounds or sores noted.

Note
By the end of this chapter, students will:
 Define chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) and summarize its etiology and
pathophysiology.
 Identify the clinical features and diagnostic criteria used to diagnose CLTI.
 Elaborate on the complications and potential consequences of untreated CLTI.
 Outline a comprehensive history and physical examination to evaluate patients with
suspected CLTI.
 Interpret diagnostic tests such as ankle-brachial index (ABI), Doppler ultrasound,
and angiography to confirm the diagnosis.
 Develop and implement a management plan for patients with CLTI, including
medical, endovascular, or surgical interventions.

Key Facts
1. Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) refers to a severe and advanced form of
peripheral arterial disease (PAD) characterized by chronic inadequate blood supply
to the lower extremities for greater than 2 weeks.
2. CLTI presents as ischemic rest pain,
Document 3: -year-old man with a history of uncontrolled diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension presents to the emergency department for pain in his left leg. A computed
tomography angiogram shows a cutoff sign at the left femoral at the bifurcation of the
superficial femoral artery and the profunda femoris artery. Which of the following physical examination findings would be seen in this man if your suspected etiology is an acute
arterial embolism?
A. Reproducible buttock pain after ambulation, atrophy of calf muscles, erectile dysfunction,
and absent femoral pulses.
B. Bilateral decreased foot sensation, bilateral lower leg pain that is relieved with elevation,
and palpable pedal and femoral pulses.
C. Calf pain that is reproducible after ambulating 50 feet, which resolves with rest, monophasic pedal signals, and palpable femoral pulses.
D. Decreased foot and lower leg sensation, lower leg pain, leg pallor, decreased temperature
compared to contralateral leg, and absent pedal and femoral pulses.
E. Loss of sensation over the foot, complete loss of motor function at the ankle joint, and
mottling of the skin on the foot, absent pedal pulses, and palpable popliteal and femoral
pulses.
Answer
D. Decreased foot and lower leg sensation, lower leg pain, leg pallor, decreased
temperature compared to contralateral leg, and absent pedal and femoral

Discussion: An arterial embolism refers to an acute event where thrombogenic material
lodges in an arterial tree, usually at a branching point. Various etiologies exist, including
septic and cardiogenic sources. In a patient with atrial fibrillation, a laminated thrombus
with a cardiac origin is likely the cause of his embolus. As previously mentioned, when an
embolus occurs, it often becomes lodged at an arterial bifurcation, usually at a narrowed
peripheral location where the arterial caliber changes. One of the more common locations
for obstruction is the common femoral artery at the bifurcation of the superficial femoral
artery and profunda femoris, which can lead to an acute arterial cutoff sign as seen in
the computed tomography angiogram described in this case. Patients presenting with
acute limb ischemia classically present with one

2. A 72-year-old male with diabetes presents to his PCP’s oﬀce for a nonhealing ulcer to the
plantar aspect of his right foot. Laboratory results and x-ray imaging are unremarkable.
On examination, you note that his pulses are nonpalpable. Doppler examination reveals
monophasic signals. He has necrotic, nonviable tissue to the base of the wound. There is
no erythema or evidence of abscess. The patient has not been taking antibiotics. What
is the most likely cause of the non-healing in this scenario?
A. Pressure
B. Infection
C. Inadequate wound care
D. Peripheral vascular (arterial) disease
Answer
D. Peripheral vascular (arterial) disease
Discussion: This patient has nonpalpable pulses and monophasic doppler signals. Along
with necrotic tissue to the wound base, these findings are consistent with peripheral artery
disease (PAD). You may choose to order ankle-brachial index/pulse volume recording
studies. He should be referred to a vascular specialist for further workup before any
intervention is made. He does not have erythema or evidence of abscess on examination,
and therefore it is not likely that primary infection is the cause of nonhealing. The
scenario does not state what type of wound care the patient was receiving. In the presence
of PAD, the type of wound care does not matter as much until the PVD is addressed
first. Without adequate blood fow to a wound, the wound will not have the nutrients
and cells necessary to heal. Bader MS. Diabetic foot infection. Am Fam Physician.
