Question: A 56-year-old man with chronic rate-controlled atrial fibrillation stopped coumadin prior to a colonoscopy 1 week ago. He is otherwise healthy and takes no other medications. He presents with pain in his left calf after walking two miles in 90 degree temperatures. He is found to have both absent pulses and doppler signals in both his dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries in that leg. This is accompanied by pallor and pain. What is the most likely etiology?
Choices:
A. Embolus as a result of his atrial fibrillation.
B. Embolus that originated from an aortic plaque.
C. Paradoxical embolus.
D. Thrombosis from hypotension.
E. Thrombosis from hypercoagulability

Observation of small, <3-cm, true aneurysms therefore
seems an appropriate approach except in women of
childbearing age.
Additional suggested indications for intervention in
SAAs include patients with portal hypertension, patients
who may require liver transplantation, patients whose
aneurysm has a nonatherosclerotic or nondegenerative
cause, and patients whose aneurysm demonstrates interval growth >0.5 cm/y.97

performed operation. This is clearly required when the
aneurysm involves intrasplenic branches within the
splenic parenchyma. Distal pancreatectomy may occasionally be warranted in treatment of these distal lesions
as well.98,99 Laparoscopic repair of SAA by clipping or
exclusion has been reported; intraoperative ultrasound
is believed to be an important adjunct to this procedure.100 Combined laparoscopic occlusion and coil embolization has been proposed as a treatment method for

In patients with ruptured SAA discovered at laparotomy, we suggest treatment with

In patients with ruptured SAA diagnosed on preoperative imaging studies, we suggest
treatment with open surgical or appropriate endovascular techniques based on the

proposed that the origin of venous reflux in patients with
primary varicose veins can be local or multifocal structural
weakness of the vein wall and that this can occur together or
independently of proximal saphenous vein valvular incompetence. Varicosities can also develop as a result of secondary causes, such as previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT),
deep venous obstruction, superficial thrombophlebitis, or
arteriovenous fistula. Varicose veins may also be congenital
and present as a venous malformation.
Varicosities are manifestations of CVD.51,52 CVD includes various medical conditions of long duration, all
involving morphologic and functional abnormalities of the
venous system manifested by symptoms or signs (or both),

Document 4:  with arm elevation. The physical
examination can be used to estimate access diameter, its
depth from the skin, the presence of collateral veins and the
presence of accessory veins.
If upon clinical evaluation at 4 to 6 weeks the autogenous access is not clearly maturing adequately, further
investigation is warranted to identify potentially remediable
anatomic lesions. These may include a venous or arterial
stenosis, competing veins, large patent branches, or excessive depth from the skin.27 The assessment may be performed either by DU scanning or by an imaging study.
Several studies have demonstrated that at least 80% of
immature autogenous accesses can be salvaged after correcting one or more underlying lesions.84,85 Moreover,
immature autogenous accesses with correctable anatomic
lesions that are repaired percutaneously or surgically are
much more likely to achieve suitability for dialysis compared with those that do not undergo a corrective
procedure.86
A mature autogenous access requires three components: (1) an adequate diameter to permit safe cannulation
with dialysis needles without infiltration, (2) an adequate
access flow rate to permit achieving an access blood flow of
ⱖ500 mL/min,87,88 and (3) it must be sufficiently superficial to permit recognition of landmarks and accurate, safe
cannulation.27 The access blood flow increases dramatically
within 24 hours of autogenous access placement and
reaches most of its maximum flow within 3 to 6 weeks.89,90
Similarly, most of the increase in access diameter is achieved
within 4 to 8 weeks of autogenous access placement.87
When the clinical examination is equivocal, a postoperative DU study can be helpful. Specifically, measurement of
the vein diameter and access blood flow is useful in predicting access functionality. When the vein diameter is ⱖ4 mm
and the access blood flow is ⱖ500 mL/min, there is a 95%
likelihood that the autogenous access will be usable for
dialysis. If the vein diameter is ⬍4 mm and the access blood
flow is ⬍500 mL/min, only 33% of autogenous accesses are
likely to be suitable for dialysis. If only one of the two
criteria is met, the likelihood of access success
