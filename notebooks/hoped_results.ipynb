The intervals between her sepsis got\\nshorter lately and the control of her sepsis became more difficult, to manage.\\n\\nThe past history reveals that she was born with a swelling of the left lower leg,\\nincluding her toes but did not receive any treatment. Before she reached her men-\\narche she developed a similar swelling on her right side starting from the mid-thigh\\nregion downwards. Initially her limb swellings were relieved by nocturnal elevation\\nbut soon improvements diminished following recurrent local sepsis.\\n\\nThe patient neglected medical care until puberty, and her limb condition deterio-\\nrated steadily following repeated episodes of sepsis through the year. The pitting\\nnature of her swelling was now replaced with a rubbery firm leg, which became\\nmassively swollen during the last few months.\\nExamination in the ER revealed extremely swollen bilateral limbs. There was a\\nresolving patch of redness along the left buttock but no clear evidence of infection.\\nA shallow decubitus ulcer (3.0 \\u00d7 3.0 \\u00d7 0.5 cm) was identified in right presacral\\nregion without evidence of invasive infection.\\nThis ulcer recently developed lately when the patient became bed-ridden second-\\nary to the debilitating swelling of her lower limbs.\\nThe patient was promptly resuscitated to stabilize her condition. Due to her labile\\nvital signs however, the patient required admission to the intensive care unit for\\nfurther management.\\n\\nFollowing the control of systemic sepsis, the management of her limb swelling\\nremained a challenge especially since she gained over 40 kg from 55 to 99 kg fol-\\nlowing abandoned therapy.\\n\\nFollowing successful management of her crisis, further investigations and assess-\\nments of her swollen limbs were carried out to establish a long term care plan.

Performing an ankle-brachial index (ABI) requires an appropriately sized manual blood pressure cuff and a hand-held, continuous-wave Doppler probe. The patient should be in the supine position and allowed to rest before the examination begins. The blood pressure cuff is placed above the ankle. The Doppler probe is used to locate the dorsalis pedis (DP) or posterior tibial (PT) pulse. The pressure cuff is inflated until the Doppler signal is obliterated, and then the cuff is then slowly released. The pressure at which the Doppler signal returns is the ankle pressure. The same process is repeated for both legs (DP and PT signals) and both arms. The arm pressure must be measured with the Doppler probe and the manual blood pressure cuff. To calculate an ABI, the higher ankle pressure (DP or PT) is divided by the highest arm pressure (left or right). Note that the higher arm pressure is used to calculate the ABI for both legs. For this specific case, the highest arm pressure is 150. To calculate on the right, 165/150=1.1, on the left 120/150=0.8. A normal ABI is 0.9 to 1.2. Patients with claudication usually have an ABI ranging from 0.5 to 0.9, and those with ischemic rest pain or tissue loss usually have an ABI less than 0.5.

The patient's age, medical history, and the severity of the thrombosis can influence the outcome.\\n\\nIn general, the thrombolytic therapy aims to dissolve the blood clot and restore blood flow. The goal is to achieve a high percentage of complete lysis, which means that the clot is dissolved completely. However, the exact percentage of complete lysis can vary depending on several factors, including the patient's overall health, the extent of the clot, and the effectiveness of the thrombolytic therapy.\\n\\nWithout specific information about the patient's condition and the effectiveness of the thrombolytic therapy, it is difficult to provide an exact percentage of complete lysis. However, a general guideline is to expect a high percentage of complete lysis after thrombolytic therapy for axillary/subclavian vein thrombosis. The response to treatment can vary, and it is important to closely monitor the patient's progress and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.\\n\\nIt is recommended that the patient consults with a healthcare professional who can assess their specific case and provide personalized medical advice.
