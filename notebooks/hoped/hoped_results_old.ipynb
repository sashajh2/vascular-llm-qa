The intervals between her sepsis got\\nshorter lately and the control of her sepsis became more difficult, to manage.\\n\\nThe past history reveals that she was born with a swelling of the left lower leg,\\nincluding her toes but did not receive any treatment. Before she reached her men-\\narche she developed a similar swelling on her right side starting from the mid-thigh\\nregion downwards. Initially her limb swellings were relieved by nocturnal elevation\\nbut soon improvements diminished following recurrent local sepsis.\\n\\nThe patient neglected medical care until puberty, and her limb condition deterio-\\nrated steadily following repeated episodes of sepsis through the year. The pitting\\nnature of her swelling was now replaced with a rubbery firm leg, which became\\nmassively swollen during the last few months.\\nExamination in the ER revealed extremely swollen bilateral limbs. There was a\\nresolving patch of redness along the left buttock but no clear evidence of infection.\\nA shallow decubitus ulcer (3.0 \\u00d7 3.0 \\u00d7 0.5 cm) was identified in right presacral\\nregion without evidence of invasive infection.\\nThis ulcer recently developed lately when the patient became bed-ridden second-\\nary to the debilitating swelling of her lower limbs.\\nThe patient was promptly resuscitated to stabilize her condition. Due to her labile\\nvital signs however, the patient required admission to the intensive care unit for\\nfurther management.\\n\\nFollowing the control of systemic sepsis, the management of her limb swelling\\nremained a challenge especially since she gained over 40 kg from 55 to 99 kg fol-\\nlowing abandoned therapy.\\n\\nFollowing successful management of her crisis, further investigations and assess-\\nments of her swollen limbs were carried out to establish a long term care plan.

While the initial workup (including plain abdominal X-ray) was largely unremarkable, it doesn't rule out many serious conditions. A contrast-enhanced CT scan is excellent for visualizing abdominal organs, detecting inflammation, infection, bowel ischemia, perforation, or other intra-abdominal emergencies.\\n \\n * **Differential Diagnosis:** The patient's history and initial findings raise several possibilities, including:\\n \\n  * **Perforated Viscus:** Although the abdomen is soft, a small perforation could be present, especially given the epigastric pain and prior discomfort after meals. CT can often detect free air or fluid.\\n  * **Bowel Ischemia:** The segmental dilatation of the small bowel on X-ray is concerning for possible ischemia. CT angiography can visualize the mesenteric vessels and identify blockages or other vascular abnormalities.\\n  * **Pancreatitis:** While amylase and lipase were normal, early or atypical pancreatitis can sometimes present with normal enzyme levels. CT\",\n          \"Here's why malignancy is the most appropriate underlying abnormality to investigate in this scenario:\\n \\n * **Unprovoked DVT:** The patient has a DVT without any obvious provoking factors like surgery, trauma, immobilization, or a known hypercoagulable disorder. This significantly raises the suspicion for an underlying malignancy. Malignancy is a well-established risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), including DVT.\\n \\n * **Mechanism of Malignancy-Associated Thrombosis:** Cancer cells can promote thrombosis through several mechanisms:\\n  * **Direct Activation of Coagulation:** Cancer cells can express procoagulant factors like tissue factor, which initiates the coagulation cascade.\\n  * **Release of Procoagulant Substances:** Tumors can release substances that activate platelets and the coagulation system.\\n  * **Inflammation:** Cancer often induces a chronic inflammatory state, which can contribute to hypercoagulability.\\n  * **Compression of Vessels:** Tumors can compress blood vessels, leading to stasis and increased risk of thrombosis.\\n  * **Cancer Treatment:** Some cancer treatments (e.g., chemotherapy) can also increase the risk of thrombosis.\\n \\n * **Age:** The patient is 55\",\n          \"Here's why all the listed options are acceptable corrective options for limb-threatening steal syndrome following proximal access construction:\\n \\n * **A. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA):** Steal syndrome can sometimes be exacerbated by stenosis or occlusion in the inflow artery proximal to the AV fistula or in the outflow artery distal to the fistula. PTA can open up these narrowed vessels, improving blood flow to the distal limb and alleviating the steal.\\n \\n * **B. Flow reduction procedures (banding, plication, or tapering of the AV fistula):** Steal syndrome occurs when the AV fistula diverts too much blood away from the distal limb. Reducing the flow through the fistula can restore adequate perfusion to the hand and fingers. Banding, plication, or tapering are surgical techniques to constrict the fistula, thereby reducing its flow.\\n \\n * **C. AV fistula closure:** This is the most definitive solution. If the steal syndrome is severe and other measures fail, closing the AV fistula will eliminate the diversion of blood flow and restore normal circulation to the limb. However, this also means the patient loses their dialysis access, so it's typically a last resort.\\n \\n * **D.
